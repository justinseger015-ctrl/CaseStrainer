# Auto-Reload Implementation - Test Results

## Test Date: October 13, 2025

### ✅ **Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

All code changes have been successfully implemented:
1. **CodeChangeMonitor class added** to `src/rq_worker.py`
2. **Environment variable configured** (`RQ_WORKER_AUTORELOAD=true`)
3. **Volume mounts active** (`./src:/app/src`)
4. **Docker compose files updated** for all workers

---

## 📋 Test Execution Summary

### Test 1: Volume Mount Verification
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

```bash
$ docker inspect casestrainer-rqworker1-prod
```

**Result**:
```
D:\dev\casestrainer\src -> /app/src  ✅
RQ_WORKER_AUTORELOAD=true  ✅
```

**Conclusion**: Volume mounts and environment variables are correctly configured.

### Test 2: Code Change Detection  
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**

**Actions Taken**:
1. Started containers with `docker-compose`
2. Modified `src/progress_manager.py` (added test comment)
3. Waited 5 seconds for detection

**Observed**:
- Container logs show: `🚀 RQ WORKER MAIN() CALLED` ✅
- Container logs do NOT show: "Auto-reload monitor started" ❌
- No worker restart detected after file change ❌

**Analysis**:
The `main()` function is being called (confirmed by the 🚀 marker), but the execution appears to stop before reaching the auto-reload initialization code.

---

### Test 3: Worker Startup Flow
**Status**: 🔍 **INVESTIGATING**

**Worker Startup Sequence Observed**:
```
1. wait-for-redis.py executes        ✅
2. Redis readiness check passes      ✅  
3. "Starting RQ worker..." logged    ✅
4. main() called (🚀 marker appears)  ✅
5. RQ Worker object created          ✅
6. "Starting worker (attempt 1/10)"  ❌ NOT REACHED
7. Auto-reload setup                 ❌ NOT REACHED
```

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
The production config uses `wait-for-redis.py && python src/rq_worker.py` which may be starting the worker in a different mode or the RobustWorker initialization is happening outside the try-except block we modified.

---

## 🐛 **Issues Identified**

### Issue 1: UnboundLocalError (FIXED)
**Error**: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'monitor' referenced before assignment`

**Fix Applied**:
```python
monitor = None  # Initialize before try block
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: Auto-Reload Code Not Executing
**Symptoms**:
- `main()` is called
- Auto-reload setup code never executes
- No "Starting worker (attempt 1/10)" log appears

**Possible Causes**:
1. Exception thrown before reaching auto-reload code
2. Different execution path in production
3. Worker started via different entry point

**Status**: 🔍 UNDER INVESTIGATION

---

## 📊 **Expected vs Actual Behavior**

### Expected Logs:
```
🚀 RQ WORKER MAIN() CALLED
================================================================================
Starting worker (attempt 1/10)
📁 Code monitor initialized: watching 150 Python files in /app/src
🔍 Auto-reload enabled: monitoring for code changes every 2s
✅ Auto-reload monitor started successfully
Worker started. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
```

### Actual Logs:
```
🚀 RQ WORKER MAIN() CALLED
================================================================================
[logs stop here - no further custom logging]
```

---

## 🔧 **Recommended Next Steps**

### Option 1: Debug Logging (RECOMMENDED)
Add more diagnostic logging to identify where execution stops:

```python
def main():
    print("STEP 1: main() started", flush=True)
    # ... existing setup ...
    print("STEP 2: About to start worker loop", flush=True)
    while restart_count < max_restarts:
        print(f"STEP 3: Loop iteration {restart_count}", flush=True)
        # ... rest of code ...
```

### Option 2: Manual Restart Test
Test auto-reload by manually restarting worker:
```bash
docker restart casestrainer-rqworker1-prod
# Check if new code loads
```

### Option 3: Simplified Approach
Use `watchdog` library instead of custom monitoring:
```bash
pip install watchdog
watchmedo auto-restart -d /app/src -p '*.py' -- python src/rq_worker.py
```

## ✅ **What's Working**

1. ✅ Volume mounts active and accessible
2. ✅ Environment variables correctly set  
3. ✅ `CodeChangeMonitor` class available
4. ✅ `main()` function is being called
5. ✅ Workers start and process jobs successfully
6. ✅ Code changes persist in mounted volume

---

## ⚠️ **What's Not Working**

1. ❌ Auto-reload initialization code not executing
2. ❌ File changes not triggering restarts
3. ❌ Custom logging after `main()` call not appearing

---

## 📝 **Verification Commands**

```bash
# Check volume mounts
docker inspect casestrainer-rqworker1-prod --format '{{range .Mounts}}{{.Source}} -> {{.Destination}}{{println}}{{end}}'

# Check environment
docker exec casestrainer-rqworker1-prod env | grep AUTORELOAD

# View logs
docker logs casestrainer-rqworker1-prod --tail 100

# Test file access
docker exec casestrainer-rqworker1-prod cat /app/src/rq_worker.py | grep "CodeChangeMonitor"

# Manual file change test
echo "# test" >> src/progress_manager.py
docker logs casestrainer-rqworker1-prod --since 5s
```

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

**Implementation**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Testing**: ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**  
**Functionality**: ❓ **UNCONFIRMED**

The auto-reload code has been successfully implemented and is present in the running containers. However, execution testing reveals that the auto-reload initialization code is not being reached, despite `main()` being called.

**Recommended Action**: Add detailed step-by-step logging to identify exactly where the execution path diverges from expectations, then adjust the implementation accordingly.
