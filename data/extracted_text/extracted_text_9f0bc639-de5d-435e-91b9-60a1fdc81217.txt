INTRODUCTION 

An officer stopped Joseph Zamora due to a "suspicious 

person" report in the neighborhood and then claimed he resisted 

arrest, even though he had committed no crime. More officers 

arrived, and together they beat, pepper-sprayed, and tazed 

Zamora due to his alleged lack of cooperation with arrest. At 

the end of the encounter, hogtied, handcuffed, and held face 

down in the snow, Zamora had no pulse. The prosecution 

charged him with third-degree assault against two officers. 

Zamora defended he acted in reasonable self-defense against 

excessive, lethal force used against him. 

          The elected prosecutor began jury selection by repeatedly 

asked jurors to consider the danger posed by undocumented 

immigrants to the community. Zamora is not an undocumented 

immigrant, and immigration had no relevance to the case. The 

Court of Appeals agreed that illegal immigration and border 

security had no bearing but discounted the possibility it 

prejudiced Zamora. The court also barred Zamora from 

1 

 
questioning the officers about their statements during an 

internal investigation of their conduct, even though these were 

the only police reports in the case. 

            Zamora was denied a fair trial by an impartial jury as 

well as his right to meaningfully cross-examine the witnesses 

against him. 

I. 

ISSUES FOR WHICH REVIEW HAS BEEN GRANTED  

A.   A criminal defendant is guaranteed a fair trial before 

an impartial jury. Where the defendant has a Latino surname, 

did the prosecutor's extensive discussion about the dangers of 

undocumented immigrants entering the United States because 

they commit deadly crimes and bring lethal drugs undermine 

Zamora’s right to due process of law?  

2 

 
 
B.  Exercise of a criminal defendant’s constitutional 

right of confrontation and cross-examination of his accusers is 

crucial for the jury to render a just verdict based on the facts. 

Was Zamora’s constitutional right to confront his accusers 

violated when the court denied the opportunity to cross-

examine police witnesses about the circumstances of their 

statements given as part of an internal investigation into their 

conduct?  

II.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE 

The State accused Joseph Zamora (“Zamora”) of 

assaulting two police officers. CP 1-2. The incident began when 

a neighbor saw him walking through a vacant lot near parked 

cars on his way to his niece’s home. RP 287, 736. She told him 

to leave the area. Although she never saw him look into, touch, 

or press up against any cars, as he shuffled down the street, she 

called 911 to report “a suspicious person in our 

neighborhood…possibly car prowling.”  RP 289-90,302.  

3 

 
Kevin Hake1 responded to the call. RP 313-14, 317.  

He shined his flashlight at Zamora, who by that point was in the 

yard of his niece's home and called him over. RP 320, 450.  

Zamora complied, stopping about six or seven feet from Hake. 

His left hand was in his pocket. Hake speculated Zamora might 

have had drugs in his pocket. RP 320, 322, 455. 

Hake asked Zamora for identification and what he was 

doing. RP 454, 503. Zamora did not move and remained silent. 

Hake called out over his radio, “I’ve got one resisting.” RP 451, 

499, 503. Hake believed Zamora was “aggressive” by passively 

resisting interaction with him. RP 323-24, 504-05, 548-49.   

As Zamora turned to leave, Hake stuck out his arm and 

told him he was not free to go. RP 455, 551. Zamora stopped 

and then turned away. Hake told him he was not under arrest 

1At the time of the incident, Officer Hake worked for the Moses 
Lake Police Department. He left their employment four months 
later. He was introduced at trial as Hake rather than Officer 
Hake. RP 311-12.    

4 

 
 
but grabbed him from behind and intentionally put painful 

pressure on Zamora’s elbows. RP 326, 460.  

Zamora bowed his shoulders and tried to turn away. RP 

458-59. Over the mic, another officer heard Hake say, "Put your 

hands behind your back, I'll fucking kill you, put your hands 

behind your back." RP 644. After an unsuccessful leg sweep, 

Hake shoved Zamora, who flew back six or seven feet and hit 

his head on a truck bumper. RP 462,464-65,467. 

The altercation escalated. Hake used a chokehold until he 

heard Zamora gasp and go silent. RP 472-73. Hake believed 

deadly force was authorized. RP 548. Hake shot pepper spray in 

Zamora’s mouth and face and punched him between 75 and 120 

times in the face, eyes, ears, nose, and rib cage. RP 358, 506-

07, 515. Zamora bucked to get free and not allow himself to be 

handcuffed. He struck Hake in the shoulder and torso. RP 492-

93, 506.  

Hake felt Zamora grab his utility belt and his holstered 

gun several times. RP 474. His gun had a three-point retention 

5 

 
system, meaning it took three separate and distinct maneuvers 

to remove the weapon. RP 483-84. Hake admitted that were 

Zamora trying to get out from underneath him, he would have 

used the utility belt items as leverage to pull himself up; and it 

was possible someone would grab the holster without intending 

to remove the gun. RP 479-80.  

The firearm never left the holster until Hake drew his 

weapon and put it in Zamora’s eye, ear and eventually shoved it 

down his throat. RP 370, 485, 514.  

Backup officers arrived within minutes, and they also 

pepper-sprayed, punched, kicked, and tazed Zamora repeatedly. 

RP 526, 630-3, 653, 692-93, 828. Hake punched Zamora as 

hard as he could another 12-20 times. RP 375.  

Officers handcuffed Zamora and used a rope to hogtie 

him. RP 637. While he was handcuffed, hogtied, and held face 

down in the snow, Zamora stopped breathing. RP 676, 680-81. 

One officer activated his body camera after Zamora was 

6 

 
hogtied. RP 676. Paramedics restarted Zamora’s heart twice 

before transporting him to the hospital. RP 847-50.  

The Investigation and Court Ruling 

The Washington State Patrol investigated the charges of 

assault against Zamora. RP 734-42. No officer prepared a 

police report, and officers did not participate in any interviews 

about their role in seizing Zamora. RP 233. Officers had been 

directed to prepare a Garrity2 statement. RP 233-34. The WSP 

investigator’s report of the incident was limited to a summary 

of the Garrity statements. RP 232.   

Defense counsel argued the Garrity statement 

circumstances went directly to witness credibility, seeking to 

2	A Garrity statement is a statement made by a public employee 
during an internal investigation. The Fifth Amendment 
prohibits the government from using self-incriminating 
statements made by a public employee under threat of 
termination in a subsequent criminal prosecution. Garrity v. 
New Jersey,385 U.S. 493, 499-500, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 
562 (1967). The officer’s statements were “compelled” and thus 
inadmissible against them because officers would have been 
terminated had they remained silent. Id. at 497-98.	

7 

 
 
ask officers if (1) if they made a Garrity statement as part of the 

investigation (2) whether they knew what a Garrity statement 

was (3) if they knew the purpose of making a Garrity statement 

(4) who told them to make a Garrity statement, and (5) if the 

officers made themselves available for interview by Sergeant 

Anderson investigating the case against Zamora. RP 332-33, 

338, 401-02, 414-15 419-20. 

Over defense objection, the court granted the State’s 

motion barring reference to the investigation into officer 

misconduct. CP 164; RP 330,338. The court ruled the questions 

irrelevant, and a waste of time. RP 340, 433-34.    

Voir Dire 

The elected prosecutor began voir dire: 

let's just take a general topic that seems to be in the 
media every day, and I'll ask you a general question, and 
that is some people say today in our society we have -- 
we don't have enough border security. Some people say 
we have too much or we don't need that. So, the question 
is which one do you feel like you're closer to?  

RP 71-72.  

8 

 
One juror responded not just immigrants committed 

crimes. RP 75. The prosecutor responded by asking whether 

venire members could make room for the possibility that others 

had loved ones killed or problems with someone "previously 

deported or criminally is wrong in the country, that that 

happens to them, and that they feel like we need more border 

security…." RP 75.  

Juror Talbot pointed out,  

I feel like people are focusing more on the race aspect 
instead of like white illegal immigrants coming in. 

 RP 76.  

The prosecutor responded: 

If you don’t believe a wall would help, do you lock your 
door? 

 RP 76.  

DANO: Can you make room for the idea that when they 
hear that 100,000 people come across illegally a month, 
and of those we've got people from countries that -- 
countries on our list that aren't even allowed in the 
country are part of that group? 

9 

 
 
 
 
JUROR TALBOT: Yes. 

DANO: That they feel that we've got a big problem and a 
porous border, meaning people are just coming across 
and we don't know who is here, that a lot of people have 
some fear about that. Can you make room for that?  

RP 77. 

The prosecutor asked jurors about border security at least 

four more times. RP 88,92,97,160. Later, the prosecutor 

continued the line of questioning by asking if a juror was 

concerned with the methamphetamine problem and followed up 

with:  

How many people on the jury… heard about the recent drug 
bust down at Nogales, Arizona where they picked up enough 
what’s called Fentanyl that would have killed 65 million 
Americans. 

RP 139.  

Defense counsel questioned whether jurors believed 

Zamora must be guilty because he had been charged with a 

crime. One juror responded:  

I'm married to a Mexican, have a Mexican daughter, 
something about a wall, I really don't know. But police 
and my family, and grandpa. I’m not really sure…. 

10 

 
 
 
 RP 190.  

The following day the trial court addressed defense 

counsel: 

[w]as there a strategic or tactical reason that you didn't 
object about the plaintiff's questions and comments on 
voir dire about crimes being committed by what was 
described as illegal immigrants passing through the 
United States/Mexico border? 

RP 220-221. Counsel said he thought about objecting, adding “I 

have heard similar comments in voir dire.” Counsel thought he 

could use the comments to his advantage. RP 221,224. 

Concerned about its responsibility to be proactive, the court 

referenced case law and ER  413. RP 227. The court asked:  

…does this jury think that with a Latino last name that 
he’s here illegally? Why else would the questions be 
asked? Why else would there be reference to drug busts 
in Nogales, a number of illegal immigrants crossing over 
the border 100,000 a month, unless he was, why else 
would the questions be relevant? That’s what the jurors 
might think.  

RP 223. 

11 

 
 
 
 
The elected prosecutor denied he had brought “up the 

specific points” and then explained he was just curious about 

how people felt about border security. RP 224-25. He denied 

having raised the issues, saying he responded to the venire. RP 

226. That was followed by stating he was “troubled” by “this 

overarching complete political correctness about what people 

have to say and concerns.” RP 226.  

In response to the court’s concerns about being proactive, 

the elected prosecutor cited to Justice Thomas asking a defense 

attorney if she had struck all the white jurors in a case involving 

a black defendant. The prosecutor opined that judges, who may 

lack experience as trial attorneys, should let lawyers try the case 

"unless we're doing something that's prejudicial to the other 

side" or "engaging in something that's improper.” RP 229-30.  

III.  ARGUMENT 

12 

 
 
 
A. The Elected Prosecutor Violated Zamora’s 

Constitutional Right To An Impartial Jury And Fair 

Proceedings By Repeatedly Encouraging Racially 

Based Stereotypes And Bias During Voir Dire. 

Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a fair 

and impartial jury. U.S.Const. Amend. 6, U.S. Const. Amend. 

14; Wash. Const. Art.1 §§ 3, 22; State v. Davis,141 Wn.2d 798, 

824 10 P.3d 977 (2000). An impartial jury means "an unbiased 

and unprejudiced jury," which is the defendant's "fundamental 

protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice." 

McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 310, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 

L.Ed.2d 262 (1987); State v. Berhe, 193 Wn.2d 647, 658, 444 

P3d 1172 (2019).  

A prosecutor violates the fundamental right to a fair trial 

and undermines faith in the justice system when he appeals to 

racist stereotypes and bias. State v. Monday, 171 Wn.2d 667, 

678, 257 P.3d 551 (2011). “Theories and arguments based upon 

13 

 
racial, ethnic and most other stereotypes are antithetical to and 

impermissible in a fair and impartial trial.” Id.  

 “The Equal Protection clause was central to the 

Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibition of discriminatory 

action…discrimination on the basis of race, odious in all 

aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of 

justice.” Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 555-56, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 

61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979). Racial bias implicates historical, 

constitutional, and institutional concerns, with the goal being to 

ensure the legal system remains capable of realizing the 

promise of equal treatment under the law. Pena-Rodriguez v. 

Colorado, 137 S.Ct. 855, 868, 197 L.Ed.2d 107 (2017).  

Washington Courts have condemned racism and 

stereotypes injected into criminal proceedings. The persistence 

of “racial and ethnic disproportionality in [Washington’s] 

criminal justice system is indisputable.” State v. Saintcalle, 178 

Wn.2d 34, 54, 309 P.3d 326 (2013), (abrogated on other 

grounds by City of Seattle v. Erickson, 188 Wn.2d 721, 398 

14 

 
P.3d 1124 (2017)) quoting Task Force on Race & Criminal 

Justice Sys., Preliminary Report on Race and Washington’s 

Criminal Justice System 1 (2011). 

Finding it offends “society’s standards of decency” and 

“fundamental fairness” to permit application of the death 

penalty when racial bias plays a role in determining upon whom 

it is imposed, this Court invalidated the death penalty. State v. 

Gregory, 192 Wn.2d 1, 427 P.3d 621 (2018). Statistical 

evidence showed jurors significantly more likely to impose the 

death penalty on black defendants than similarly situated white 

defendants.  

In Jefferson, this Court understood the need and adopted a 

new Batson framework to challenge racial discrimination in the 

justice system. This Court identified the relevant question as 

whether a reasonable person who is aware of the history of 

explicit racial discrimination in America and how it impacts our 

current decision making in nonexplicit or implicit, unstated 

ways, could view race or ethnicity as a factor in the use of 

15 

 
peremptory challenge. State v. Jefferson, 192 Wn.2d 225, 249-

50, 429 P.3d 467 (2018). “The evil of racial discrimination is 

still the evil this rule seeks to eradicate.” Id.  

This same rigor must be applied to voir dire. “Voir dire is 

where racial stereotypes and inflammatory history can be 

planted like a mustard seed at the infancy of a case, tainting all 

that follows.” State v. Ellis, 2021 WL 3910557 (August 21, 

2021).3 “Prosecutorial misconduct of this ilk has a similar effect 

on the court system as a whole. One occurrence hurts the 

credibility of the entirety; for this reason, such conduct is taken 

seriously.” Id.n.4.  

Implicit biases are pervasive4. Studies have provided 

insight into the substantial effect of racial bias jurors have about

and is not binding on the Court. It may be accorded such 
persuasive value as the Court deems appropriate.

the criminal propensity of Hispanic men. The Sentencing 

Project, Race and Punishment; Racial Perceptions and Crime 

and Support for Punitive Penalties, 13-14 (2014).5  Implicit 

bias tests demonstrate the general public holds negative 

associations of Latinos and suspects them of criminality. Id. at 

13-14. Persistent implicit racial bias exists even among 

individuals who explicitly disavow prejudice because it lies at 

the unconscious level. Id.; State v. Berhe, 193 Wn.2d at 657.  

Jury selection is to discover biases in prospective jurors 

and excuse those who cannot follow instructions on the law. 

State v. Davis, 141 Wn.2d at 825-25. “Generic questions about 

juror impartiality may not expose specific attitudes or biases 

that can poison jury deliberations. Yet more pointed questions 

‘could well exacerbate whatever prejudice might exist without 

substantially aiding in exposing it.” State v. Behre, 193 Wn.2d 

5  https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/race-and-
punishment-racial-perceptions-of-crime-and-support-for-
punitive-policies/. (last visited 11/30/21).

at 659 (quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 

195, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981)(Rehnquist, J. 

concurring in result).  

“[R]esearch suggests that ... [c]alling attention to implicit 

racial bias can encourage jurors to view the evidence without 

the usual preconceptions and automatic associations involving 

race that most of us make.” Cynthia Lee, A New Approach to 

Voir Dire on Racial Bias, 5 UC Irvine L. Rev. 843, 846 (2015). 

However, race must be made salient without at the same time 

triggering detrimental associations or stereotype threats. Id. at 

846-47.  

A prosecutor's invocation of racial and ethnic stereotypes 

is not always blatant. "Perhaps more effective but just as 

insidious are subtle references. Like wolves in sheep's clothing, 

a careful word here and there can trigger racial bias." State v. 

Monday, 171 Wn.2d at 678. 

Here, in the prosecution of a Latino man, the elected 

prosecutor singled out Latinos in his first sentences to the jury 

18 

 
venire without ever saying Latino. He used voir dire to inflame 

stereotypes, conjuring images of Latinos coming over the 

border at 100,000 per month, bringing crime and drugs. For 

jurors who did not believe a border wall was necessary, the 

prosecutor wanted to know if they locked their doors at night to 

keep unwanted people from entering their home.  

In other words, "they" are coming over the border with 

crime and drugs to do you harm, and if you don't stop them at 

the border, will you stop them at your front door? The line of 

questioning was not only a profoundly inflammatory and 

offensive racial stereotype, but it effectively and improperly 

linked Zamora, a Latino, to crime and a border wall. When 

asked if the defendant was guilty because he had been charged, 

one juror answered:  

I’m married to a Mexican, have a Mexican daughter, 
something about a wall, I really don’t know. But police 
and my family, and grandpa. I’m not really sure…. 

RP 190.  

She had gotten the message: Mexican. Wall. Police. Family.  

19 

 
Understanding the scientifically documented implicit bias 

linking Latinos and crime, the prosecutor’s questioning 

exacerbated whatever prejudice might exist, encouraging 

potential jurors to “make room” for the idea that undocumented 

immigrants commit crimes against people’s loved ones.   

In Loughbom, this Court found it deeply troubling where 

the prosecutor created a thematic narrative prism to view the 

defendant's prosecution: the war on drugs. State v. Loughbom, 

196 Wn.2d 64, 77, 470 P.3d 488 (2020). During jury selection, 

the prosecutor connected the “war on drugs” to the “drug 

problem in Lincoln County” during jury selection. Id. The 

prosecutor committed flagrant and ill-intentioned misconduct 

because the questions were designed to arouse passion and 

prejudice and inflame the jurors' emotions, resulting in an 

unfair trial. Id. at 77-78.   

Here, the misconduct is far more egregious. 100,000 

immigrants illegally entering the United States, a border wall, 

20 

 
 
illegal importation of Fentanyl, or loved ones killed by 

undocumented immigrants had nothing to do with the facts.  

Even had defense counsel objected to the improper 

questioning, the bell rung by intentionally returning to the 

irrelevant theme could not be unrung. Scientists have found 

“the amygdala activity (a part of the brain previously identified 

in emotional, fear and threat assessment) is triggered when 

implicit biases take hold in response to racialized images. 

Consequently, neuroscience confirms the validity of implicit 

associations tests that demonstrate the attitudes underlying 

America's racial hierarchy.”6  

Anyone watching even one day of the national news 

between 2016 and 2019 understood the imagery and the 

emotion.  

6 Steven A. Ramirez & Neil G. Williams, On the Permanence 
of Racial Injustice and the Possibility of Deracialization, 69 
Case W. Res. L. Rev. 299, 325–26 (2018) 

21 

 
 
	
The verdict depended on the jury’s perception of Zamora 

and whether it believed he fought back in self-defense. 

Conjuring up images of Latinos as dangerous trespassers who 

brought crime and drugs to the United States undermined his 

credibility and the presumption of innocence.  

As quasi-judicial officers, prosecutors are held to a 

higher standard than other attorneys. State v. Monday, 171 

Wn.2d at 676; Rules of Professional Conduct 3.8. Justice 

inevitably falls prey to prejudice when the prosecutor invokes 

racist stereotypes to the venire.   

Where “a prosecutor flagrantly or apparently appeals to 

racial bias so it undermines the defendant’s credibility or the 

presumption of innocence, we will vacate the conviction unless 

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the misconduct did 

not affect the jury’s verdict.” Id. at 680. The Court assigns the 

burden to the State to show the race-based misconduct was 

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Gentry, 170 Wn.2d 

614, 623, 316 P.3d 1020 (2014).  

22 

 
Because it is almost impossible to quantify the effect of 

racially or ethnically based bias, the Court has even condemned 

language that was not overtly derogatory. In Torres, the 

prosecutor referred to the defendants as Mexicans or Mexican 

Americans. The Court held the proceedings unfair because the 

effect may have been to impugn the standing of the defendants 

and intimate they were more likely than those of other races to 

commit the crimes charged. State v. Torres, 16 Wn.App. 254, 

257, 554 P.2d 1069 (1976). Discrimination is not “any less 

pernicious” if it is not documented by outright slurs. Saintcalle, 

178 Wn.2d at 48-49.   

In this case, the pernicious nature of the questioning and 

theme had an expansive potential for triggering implicit bias. In 

Monday, this Court found that even in the face of 

overwhelming evidence of guilt, the State could not show the 

jury's verdict was not affected by the misconduct beyond a 

reasonable doubt. Monday, 171 Wn.2d at 681.  

23 

 
Here, the evidence was not overwhelming. This Court 

should come to the same conclusion in this matter. Because the 

flagrant and repeated appeals to racial bias undermined 

Zamora’s presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, and 

the State cannot show otherwise, this Court should vacate the 

convictions.  

 The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion  

Voir dire is a critical stage of criminal proceedings, and 

the trial court maintains inherent authority and discretion in 

determining how to conduct it. State v. Davis, 141 Wn.2d at 

826; CR 6.4(b). “A trial court’s exercise of discretion is limited 

only when the record reveals the court abused its discretion and 

thus prejudiced the defendant’s right to a fair trial by an 

impartial jury.” Davis, 141 Wn.2d at 826. “The question 

becomes one of determining at what point the risk of racial 

prejudice becomes constitutionally unacceptable.” Id. at 828.   

Here, the court knew the dangers of the prosecutor’s 

questioning. The court cited State v. Avendano-Lopez, 79 

24 

 
 
 
Wn.App. 706, 718, 904 P.2d 324 (1995), (prosecutor’s question 

was grossly improper when he asked the defendant whether he 

was legally in the United States) and State v. Belgarde, 110 

Wn.2d 504, 508,755 P.2d 174 (1988)(“a prosecutor has no right 

to call to the attention of the jury matters of considerations 

which the jurors have no right to consider.”). It was keenly 

aware that even if Zamora were an undocumented immigrant, 

ER 413 provided specific guard rails for precluding 

undocumented status from being made known to jurors.  

The appeal to implicit or explicit racial bias can influence 

decisions without our being aware of it “because we suppress it 

and because we create it anew through cognitive processes that 

have nothing to do with racial animus.” State v. Saintcalle, 178 

Wn.2d at 46.  

Defense counsel’s statement “I have heard similar 

comments in voir dire” demonstrates the appeal to racial bias in 

voir dire questioning is not unusual in Grant County. Where 

justice may turn on the innuendo that the color of a man’s skin, 

25 

 
 
or his country of origin, or his primary language, or the status 

of his citizenship should determine his fate as a criminal 

defendant, the court necessarily abuses its discretion when it 

does not curtail the improper questioning.   

B.   Zamora’s Right To Confront His Accusers Was 

Violated When He Was Denied A Full and Fair Cross-

Examination of Witnesses Against Him. 

The State and Federal Constitutions guarantee the right to 

confront and cross-examine an adverse witness. U.S. Const. 

Amend.6, Wash. Const. art. I §22. Confrontation clause 

violations are reviewed de novo. State v. Jasper, 174 Wn.2d 96, 

108, 271 P.3d 876 (2012).  

The right to confront grants criminal defendants extra-

wide latitude in cross-examination to probe motive or 

credibility. Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308. 316-17, 94 S.Ct. 

1105, 399 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). If exclusion of evidence violates 

constitutional protections, the State bears the burden of proving 

26 

 
beyond a reasonable doubt the constitutional error was 

harmless. State v. Orn, 197 Wn.2d 343, 482 P.3d 913 (2021).   

The heart of this case was whether the police used 

excessive force. The circumstances of the investigation bore 

directly on officer credibility. The officers had been directed to 

prepare a Garrity statement, explaining their conduct as part of 

an internal investigation. Public employees who choose not to 

prepare a statement may be terminated from employment. 

Garrity v. New Jersey,385 U.S. 493, 497-98, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 

L.Ed.2d 562 (1967). They were guaranteed the State would not 

criminally prosecute officers based on their statement. Id. at 

499-500 

The prosecution of Zamora stemmed from the Garrity 

statements. No officer filed a police report. No officer was 

interviewed by the State Patrol officer, who used the written 

Garrity statements to investigate Zamora. The jury did not learn 

these facts because the court found the information irrelevant.  

27 

 
In a jury trial, the jury determines whether to believe any 

witnesses and which witnesses to believe. It is the sole and 

exclusive judge of credibility. State v. Coryell, 197 Wn.2d 397, 

414, 483 P.3d 98 (2021) 

For purposes of witness credibility, the test of relevancy 

is not whether the answer will expound any of the main issues 

but whether it will aid the jury in appraising the witness's 

credibility and assessing the probative value of his testimony. 

Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. at 316.   

Police officers are routinely questioned on their police 

reports as part of credibility inquiry: whether they had training 

in writing reports, whether they wrote a report on the day of the 

incident, whether they worked with a partner who wrote a 

report, and whether their report reflected verbatim 

conversations with witnesses.  

Here, the trial court improperly resolved the credibility 

issue by not allowing the jury to learn that the officers had not 

filed a police report in the regular custom but had been the 

28 

 
subjects of an investigation for their conduct. By precluding 

questions that would give the jury the benefit of a complete 

picture of the alarming seriousness of the police conduct, the 

court prevented the jury from having the issue fully presented 

allowing a fair rendering of a verdict based on all the facts.  

In Robinson v. State of Maryland, 354 Md.287, 730 A.2d 

181(1999) the trial judge informed the jury an internal affairs 

investigation had occurred after officers fired their weapons. 

The defendant stated he never had a gun, was not involved in a 

robbery, and when he got out of the car with his hands up, the 

officers shot him anyway. Id. at 315. The judge told the jury an 

investigation cleared the officers of wrongdoing, and there was 

nothing exculpatory for the defendant in their statements, and 

for that reason, neither the investigation nor the statements 

would be admitted. Id.   

In reversing the conviction, the Court found error in the 

trial judge's refusal to allow the defendant to review the prior 

statements of the officers, and even more significantly, in 

29 

 
commenting on the credibility of the witnesses, i.e., that the 

officers were cleared of wrongdoing. Id. at 318. 

Here, the Court of Appeals relied on the State’s argument 

that since all the officers were cleared of wrongdoing, it was 

irrelevant there had been an investigation.  

The trial court here did what the trial court in Robinson 

did: it just determined credibility by omission rather than 

commission.  

In the context of officers owing a duty to exercise 

reasonable care when serving a search warrant, this Court held 

that “police, just like other people, must exercise ordinary 

reasonable care ‘to refrain from causing foreseeable harm in 

interactions with others’…This duty ‘applies in the context of 

law enforcement and encompasses the duty to refrain from 

directly causing harm to another through affirmative acts of 

misfeasance.” Mancini v City of Tacoma, 196 Wn.2d 864, 886, 

479 P.3d 656 (2021). The Court held: “But the jury is the sole 

judge of the credibility of witnesses, and whether the overall 

30 

 
conduct of the police was reasonable was an ultimate fact to be 

decided by the jury.” Id.at 887. 

Zamora was denied the right to conduct a full cross-

examination on the central issue in this case: whether police 

used such excessive force that Zamora was in fear for his life 

and entitled to defend himself. A reasonable jury, hearing all 

the facts, could have reasonably concluded that Zamora was 

justified in protecting himself and acquitted him on all charges.
