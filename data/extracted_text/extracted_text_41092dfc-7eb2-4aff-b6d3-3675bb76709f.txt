A.  INTRODUCTION 

Lance Thomason, poor enough to be found indigent in 

this case, picked up less than $15 in food items in a grocery 

store and left without paying.  Outside, a security guard 

grabbed him, and he struck the guard and ran away.  The 

State charged Mr. Thomason with first-degree robbery, 

reduced to second-degree robbery at trial, a class B felony. 

The trial court felt a standard-range sentence would be 

harsh.  It observed Mr. Thomason’s conduct fell into a unique 

category of cases where “a chain of events with security 

personnel” turns a petty theft into a robbery.  Clearly, in the 

court’s view, that the theft was minor and that Mr. Thomason 

used force only when a security guard confronted him were 

mitigating circumstances.  When Mr. Thomason requested an 

exceptional sentence, however, the court insisted it lacked 

discretion to depart below the standard range.  As a result, 

Mr. Thomason is currently serving a sentence in excess of five 

years for what the trial court called a “glorified shoplifting.”  

1 

 
 
B.  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR 

1.  The trial court abused its discretion in refusing to 

consider Mr. Thomason’s request for an exceptional sentence. 

2.  Mr. Thomason’s trial counsel rendered ineffective 

assistance in failing to object to pervasive and prejudicial 

improper testimony by law enforcement witnesses. 

3.  The trial court erred in imposing a crime-related 

prohibition with a term longer than the statutory maximum 

sentence for second-degree robbery. 

4.  The trial court erred in including a discretionary 

legal financial obligation in the judgment and sentence 

despite finding Mr. Thomason indigent and waiving 

discretionary fees and costs during the sentencing hearing. 

C.  ISSUES PERTAINING TO ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR 

1.  A trial court abuses its discretion when it refuses to 

consider a request for a downward exceptional sentence in the 

erroneous belief that it lacks discretion to do so.  Here, the 

court identified a mitigating circumstance during 

sentencing—Mr. Thomason’s conduct fell in a category of 

2 

 
“glorified shoplifting” distinct from the crime of robbery in 

general, consisting of de minimis theft inside the store 

followed by relatively minor force to evade security outside 

the store.  Nonetheless, the court insisted it lacked discretion 

to depart below the standard range.  Did the trial court abuse 

its discretion in failing to consider an exceptional sentence? 

2.  Ineffective assistance of counsel requires reversal 

where counsel’s performance was deficient and prejudice 

results.  Here, two police officers’ testimony was rife with 

improper propensity evidence, improper opinion, hearsay, and 

a violation of the best evidence rule.  Nonetheless, trial 

counsel did not interpose a single objection.  This 

unchallenged, improper testimony raised the risk the jury 

would overlook weaknesses in the State’s case and convict 

based solely on the aura of reliability surrounding law 

enforcement witnesses.  Does trial counsel’s ineffective 

assistance require reversal of Mr. Thomason’s conviction of 

second-degree robbery? 

3 

 
3.  A trial court may not impose a crime-related 

prohibition with a term in excess of the statutory maximum 

sentence for the offense of conviction.  Second-degree robbery 

is a class B felony, with a maximum sentence of ten years.  

The court, however, imposed a no-contact order with a 

lifetime term.  Did the trial court err in imposing a 

prohibition with a term in excess of the statutory maximum? 

4.  Supervision fees are a discretionary legal financial 

obligation that may not be imposed on an indigent defendant.  

Did the trial court err in including supervision fees in Mr. 

Thomason’s judgment and sentence despite finding him 

indigent and indicating its intent to waive all discretionary 

fees and costs during the sentencing hearing? 

D.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE 

The State alleged Mr. Thomason took $14.98 in 

merchandise from Yoke’s Fresh Market, a grocery store, and 

later punched a security guard who confronted him outside.  

CP 2.  On this basis, the State charged Mr. Thomason with 

4 

 
one count of first-degree robbery, reduced to second-degree 

robbery on the first day of trial.  RP 14; CP 1, 46. 

The security guard, Daniel Swartz, testified that he 

saw Mr. Thomason and another man enter the store together.  

RP 124.1  He observed Mr. Thomason walk to the “lunch 

meat” section and remove one package each of hot dogs and 

sliced cheese from a cooler.  RP 124–25.  He then saw Mr. 

Thomason walk to the “meat department” and pick up a 

“package of hamburger.”  RP 125. 

In plain clothes to blend in with customers, Mr. Swartz 

surreptitiously began to follow Mr. Thomason through the 

store.  RP 123, 126.  When Mr. Thomason walked down an 

aisle in the “natural food” section, Mr. Swartz headed down 

an adjacent aisle.  RP 126.  Mr. Swartz did not keep eyes on 

Mr. Thomason throughout, but watched Mr. Thomason’s   

reflection in the doors of a row of coolers.  RP 126–27, 145.  

When Mr. Thomason walked into a gap in a “split aisle,” Mr. 

1 Citations to the verbatim report of proceedings 
without specifying a date are to the trial, held January 13 and 
14, 2020. 

5 

 
                                                
Swartz hid behind a display and “peered around the corner” 

and “between the cracks.”  RP 127, 145–46.  At this point, Mr. 

Swartz testified, Mr. Thomason concealed the food items 

“[d]own the front of his pants.”  RP 127.   

Mr. Thomason walked to the store’s exit, and Mr. 

Swartz followed.  RP 127–28.  Outside, Mr. Swartz grabbed 

Mr. Thomason’s arm, showed him a badge, and “asked him to 

come back in the store.”  RP 129–30.  Mr. Thomason tried to 

pull himself free, and Mr. Swartz shouted at him to “stop 

resisting.”  RP 130–31. 

Mr. Thomason swung a fist at Mr. Swartz three times, 

hitting him in the face the third time.  RP 131–32.  At this 

point, Mr. Thomason escaped Mr. Swartz’s grasp by slipping 

out of his sweatshirt, and ran.  RP 131–32.  In light of the low 

value of the items, Mr. Swartz let him go.  RP 133, 157–58. 

Mr. Swartz called 911.  RP 133.  While on the phone 

with dispatch, Mr. Swartz got in his car, drove around the 

neighborhood until he spotted Mr. Thomason running down 

the street, and followed him.  RP 138–39.  Mr. Thomason ran 

6 

 
into a house.  RP 139.  Soon afterward, the friend Mr. 

Thomason had entered Yoke’s with pulled up in a car, and 

Mr. Thomason exited the house and got in.  RP 139.  Mr. 

Swartz reported the car’s license plate and returned to Yoke’s.  

RP 139. 

The State played surveillance video recorded at Yoke’s 

for the jury.  RP 141.  The video supported Mr. Swartz’s 

testimony in some respects, in that it showed a man in a grey 

sweatshirt and cap—identified by Mr. Swartz as Mr. 

Thomason—enter Yoke’s, and a man in a black T-shirt and 

jeans—identified by Mr. Swartz as himself—follow the man in 

the gray sweatshirt through the store.  RP 142–43; Ex. P-22 

at IMG_0166.MOV, IMG_0167.MOV, IMG_0168.MOV, 

IMG_0171.MOV.2  But at each point in the video when Mr. 

Thomason is supposed to have taken merchandise or 

concealed it in his clothes, the action took place off camera or 

2 Exhibit P-22, the Yoke’s surveillance video, consists of 

11 video files in .MOV format.

behind an obstruction.  RP 144–46; Ex. P-22 at 

IMG_0167.MOV, IMG_0168.MOV. 

Mr. Thomason’s mother, Kathy Thomason, was called 

by the State to testify.  RP 111–12.  Kathy3 said police came 

to her house, which is near Yoke’s, to ask whether anyone had 

gone into the house on the day of the incident.  RP 113.  She 

showed the officers footage recorded by surveillance cameras 

installed at the house, which depicted Mr. Thomason walking 

through a “side garden” on Kathy’s property.  RP 114.  The 

officers did not try to collect the surveillance footage.  RP 171. 

Spokane police officers Ron Van Tassel and Darryl 

Groom testified as well.  Officer Van Tassel related his visit to 

Kathy’s house and review of the surveillance footage recorded 

there.  RP 167–68.  The officer recited Kathy’s out-of-court 

statement that Mr. Swartz’s description of the Yoke’s suspect 

sounded like Mr. Thomason.  RP 167–68.  He also described 

the contents of the video, despite admitting he could have 

3 Kathy’s first name is used to distinguish her from Mr. 

Thomason; no disrespect is intended. 

8 

 
                                                
collected the video himself and was unable to explain why he 

did not.  RP 168–69, 171.  He further said that he was able to 

identify Mr. Thomason based on “[p]hotographs that we have 

through our system, our computer system.”  RP 169.  Mr. 

Thomason’s trial counsel raised no objections to any of Officer 

Van Tassel’s testimony.  RP 161–72. 

Officer Groom recalled going to Yoke’s, speaking to Mr. 

Swartz, and reviewing surveillance video.  RP 176–78.  The 

officer recited Mr. Swartz’s out-of-court statements about the 

incident, as well as Kathy’s statements to Officer Van Tassel 

about her son matching Mr. Swartz’s description of the 

suspect.  RP 177–78, 184.  He also identified Mr. Thomason 

as the suspect in court, despite never having seen him before 

trial except in the surveillance video played for the jury.  RP 

184–85.  Trial counsel did not object to any of Officer Groom’s 

testimony either.  RP 174–85. 

The jury found Mr. Thomason guilty.  CP 62.  At 

sentencing, the State recommended a sentence at the low end 

of the standard range: 63 months.  1/23/20 RP 4.  Trial 

9 

 
counsel joined the State’s recommendation.  1/23/20 RP 6.  

Mr. Thomason, however, personally requested an “exceptional 

sentence” of 12 months.  1/23/20 RP 9. 

The court expressed frustration with what it called a 

“glorified shoplifting charge,” in which “someone shoplifts and 

it ends up turning into a robbery because of a chain of events 

with security personnel generally, just like what happened 

here.”  1/23/20 RP 10.  Nonetheless, the court insisted the 

“only discretion” it had was to impose a standard-range 

sentence.  1/23/20 RP 10.  It imposed a sentence of 63 months, 

remarking it lacked “discretion to go lower than that.”  

1/23/20 RP 12; CP 103–04.  It also imposed a “lifetime” no-

contact order in favor of Mr. Swartz.  1/23/20 RP 12; CP 108. 

The court found Mr. Thomason indigent, waived the 

$200 filing fee, and declined to impose the $100 DNA 

collection fee.  1/23/20 RP 12; CP 106–07.  It remarked it 

would “prefer to waive” the mandatory $500 victim penalty 

assessment, but of course had no choice but to impose it.  

1/23/20 RP 12; CP 106.  Nonetheless, boilerplate language in 

10 

 
the form judgment and sentence required Mr. Thomason to 

“pay supervision fees” as a condition of community custody.  

CP 105.  The court also ordered restitution in the “de 

minimis” amount of $14.98.  1/23/20 RP 12; CP 107. 

E.  ARGUMENT 

1.  The trial court abused its discretion by sentencing Mr. 

Thomason in the erroneous belief that it lacked 
discretion to sentence below the standard range. 

The Legislature enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 

1981 (“SRA”) to “insure that sentences are commensurate 

with the punishment imposed on others committing similar 

offenses.”  State v. Law, 110 Wn. App. 36, 43, 36 P.3d 374 

(2002) (citing RCW 9.94A.010(3)).  The SRA “structures” 

sentencing discretion by requiring trial courts to determine 

an “offender score” based on the defendant’s criminal history 

and look up the offense’s “seriousness level.”  RCW 9.94A.010; 

RCW 9.94A.515; RCW 9.94A.525.  With this information, the 

trial court determines a “standard sentence range,” from 

within which the court selects the sentence “it deems 

appropriate.”  RCW 9.94A.530(1). 

11 

 
The trial court is not constrained to sentence within the 

standard range in all cases.  If it finds “substantial and 

compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence,” it may 

depart downward and impose a sentence below the standard 

range.  RCW 9.94A.535.  The SRA lists mitigating 

circumstances a court may consider, but makes clear the 

listed factors “are illustrative only” and not “exclusive reasons 

for exceptional sentences.”  RCW 9.94A.535(1). 

Generally speaking, a sentence within the standard 

range cannot be appealed.  RCW 9.94A.585(1).  This provision 

does not prevent review, however, “where the court has 

refused to exercise discretion” as to whether to impose an 

exceptional sentence.  State v. McFarland, 189 Wn.2d 47, 56, 

399 P.3d 1106 (2017) (quoting State v. McGill, 112 Wn. App. 

95, 100, 47 P.3d 173 (2002)).  “While no defendant is entitled 

to an exceptional sentence below the standard range, every 

defendant is entitled to ask the trial court to consider such a 

sentence and to have the alternative actually considered.”  

State v. Grayson, 154 Wn.2d 333, 342, 111 P.3d 1183 (2005).  

12 

 
One way a court refuses to exercise discretion is by imposing 

a standard range sentence in the erroneous belief it lacks 

discretion to depart downward.  McGill, 112 Wn. App.  at 100. 

Here, counsel for both parties believed that the 

standard range for Mr. Thomason’s single count of second-

degree robbery was 63 to 84 months.  1/23/20 RP 4, 6.  Both 

recommended a low-end sentence of 63 months.  Id. at 4, 7.  

During allocution, however, Mr. Thompson asked the court to 

consider an “exceptional sentence” of 12 months.  Id. at 8–9. 

The trial court expressed unease with the severity of 

the recommended low-end sentence.  1/23/20 RP 10.  

Nevertheless, the court believed it lacked discretion to impose 

a sentence below the standard range of 63 to 84 months.  Id.  

“That’s the only discretion I have.  I wish I had more.”  Id. 

The unique nature of Mr. Thomason’s offense conduct—

a poor person’s theft of a small amount of food inside the store 

followed by a struggle with a security guard outside the 

store—was a mitigating circumstance the court could 

consider.  The court therefore abused its discretion in 

13 

 
imposing a standard-range sentence in the erroneous belief 

that it lacked discretion to depart downward.  Because the 

court suggested it might consider an exceptional sentence if it 

knew it was able to, remand is required. 

a.  That the crime was a “glorified shoplifting”— de 
minimis food items taken followed by relatively 
minor force to evade security—was a valid 
mitigating factor to support an exceptional sentence. 

Whether a factor not listed in RCW 9.94A.535(1) may 

support a downward departure from the standard range turns 

on a “two-part test.”  State v. O’Dell, 183 Wn.2d 680, 690, 358 

P.3d 359 (2015) (citing State v. Ha’mim, 132 Wn.2d 834, 840, 

940 P.2d 633 (1997)).  First, the factor cannot be one the 

Legislature “necessarily considered . . . when it established 

the standard sentence range.”  Id.  Second, the “factor must 

be ‘sufficiently substantial and compelling to distinguish the 

crime in question from others in the same category.”  Id. 

(quoting Ha’mim, 132 Wn.2d at 840). 

The manner in which the offense was committed can be 

a mitigating circumstance, if it is categorically less culpable 

than other cases of the same offense in a way the Legislature 

14 

 
did not necessarily anticipate.  See State v. Alexander, 125 

Wn.2d 717, 726–27, 888 P.2d 1169 (1995).  In Alexander, the 

Supreme Court considered whether the delivery of only an 

“extraordinarily small amount” of cocaine could support a 

mitigated exceptional sentence for delivery of a controlled 

substance.  Id.  “[T]he Legislature did not necessarily 

consider” this factor, the Court reasoned, because the precise 

amount of drugs delivered is neither an element of the offense 

nor a fact considered in computing the standard range.  Id. at 

726–27.  And the small amount of cocaine—less than one-

tenth of a gram—was distinct enough to separate the 

defendant’s offense from other instances of delivery of a 

controlled substance.  Id. at 727.  The Court found that the 

defendant’s “low level of involvement” in the transaction was 

also a mitigating factor for similar reasons.  Id. at 728–29.  

The “glorified shoplifting” version of second-degree 

robbery Mr. Thomason was convicted of here satisfies both 

parts of the test.  As relevant here, the Legislature defines 

“robbery” as taking property from the presence of another 

15 

 
against their will, using or threatening force to “obtain or 

retain possession of the property.”  RCW 9A.56.190; see RCW 

9A.56.210(1) (“A person is guilty of robbery in the second 

degree if he or she commits robbery.”).  In short, robbery 

consists of both “a property crime and a crime against the 

person,” State v. Nelson, 191 Wn.2d 61, 76, 419 P.3d 410 

(2018) (quoting State v. Tvedt, 153 Wn.2d 705, 711, 107 P.3d 

728 (2005)), without specifying any particular relationship in 

time or place between the taking and the use of force. 

As proven to the jury, Mr. Thomason’s “property crime” 

and “crime against the person” occurred at different times 

and in different places—taking $14.98 of merchandise inside 

the store, and later striking the security guard who accosted 

him outside the store.  RP 125–27, 129–32, 1/23/20 RP 12.  In 

fact, as Mr. Swartz was in plain clothes posing as a customer, 

Mr. Thomason likely did not know anyone was watching him 

inside the store and did not expect to use any degree of force 

before Mr. Swartz grabbed him outside.  RP 123, 125. 

16 

 
If charged separately, these two acts would amount to 

third-degree theft, see RCW 9A.56.050(1) (theft of items 

worth less than $750), and fourth-degree assault, see RCW 

9A.36.041(1) (assault without any of the criteria for superior 

degrees or custodial assault).  Both offenses are gross 

misdemeanors in the circumstances of this case, RCW 

9A.36.041(2); RCW 9A.56.050(2), and, if sentenced 

concurrently, the highest sentence Mr. Thomason would face 

would be the 12 months he asked for, RCW 9.92.020.   

The Legislature did not necessarily consider the 

possibility that its definition of robbery would transform these 

two otherwise distinct misdemeanors, committed at different 

times, into the class B felony of second-degree robbery.  RCW 

9A.56.210(2); see Alexander, 125 Wn.2d at 724–25 (“not all 

exceptional fact patterns can be anticipated” (quoting State v. 

McAlpin, 108 Wn.2d 458, 465, 740 P.2d 824 (1987))).  Nor 

does any provision of the SRA necessarily account for the 

degree of separation in time and place between the property 

and person aspects of the robbery, the “extraordinarily” low 

17 

 
value of food items taken, or the poverty of the taker.  

Alexander, 125 Wn.2d at 726–27; see RCW 9.94A.525(8) (how 

to calculate offender score for a violent offense); RCW 

9.94A.030(55)(xi) (second-degree robbery is a violent offense); 

RCW 9.94A.515 (seriousness level of IV); RCW 9.94A.510 

(sentencing grid).  The first part of the test as therefore met. 

The second part is met for much the same reason—a 

low-value shoplifting and a later struggle with security 

personnel are not “characteristic[s] inherent” in all cases of 

second-degree robbery.  Alexander, 125 Wn.2d at 729.  The 

separation in time and place between the two aspects of the 

robbery, as well as the “extraordinarily” low value of the 

merchandise taken, “therefore distinguish[ Mr. Thomason’s] 

crime from others in the same category.”  Id. at 727.  Mr. 

Thomason’s indigency, and the fact that he was alleged to 

have stolen only food items, are further distinguishing 

characteristics.  RP 125; 1/23/20 RP 12. 

Because the nature of Mr. Thomason’s offense 

conduct—a low-value shoplifting combined with a later 

18 

 
struggle with a security guard—satisfies the two-part test, it 

is a valid mitigating circumstance under the SRA.  O’Dell, 

183 Wn.2d at 690.  Accordingly, the trial court had discretion 

to consider whether, in light of the purposes of the SRA, the 

circumstances of the offense warranted an exceptional 

sentence.  RCW 9.94A.535. 

b.  The trial court’s standard-range sentence was an 
abuse of discretion where the court erroneously 
believed it could not depart downward. 

A trial court abuses its discretion “when it operates 

under the ‘mistaken belief that it did not have the discretion 

to impose a mitigated exceptional sentence for which [a 

defendant] may have been eligible.”  McFarland, 189 Wn.2d 

at 56–59 (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Garcia-

Martinez, 88 Wn. App. 322, 330, 944 P.2d 1104 (1997)).  This 

is so whether or not trial counsel requested an exceptional 

sentence or pointed out the trial court’s authority to do so.  Id. 

at 57–58.  “[A]n erroneous sentence, imposed without due 

consideration of an authorized mitigated sentence, constitutes 

a ‘fundamental defect’ resulting in a miscarriage of justice.”  

19 

 
Id. at 58 (quoting In re Pers. Restraint of Mulholland, 161 

Wn.2d 322, 332, 166 P.3d 677 (2007)). 

Accordingly, remand for resentencing is required when 

a trial court imposes a standard-range sentence despite 

expressing an inclination to depart downward, in the 

erroneous belief that it lacked discretion to do so.  Id. at 58–

59; McGill, 112 Wn. App. at 100–01.  In McGill, the trial court 

had discretion to depart downward from the standard range 

for the defendant’s multiple controlled substance offenses if it 

found that “the multiple offense policy of the SRA” would lead 

to a “clearly excessive” sentence.  112 Wn. App. at 99 & n.4 

(citing RCW 9.94A.535(1)(g)).  The court evidently did not 

know this, however, noting at sentencing that “the legislature 

has decided that judges should not have discretion beyond a 

certain sentencing range” and it had “no option” but to impose 

a standard range sentence of 87 to 116 months.  Id. at 98–99 

(emphasis omitted).  The court also expressed discomfort with 

the length of a standard-range sentence, noting “it doesn’t 

seem to be justified” for mere “drug cases.”  Id. 

20 

 
This Court held that the trial court erred in imposing a 

standard-range sentence without considering whether to 

impose an exceptional sentence.  Id. at 100–01.  Because of its 

erroneous belief that it lacked discretion to depart downward, 

the court effectively “refused to exercise its discretion” at all.  

Id. at 100.  And because the court’s comments at sentencing 

suggested “it would have considered an exceptional sentence 

had it known it could,” this Court remanded to give it the 

opportunity to do so.  Id. at 100–01; see also Mulholland, 161 

Wn.2d at 333–34 (remanding where trial court expressed 

sympathy for defendant but believed it lacked discretion); 

State v. Bunker, 144 Wn. App. 407, 411, 421–22, 183 P.3d 

1086 (2008) (remanding where trial court erroneously stated 

it lacked discretion to depart downward, but “would probably 

do it” if it could). 

The trial court here had discretion to depart downward 

because it could consider the unique combination of a theft of 

low-value food items and use of relatively minor force during 

a later confrontation with security as a mitigating factor.  See 

21 

 
supra at 14–19.  Nevertheless, the court incorrectly remarked 

that “[t]he only discretion I have is the time period between 

63 and 84 months.  That’s all I’ve got.”  1/23/20 RP 10.  The 

court also expressed discomfort with even a low-end sentence, 

saying “I don’t like” the charge of robbery in a case of 

“glorified shoplifting” and “I wish I had more” discretion than 

to choose within the standard range.  Id. at 10.  As in McGill, 

the court’s failure to exercise its discretion in the mistaken 

belief it did not have it was an abuse of discretion warranting 

remand.  112 Wn. App. at 100–01; accord McFarland, 189 

Wn.2d at 58–59; Bunker, 144 Wn. App. at 421–22. 

2.  Trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing 
to object to police officers’ pervasive and prejudicial 
inadmissible testimony. 

The Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 of the 

Washington State Constitution guarantee not merely the 

assistance of counsel, but the effective assistance of counsel. 

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 

80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); State v. Hendrickson, 129 Wn.2d 61, 

77, 917 P.2d 563 (1996). Ineffective assistance requires 

22 

 
reversal where (1) “defense counsel’s conduct . . . fell below an 

objective standard of reasonableness,” and (2) “the deficient 

performance resulted in prejudice.” State v. Reichenbach, 153 

Wn.2d 126, 130, 101 P.3d 80 (2004). 

a.  Counsel rendered deficient performance in choosing 
to raise no objection to police officers’ propensity 
evidence, violation of the best evidence rule, 
improper opinion, and rampant hearsay. 

Courts generally presume reasonable performance, and 

will not find deficient performance where counsel’s conduct 

amounted to “legitimate trial strategy or tactics.” State v. 

Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 33, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011) (quoting State 

v. Kyllo, 166 Wn.2d 856, 863, 215 P.3d 177 (2009)). The 

presumption is rebutted where “no conceivable legitimate 

tactic” can “explain[] counsel’s performance.” Reichenbach, 

153 Wn.2d at 130 (citing State v. Aho, 137 Wn.2d 736, 745–

46, 975 P.2d 512 (1999)). For example, “counsel performs 

deficiently by failing to object to inadmissible evidence absent 

a valid strategic reason.” State v. Crow, 8 Wn. App. 2d 480, 

508, 438 P.3d 541 (2019) (citing State v. Saunders, 91 Wn. 

App. 575, 578, 958 P.2d 364 (1998)).  

23 

 
In Hendrickson, the State introduced evidence of the 

defendant’s prior drug convictions.  129 Wn.2d at 77.  Though 

the prior convictions were irrelevant to the State’s case and 

inadmissible under ER 609, counsel did not object.  Id. at 78.  

The Supreme Court rejected the State’s argument that failure 

to object to this “damaging and prejudicial evidence” was a 

tactical choice—nothing in the defendant’s testimony or 

counsel’s argument suggested any reliance on the prior drug 

convictions.  Id. at 78–79; see also Saunders, 91 Wn. App.  at 

579–80 (failure to object is deficient performance where prior 

conviction was inadmissible under ER 609). 

Here, trial counsel failed to object to multiple instances 

of inadmissible evidence.  In the most egregious example, the 

State asked Officer Van Tassel whether he recognized Mr. 

Thomason in the surveillance video Kathy, Mr. Thomason’s 

mother, showed him.  RP 169.  The officer said he did not 

recognize Mr. Thomason while watching the video, but later 

saw him in “[p]hotographs that we have through our system, 

our computer system.”  RP 169.  In other words, Officer Van 

24 

 
Tassel saw multiple mug shots of Mr. Thomason in the 

Spokane Police Department’s database.  RP 169. 

By making clear to the jury the police department had 

Mr. Thomason’s “photograph ‘on hand,’” Officer Van Tassel’s 

testimony implied Mr. Thomason “had previously been 

arrested or convicted on another charge” in violation of ER 

404.  State v. Henderson, 100 Wn. App. 794, 803, 998 P.2d 

907 (2000).  As a result, Van Tassel’s testimony raised a 

“prejudicial inference of criminal propensity.”  State v. 

Sanford, 128 Wn. App. 280, 286–87, 115 P.3d 368 (2005).  Yet 

trial counsel failed to object to this inadmissible and highly 

prejudicial statement.  RP 169. 

Relatedly, Officer Van Tassel’s testimony describing the 

contents of Kathy’s surveillance video violated the best 

evidence rule.  Under this rule, a party may “prove the 

content of a . . . recording” only by way of the recording itself, 

unless the original was “lost” or “destroyed.”  ER 1002, 

1004(a).  “By far the most common means of proving loss or 

destruction” of an original is “a diligent but unsuccessful 

25 

 
search.”  United States v. McGaughey, 977 F.2d 1067, 1071 

(7th Cir. 1992) (alteration omitted) (quoting 5 Weinstein’s 

Evidence ¶ 1004(1)[05] at 1004–18 (1983)).4 

In State v. Nelson, No. 76354-5-I, 2018 WL 4697269 

(Wash. App. Oct. 1, 2018) (unpub.), a police officer “assumed” 

he would not be able to obtain a copy of surveillance video, 

but made no effort to do so.  Id. at *3; see GR 14.1(a).  

“Because the State made no showing that the original was 

lost or destroyed,” the officer’s testimony describing the 

“contents of the surveillance video” was inadmissible.  Id. 

As in Nelson, Officer Van Tassel made no attempt to 

retrieve Kathy Thomason’s surveillance footage—in fact, he 

admitted he “probably should have grabbed it.”  RP 171.  

Officer Groom testified the police “were not able to get a copy” 

of the footage, RP 184, but the State’s evidence shows this to 

be false—the Yoke’s footage was obtained by video recording 

4 Courts “may look to federal case law” analyzing 
federal evidence rules that “mirror” Washington’s.  In re Det. 
of Pouncy, 168 Wn.2d 382, 392 n.9, 229 P.3d 678 (2010); 
compare ER 1004 with Fed. R. Evid. 1004. 

26 

 
                                                
it in real time as it played on a computer screen, Ex. P-22, 

and Officer Van Tassel said he could have recorded Kathy’s 

footage with a body camera, RP 171.  His testimony 

describing the contents of the video therefore violated the best 

evidence rule.  RP 168–69; Nelson, 2018 WL 4697269.  Yet, 

again, counsel raised no objection.  RP 168–69.  

Unlike Kathy’s video, the State played surveillance 

footage from Yoke’s during the trial.  RP 141–50; Ex. P-22.  

Officer Groom testified he reviewed the footage when he 

visited the store and spoke with Mr. Swartz.  RP 176, 178.  

This video was Officer Groom’s only opportunity to see what 

Mr. Thomason looks like—like the jury, he saw Mr. 

Thomason in person for the first time at trial.  RP 11, 184.  

Yet the State asked Officer Groom to identify Mr. Thomason 

from the witness stand.  RP 184–85. 

Because Officer Groom was in no better position to 

identify Mr. Thomason from the surveillance video than the 

jury, his in-court identification was an improper opinion on 

guilt.  State v. George, 150 Wn. App. 110, 119, 206 P.3d 697 

27 

 
(2009); United States v. LaPierre, 998 F.2d 1460, 1465 (9th 

Cir. 1993).  Counsel did not object to this inadmissible 

testimony either.  RP 184–85. 

Lastly, both police officers’ testimony was rife with 

inadmissible hearsay.  Officer Van Tassel testified Mr. Swartz 

told him he saw Mr. Thomason go into a house, and parroted 

Mr. Swartz’s account of being assaulted at the store.  RP 163–

64, 167.  The officer also related Kathy’s statements that Mr. 

Swartz’s description of the suspect sounded like Mr. 

Thomason, and that he was the man shown in her 

surveillance video.  RP 167–69.  Likewise, Officer Groom 

recalled Mr. Swartz’s narrative of what had happened at 

Yoke’s.  RP 177–78.  Had defense counsel objected to these 

statements, the State would have had to prove either they 

were not hearsay or a hearsay exception applied.  See State v. 

Starbuck, 189 Wn. App. 740, 752, 355 P.3d 1167 (2015) 

(proponent of evidence must prove admissibility). 

Prosecutors often attempt to argue that out-of-court 

statements to a police officer are offered, not for their truth, 

28 

 
but to show the officer’s state of mind.  E.g., State v. Johnson, 

61 Wn. App. 539, 545, 811 P.2d 687 (1991).  But out-of-court 

statements are admissible for this purpose only where the 

officer’s “state of mind is relevant to a material issue in the 

case.”  Id.  Here, there was no reason for the officers to relate 

Mr. Swartz’s and Kathy Thomason’s statements except to 

improperly bolster their credibility.  The out-of-court 

statements were therefore inadmissible hearsay.  Id.  And 

counsel raised no objection to any of them.  RP 163–64, 167–

69, 177–78. 

The damage the two officers’ inadmissible testimony 

did to Mr. Thomason’s case was substantial.  Juries tend to 

imbue officers’ statements with “a special aura of reliability.”  

State v. Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d 918, 928–29, 155 P.3d 125 

(2007).  By referring to Mr. Thomason’s multiple mug shots, 

describing the contents of Kathy’s unproduced surveillance 

video, and identifying Mr. Thomason from the witness stand, 

the officers invited the jurors to discard any doubts they 

might have and rely on the officers’ presumed expertise 

29 

 
instead.  By reciting Kathy’s and Mr. Swartz’s statements, 

the officers implicitly endorsed their testimony, buttressing 

their credibility. 

Counsel may have had a tactical reason for declining to 

object to one or two of these pieces of inadmissible evidence 

individually—say, to avoid “emphasizing” them.  In re Pers. 

Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 714, 101 P.3d 1 (2004).  

Where counsel raised no objection to any of the inadmissible 

testimony—or to any part of the State’s presentation of 

evidence, at any time—a strategic purpose becomes all but 

impossible to imagine.  Nor did trial counsel make any use of 

the testimony for his own ends—he reserved opening, and did 

not touch on the officers’ testimony at all during closing.  RP 

110, 210–12; Hendrickson, 129 Wn.2d at 79.  “[N]o 

conceivable legitimate tactic” explains counsel’s choice not to 

raise a single objection to any of this “damaging and 

prejudicial evidence.”  Reichenbach, 153 Wn.2d at 130; 

Hendrickson, 129 Wn.2d at 78–79. 

30 

 
b.  The unchallenged, inadmissible testimony caused 
sufficient prejudice to undermine trust in the 
outcome. 

Prejudice results where there is a “‘reasonable 

probability’ that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the 

result of the proceeding would have been different.”  Crow, 8 

Wn. App. 2d at 511.  That is the case here. 

The State’s case against Mr. Thomason was far from 

airtight.  To prove him guilty of second-degree robbery, it 

needed to show he took merchandise from the store and used 

force to retain it—in other words, he still had the food when 

Mr. Swartz accosted him outside.  RP 203–04; CP 59; RCW 

9A.56.190.  The State’s only evidence on this score was Mr. 

Swartz’s testimony that he saw Mr. Thomason take food out 

of two display cases and conceal the items in his clothing.  RP 

125–27.  The State presented no direct evidence Mr. 

Thomason left the store with any unpaid-for merchandise in 

his possession—no stolen food was ever recovered, and no food 

items came loose from Mr. Thomason’s clothing during his 

altercation with Mr. Swartz.  RP 149–50, 158; Ex. P-22. 

31 

 
The jury had reason to doubt Mr. Swartz’s opportunity 

to observe Mr. Thomason’s conduct, at least at the time Mr. 

Thomason is supposed to have concealed the food.  Rather 

than maintaining direct line-of-sight with Mr. Thomason, Mr. 

Swartz recalled walking down a separate aisle, peering 

toward Mr. Thomason from behind displays or watching his 

reflection in a cooler door.  RP 126–27, 145–46.  The 

surveillance video confirms that an entire grocery aisle lay 

between Mr. Thomason and Mr. Swartz, calling into doubt 

whether Mr. Swartz was able to clearly see Mr. Thomason 

hide the items in his clothes.  Ex. P-22, at IMG_0168.MOV. 

Moreover, at each of the moments Mr. Swartz said Mr. 

Thomason took or concealed merchandise, the action took 

place either out of frame or behind an obstruction.  RP 144–

46; Ex. P-22 at IMG_0167.MOV, IMG_0168.MOV.  Mr. 

Swartz’s inferior opportunity to observe and the unreliability 

of the surveillance footage left room for at least one juror to 

harbor a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. Thomason still 

32 

 
had the food when he walked out of the store, and therefore 

whether he committed robbery. 

 It is impossible to know whether the jury weighed 

these weaknesses in the State’s case and concluded they 

nonetheless did not create a reasonable doubt, or disregarded 

them in favor of the “special aura of reliability” projected by 

the police officers’ unchallenged, improper testimony.  

Kirkman, 159 Wn.2d at 928–29.  Accordingly, there is a 

reasonable probability that, had counsel not failed to object, 

the jury may have returned a different verdict.  Crow, 8 Wn. 

App. 2d at 511; Saunders, 91 Wn. App. at 581.  The conviction 

of second-degree robbery must be reversed. 

3.  The trial court erred in imposing a crime-related 
prohibition in excess of the statutory maximum 
sentence. 

A trial court may impose “crime-related prohibitions” as 

part of a sentence.  RCW 9.94A.505(9).  This includes the 

power to impose no-contact orders.  State v. Armendariz, 160 

Wn.2d 106, 118, 156 P.3d 201 (2007).  The effective term of a 

crime-related prohibition, however, may not exceed the 

33 

 
statutory maximum sentence for the offense of conviction.  Id. 

at 119–20. 

As a class B felony, second-degree robbery carries a 

statutory maximum sentence of ten years.  RCW 

9A.20.021(1)(b); RCW 9A.56.210(2).  Accordingly, the trial 

court here was not authorized to impose crime-related 

prohibitions with a term greater than ten years.  Armendariz, 

160 Wn.2d at 119–20.  Nonetheless, the court included a 

lifetime no-contact order in the judgment and sentence.  CP 

108.  This Court should remand with instructions to strike 

the no-contact order and hold a new hearing on the term of 

any no-contact order to be imposed. 

4.  The trial court erred in imposing discretionary legal 
financial obligations despite finding Mr. Thomason 
indigent. 

Courts may not impose discretionary legal financial 

obligations on defendants who have been found indigent. 

RCW 10.01.160(3); State v. Ramirez, 191 Wn.2d 732, 748, 426 

P.3d 714 (2018).  Supervision fees as a condition of 

community custody are a discretionary legal financial 

34 

 
obligation because they “are waivable by the trial court.”  

State v. Dillon, 12 Wn. App. 2d 133, 152, 456 P.3d 1199 

(2020); accord State v. Lundstrom, 6 Wn. App. 2d 388, 396 

n.3, 429 P.3d 1116 (2018).  Imposing supervision fees on an 

indigent defendant is an error requiring remand.  Dillon, 12 

Wn. App. 2d at 152–53.  In addition, where the trial court 

makes clear on the record its intent to waive all discretionary 

fees and costs yet inadvertently fails to strike a boilerplate 

obligation to pay supervision fees, remand is warranted to 

correct the court’s scrivener’s error.  Id. at 152.  

Here, the trial court found Mr. Thomason indigent.  

1/23/20 RP 12.  It waived the discretionary $200 filing fee and 

remarked it would “prefer to waive” the $500 victim penalty 

assessment, indicating its intent to impose only mandatory 

legal financial obligations.  1/23/20 RP 12.  Nonetheless, 

boilerplate language in the judgment and sentence included 

as a condition of community custody that Mr. Thomason “pay 

supervision fees.”  CP 105.  This Court should remand with 

35 

 
instructions to strike the obligation to pay supervision fees.  

Dillon, 12 Wn. App. 2d at 152–53. 

F.  CONCLUSION 

This Court should vacate Mr. Thomason’s sentence and 

remand for a new sentencing hearing.  For independent 

reasons, this court should reverse Mr. Thomason’s conviction 

and remand for a new trial.  Alternatively, this Court should 

remand with instructions to strike from the judgment and 

sentence the lifetime no-contact order in favor of Mr. Swartz 

and the obligation to pay supervision fees.
