John A. Gibney, Jr., District Judge. (3:20-cv-00298-JAG-RCY)\n\n\nSubmitted: September 9, 2021                                Decided: September 14, 2021\n\n\nBefore MOTZ, KING, and WYNN, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nDismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\n\nJames Henry Simpson, Appellant Pro Se.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       James Henry Simpson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge\n\nissues a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A certificate of\n\nappealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a\n\nprisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists could find the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. See Buck v.\n\nDavis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773-74 (2017). When the district court denies relief on procedural\n\ngrounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is\n\ndebatable and that the petition states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140-41 (2012) (citing Slack v. McDaniel, 529\n\nU.S. 473, 484 (2000)).\n\n       Limiting our review of the record to the issues raised in Simpson\u2019s informal brief,\n\nwe conclude that Simpson has not made the requisite showing. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b); see\n\nalso Jackson v. Lightsey, 775 F.3d 170, 177 (4th Cir. 2014) (\u201cThe informal brief is an\n\nimportant document; under Fourth Circuit rules, our review is limited to issues preserved\n\nin that brief.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.\n\n       We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\n\nadequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the\n\ndecisional process.\n\n                                                                               DISMISSED\n\n                                             2\n\f",
