CRITICAL FIX: Add canonical name validation to proximity override

Root Cause:
The proximity override was blindly trusting that ANY citations within 200 
characters must be parallel citations, even if they were from different cases.

Example Bug:
When a document listed multiple authorities in a footnote:
- "Johnson v. McIntosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 5 L. Ed. 681"
- "Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L. Ed. 483"

These were grouped into ONE cluster (4 citations) instead of TWO clusters 
(2 parallel citations each) because they appeared close together.

The Fix:
Added canonical name checking to the proximity override logic:
1. If citations are within 200 chars AND have matching canonical names → valid parallel
2. If citations are within 200 chars BUT have different canonical names → different cases!
   - Apply P5_FIX validation to split them properly

Expected Result:
- Johnson v. McIntosh cluster: 8 Wheat. 543 + 5 L. Ed. 681 ✅
- Worcester v. Georgia cluster: 6 Pet. 515 + 8 L. Ed. 483 ✅
- Martin v. Waddell cluster: 16 Pet. 367 + 10 L. Ed. 997 ✅
- Rogers cluster: 4 How. 567 + 11 L. Ed. 1105 ✅

This fixes incorrect clustering when multiple authorities are cited together.
