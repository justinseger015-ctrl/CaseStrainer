I.  INTRODUCTION  
Amici Curie of the National Police Accountability Project 
(“NPAP”) writes separately to inform this Court of what it 
already knows: disclosure of the identities of police officers 
having been found to have committed misconduct is of legitimate 
concern to the public.  See Brouillet v. Cowles Pub. Co., 114 
Wn.2d 788, 798, 791 P.2d 526, 532 (1990) (observing 
substantiated allegations of sexual misconduct are of public 
concern “because the public must decide what can be done about 
it” but noting there may not be legitimate public interest in names 
of students).  However, as this Court is aware from other filings 
in this matter, the identities of the two officers having been found 
to have committed misconduct on January 6, 2021 have, indeed, 
been disclosed.1  
So, too, has the entire substance of the underlying 
investigation conducted by the Office of Police Accountability

(“OPA”).  The only issue remaining on this appeal is whether the 
Public Record Act (“PRA”) likely mandates disclosure of the 
identities of the four Seattle police officers (“Represented 
Officers”) who were cleared of any involvement in the 
insurrection in the OPA Closed Case Summary (“OPA 
Summary”).  
The NPAP brings nothing to the table concerning that core 
issue.  Rather, and without so much as citing to the PRA or the 
case law interpreting the privacy rubric of RCW 42.56.050, the 
NPAP argues that disclosure of the identities of “insurrectionist 
officers” who run “roughshod over constitutional norms” serves 
the public interest.  Lacking from its analysis is whether the 
public interest is served in any way by disclosure of the identities 
of officers caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated 
concerns over being an “insurrectionist officer.”   
Indeed, the NPAP’s strident characterization of these four 
Represented Officers, after having been cleared by OPA, as 
“insurrectionist officers” underscores the inevitable exposure to 

--- Page 6 ---
-3- 
“hatred and ridicule, in the community, without any evidence 
that such misconduct ever occurred,” that these Represented 
Officers will suffer as a result of disclosure of their identities.  
Bellevue John Does 1-11 v. Bellevue Sch. Dist. #405, 164 Wn.2d 
199, 215, 189 P.3d 139, 148 (2008).  The Represented Officer’s 
legitimate concerns over a public rush to judgment, without so 
much as considering the OPA’s written findings, are certainly 
borne out in the NPAP Amici Brief, where even the drafting 
attorneys either failed to read the OPA Summary (or deliberately 
disregard its conclusions) before maligning the Represented 
Officers as “insurrectionist officers” in a public filing.  See Amici 
Br. at p. 2 (“At least six Seattle Police officers participated in an 
insurrection at the United States Capital on January 6th 2021); see 
also pp. 6-8 (repeated references to “insurrectionist officers”).  
Or in the case of the closely affiliated2 National Lawyers Guild, 
demonize them as “white supremacist–affiliated officers” having

National Lawyers Guild”).

infiltrated law enforcement based solely on their presence at a 
lawful political rally.  See Amici Br. of Nat. Lawyers Guild.      
Because the NPAP’s brief does not address the relevant 
issue, assumes that the Represented Officers are so called 
“insurrectionist officers” despite being cleared by OPA, and 
indeed, makes no tenable argument for the public disclosure of 
the identities of police officers acquitted of misconduct, the 
NPAP offers little, if anything, to the relevant discussion.   
II. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE  
 
 
The Represented Officers hereby reincorporate the facts 
contained in their Supplemental Brief filed on September 30, 
2021, pp. 2-5.   
III.   DISCLOSURE OF THE IDENTITIES OF THE 
FOUR REPRESENTED OFFICERS CLEARED OF ANY 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE INSURRECTION IS NOT OF 
LEGITIMATE CONCERN TO THE PUBLIC   
 
Although not explicitly stated in its Amici Brief, the 
NPAP appears to be arguing that disclosure of the identities of 
“insurrectionist police officers” is of legitimate concern to the 

--- Page 8 ---
-5- 
public within the meaning of RCW 42.56.050.  And, with respect 
to the two Seattle Police Officers having actually criminally 
trespassed during the insurrection, this is true.  However, the 
specific identities of the Represented Officers caught up in an 
investigation 
into 
unsubstantiated 
concerns 
over 
their 
involvement are not of “legitimate concern” to the public.  And 
the NPAP makes no argument to the contrary.   
The NPAP emphasizes the involvement of its membership 
in “litigat[ing] the thousands of egregious cases of law 
enforcement abuse.”  See Amici Br. of NPAP at p. 1.  Like its 
stated mission, its Brief demonstrates a concerted effort to 
“litigate a case of law enforcement abuse” here.  The problem is 
the relevant and substantiated facts do not rise anywhere near the 
level of law enforcement abuse.  Instead, these facts demonstrate 
nothing more than constitutionally protected lawful off duty 
political activities of the four Represented Officers.  See 9/30/21 
Represented Officers’ Supp Br. at p. 4.  It is undisputed, after a 
comprehensive administrative investigation, these Represented 

--- Page 9 ---
-6- 
Officers were cleared of any involvement in the January 6th 
insurrection.  And, despite obvious public concern over the 
violation of Constitutional rights by police officers, there is 
nothing here remotely indicating that such concerns are 
implicated by the actions of the four Represented Officers.   
Yet, the thrust of the NPAP’s Amici Brief, and the 
authorities cited therein, focus on substantiated allegations of on 
duty police officer misconduct directed toward arrestees and/or 
suspects, and public interest in disclosure of those circumstances.  
In calling for the release of the “associated details about 
misconduct” it outright ignores the most salient fact – the OPA 
Summary, which contains all those details, has already been 
released.  The transparency which fosters both public trust and 
police accountability is well preserved by disclosure of the 
substance of the investigation including its methodology, 
resulting factual determinations, and the rationale substantiating 
the ultimate conclusions. 

--- Page 10 ---

Disclosure of the identities of public servants, including 
police officers who are the subject of unsubstantiated allegations 
“serve[s] no interest other than gossip and sensation.”  Id. at 221 
(internal quotes omitted); Bainbridge Island Police Guild v. City 
of Puyallup, 172 Wn.2d 398, 415, 259 P.3d 190, 198 (2011) 
(observing “no reason to distinguish an allegation of sexual 
misconduct against a police officer from an allegation of sexual 
misconduct against a teacher”).  “The identity of the accused ... 
is unnecessary, and plays little role in the public’s oversight of 
the investigation.”  Bellevue John Does, 164 Wn.2d at 220, 189 
P.3d at 150 (emphasis original).  “The name is most relevant to 
public oversight if the misconduct occurred—if the misconduct 
didn’t occur, the only actual governmental action is the 
investigation.”  Id. (citation omitted) (emphasis original).  In 
short, the identities of police officers do not aid the public in 
overseeing the government’s response to unsubstantiated 
allegations.  Nor do they facilitate the investigative process.

Because the NLPA makes no argument as to how the 
identities of public employees caught up in an investigation into 
unsubstantiated allegation is of legitimate concern to the public, 
an analysis of its brief should end there.   
IV.  CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Represented Officers 
respectfully request that this Court reverse the trial court’s order 
denying their request for a preliminary injunction, and remand 
with instructions to the trial court to enjoin production of the 
Represented Officers names or identities.

document exempted from the word count by RAP 18.17(b).
