Ill. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
The Defendant was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the 
First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a 
Controlled Substance (Heroin), and Possession of Drug 
Paraphernalia. See State v. Justin C. Lewis, 35775-9-111, 2019 WL 
1568058 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019)(Unpublished).1 The underlying 
facts of the case are immaterial and warrant no discussion. 
The Defendant was represented by attorney Robert Van 
ldour throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order 
(04/05/17) (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint 
Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). At the time, Mr. 
Van I dour was a licensed member of the Idaho State Bar 
Association, in good standing, and was assigned to provide public 
defense, on contract under APR 8(c). Declaration of Robert J. Van 
ldour (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint 
Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour 
had contracted with Asotin County and had arranged to practice 
under APR B(c), which authorizes attorneys who are licensed by 
other states to appear for the purposes of public defense while they 
apply for a formal license to practice in Washington. Declaration of 
1 The State does not cite the unpublished decision for 
precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual 
background of the case.

--- Page 7 ---
Robert J. Van ldour, Declaration of Vivian Bly, (see attached 
State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached 
documents, attached hereto). Prior to contracting with Mr. Van 
!dour, the Board of County Commissioners inquired of the Superior 
Court Judge, Scott Gallina, regarding Mr. Van ldour's qualifications 
to contract for public defense without being licensed in 
Washington. Declaration of Vivian Bly. Judge Gallina confirmed 
that Mr. Van ldour would be eligible through APR 8(c) process to 
perform duties under a contract while he applied for admission to 
the Washington State Bar. Throughout the process, the Superior 
Court Administrator made periodic efforts to contact the 
Washington State Bar Association to confirm that Mr. Van ldour's 
application was pending and processing. Declaration of Tammy 
Tenny,(see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint 
Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). On October 26, 
2017, the Court was notified via email that Mr. Van ldour's 
application for admission had been approved. Declaration of 
Tammy Tenny. 
In October of 2017, Mr. Van ldour indicated he needed a 
formal order from the Court which was provided, memorializing his 
acceptance by the Court as indigent defense counsel dated 
October 6, 2017, nunc pro tune to February 1, 2017. Declaration of 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 8 ---
Tammy Tenny. Not until January 31, 2018, did the Court receive 
any information that there was any problem with Mr. Van ldour's 
application to practice under APR 8(c).2 The Court immediately 
instructed Mr. Van ldour to arrange to transfer his cases to other 
attorneys. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Subsequently, the Court 
received a letter dated February 13, 2018, indicating Mr. Van ldour 
was not authorized to practice in Washington courts. Declaration of 
Tammy Tenny. 
The Defendant, who was convicted on October 31, 2017 
and sentenced on November 7, 2017, appealed his conviction, 
and it was affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. 
See State v. Lewis, supra. The Defendant then filed this personal 
restraint petition, alleging only that he had been deprived of his 
right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was 
not licensed to practice in Washington. The Defendant neither 
argued nor demonstrated that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of 
misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor did he otherwise claim any 
prejudice therefrom. In an unpublished decision, the Division Three 
of the Court of Appeals dismissed the Defendant's PRP, finding 
2 For what it's worth, the Asotin County Prosecutor's office 
did not become aware of any irregularities concerning Mr. Van 
ldour's eligibility to represent indigent defendants until the Court 
assigned new counsel to Mr. Van ldour's cases in February of 
2018.

that 1) the Defendant failed to allege he was prejudiced by his 
attorney's representation and 2) the facts set forth in the 
Defendant's petition failed to establish that he should be excused 
from showing prejudice based on a theory of structural error. Matter 
of Lewis, 37284-7-111, 2021 WL 1750935 (Div. Ill, May 4, 2021) 
( unpublished). 3 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The decision to review a Court of Appeals decision 
terminating review is discretionary. RAP 13.4(a). A petition for 
review will be accepted by the Supreme Court only if at least one of 
four criteria are met. RAP 13.4(b); In re Coats, 173 Wn.2d 123, 
132-33 (2011 ). Two criteria relevant to this petition are a) the 
decision of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with a decision by the 
Supreme Court and b) the petition involves a substantial public 
interest that should be determined by the Supreme Court. Id. 
The Defendant argues that the Court of Appeals' decision 
conflicts with this Court's decision in City of Seattle v. Ratliff. 100 
Wn.2d 212 (1983). However, the Court of Appeals' decision here 
this Court's decision in Ratliff are based on a similar legal 
3The State does not cite the unpublished decision for 
precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual 
background of the case. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 10 ---
framework, with the difference in outcome dictated by the 
distinguishing facts of each case. Furthermore, because the 
decision in this petition does not change the right to counsel, it 
does not represent a matter of substantial public interest. 
I. 
THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DOES NOT 
CONFLICT WITH THIS COURT'S HOLDING IN CITY OF 
SEATTLE V. RA TL/FF BECAUSE THE FACTS OF THE 
DEFENDANT'S CASE ARE DISTINGUISHABLE IN THAT 
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT WAS LICENSED IN AT 
LEAST ONE JURISDICTION. 
Generally, a defendant challenging his conviction through a 
Personal Restraint Petition (PRP) must show that the error raised 
impacted the outcome of the trial. See, e.g., In re Personal 
Restraint of Crace, 174 Wn.2d 835 (2012); In re Pers. Restraint of 
Finstad, 177 Wn.2d 501, 506 (2013). If the defendant cannot show 
that they were prejudiced by the error, then their petition is 
dismissed. Crace, 174 Wn.2d 847-48. An exception to the 
prejudice requirement exists where there is a structural error, i.e. 
an error which impacts the framework of the trial process. Weaver 
v. Massachusetts, -
U.S.--, 137 S. Ct. 1899(2017). 
Both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution 
and article 1, section 22 of the state constitution guarantee the right 
to counsel in a criminal case. Const. amend VI; Const. art. 1, § 22; 
See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 672, 
101 P.3d 1 (2004). With regard to this right to counsel, the state 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
6 

--- Page 11 ---
constitution provides no more protection than the Sixth 
Amendment. State v. Medlock, 86 Wn.App. 89, 99, review denied, 
133 Wn.2d 1012 (1997). Absolute denial of counsel, such as when 
the "attorney" was not licensed in any state at the time of 
representation, does not require a showing of prejudice.4 See 
Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), affd, 2 
F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). 
However, lesser violations of the right to counsel do not 
require automatic dismissal. A defendant who is represented by a 
person who has been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction 
has not suffered from a per se Sixth Amendment violation. See, 
e.g.,United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2000) 
("We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se 
ineffectiveness rule beyond those cases in which a defendant is 
represented by a person never properly admitted to any bar.'); 
United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir. 1998) 
("the key to adequate representation is not technical license to 
practice in the jurisdiction involved, but a credential from some 
forum demonstrating the specialized knowledge of a lawyer.'). 
A defendant who was represented by a lawyer whose 
4See, e.g.,Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629-30 
(1993), citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

license has been suspended must demonstrate actual prejudice in 
order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., United States v. 
Watson, 479 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 2007) (suspension of a state 
license not per se ineffective assistance of counsel); Hardamon v. 
United States, 319 F.3d 943,951 (7th Cir. 2003) (suspension of an 
attorney does not amount to per se ineffective assistance); State v. 
Edison, 61 Wn. App. 530, 811 P.2d 958 (1991) (defendant must 
demonstrate actual prejudice when represented by a lawyer who 
has been licensed but whose license was suspended). 
A defendant Who was represented by an out-of-state 
attorney who has not been admitted pro hac vice must demonstrate 
actual prejudice in order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., 
Cole v. United States, 162 F.3d 957, 959 (7th Cir. 1998); Kieser v. 
New York, 56 F.3d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 1995) (lawyer suspended in New 
Jersey and not admitted pro hac vice in New York when case was 
tried); United States v. Costanzo, 740 F.2d 251, 258-59 (3d Cir. 
1984); Derringer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1141 (8th Cir. 
1971 ). 
These violations are considered less serious because they 
do not thwart the purposes of the right to counsel. As the Court of 
Appeals explained in Matter of Ayerst, 
The limited allowance for structural error is based on 
two considerations. "First, courts are concerned that a 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
8 

--- Page 13 ---
defendant have a counselor who has legal training 
and demonstrated the specialized knowledge and 
ability of a lawyer." Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 
916. This concern was emphasized in the 
Washington Supreme Court's decision in Ratliff, 
where the defendant was represented by a law 
student who operated outside the parameters of the 
admission to practice rules applicable to law students. 
100 Wash.2d at 217, 667 P.2d 630. Second, there is 
concern "an undisclosed lack of credentials may 
create a conflict of interest." Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 
at 916. This consideration is based on Judge 
Friendly's analysis in Solina. 
17 Wn.App.2d 356. 
Under these applicable standards, the Court of Appeals 
correctly determined that, while the Defendant had been deprived 
of counsel, the deprivation was not severe enough to constitute a 
structural error. Matter of Lewis, No. 37284-7-111, 2-3 (2021) 
(unpublished). As the Court noted, Mr. Van ldour "was and is an 
attorney, subject to state licensing regulations," and could have 
qualified to provide indigent defense representation in Washington 
[under APR 8]." Id. at 3. Thus, the Defendant was required to 
demonstrate prejudice and, because he failed to do so, the Court 
of Appeals dismissed his PRP. Id. 
The Court of Appeals decision neither conflicts with Ratliff 
nor undermines this Court's authority to regulate the practice of 
law. In Ratliff, this Court held that representation by a legal intern 
licensed under APR 9 ("rule 9 intern") who has been prevented 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
9 

--- Page 14 ---
from complying with that rule is a per se violation of the right to 
counsel. 100 Wn.2d at 221. There, the defendant was scheduled to 
be tried on three charges, but his court-appointed counsel did not 
appear on the morning of trial. Id. at 213. Upon questioning the 
defendant, the court learned that he was being represented by a 
rule 9 intern, who had not completed law school and who had 
never been licensed to practice law in Washington or any other 
jurisdiction, in a different.case. Id. at 213-14; see APR 9(8). 
Despite the fact that the rule 9 intern had no involvement with the 
matters set for trial, the court summoned him and, after allowing 
the him to speak with the defendant "U]ust a little bit," attempted to 
proceed with the trial. Id. at 214. When the intern objected, the. 
court required him over objection to proceed, but allowed the 
defense to delay the presentation of its case until the next business 
day. Id. at 214. The court did not allow the intern time to consult his 
supervising attorney prior to trial, as required by APR 9. Id. at 215, 
220; see APR 9(0). 
By the time that case reached this Court, two separate 
issues had been raised. The defendant argued that he was denied 
effective assistance of counsel because the intern was given 
insufficient time to prepare his case and was prevented from 
consulting his supervising attorney as required by APR 9. Id. at 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
10 

--- Page 15 ---
215. In addition, the Court of Appeals, sua sponte, questioned 
whether representation of an indigent defendant by a law student, 
without the presence of a supervising attorney in court, constituted 
a per se violation of the right to counsel. Id. 
This Court first addressed the constitutional challenge to 
representation by rule 9 interns. In doing so, it reminded the legal 
community that it has the constitutionally granted power to 
determine who may appear before the bar, and that this power is 
both "well established" and "involate." Id. at 215. Pursuant to this 
power, this Court promulgated and adopted the Admission to 
Practice Rules including APR 9, which allows "lesser qualified 
persons to engage in limited practice." Id. at 216. Next, this Court 
explained that rule 9 has several requirements, including 
completion of at least two-thirds of the prescribed study at an 
approved law school, maintenance of good academic standing, and 
supervision by a qualified licensed attorney. Id. Additionally, rule 9 
contains specific rules outlining the conditions under which an 
intern may try cases without a supervisor present. Id. Thus, this 
Court concluded, 
[a]lthough a legal intern is not an attorney, this court 
has established safeguards sufficient to assure that 
persons attaining rule 9 status will be competent to 
serve the needs of their clients. In light of this court's 
authority to determine which persons may practice in 
Washington state courts, and in light of the rules this 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
11 

--- Page 16 ---
court has promulgated to assure that persons so 
practicing are qualified, we have held that there is no 
per se impropriety in allowing legal interns to appear 
in criminal proceedings. We now hold that these 
same safeguards are sufficient to meet the 
constitutional requirements of counsel. 
Id. at 216-217.Ultimately, this Court concluded that when rule 9 is 
complied with, a criminal defendant receives legal assistance 
"sufficient to meet with both state and federal constitutions." Id. at 
218. 
This Court then turned to the facts of the defendant's case. 
Whereas a law student acting in compliance with rule 9 does 
qualify as counsel for sixth amendment purposes, this Court held, 
"representation by a law student intern who fails to comply with the 
conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an 
absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal." Id. 
at 19 (emphasis added), citing Cheatham v. State, 364 So.2d 83, 
84 {Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (failure to comply with requirements that 
supervising attorney be present and defendant be informed of 
student status); In re Moore, 63 III.App.3d 899, 904 (1978) (failure 
to inform court of student status and failure to obtain defendant's 
written consent); cf. People v. Masonis, 58 Mich.App. 615, 619 
(1975) (/aw student representation did not violate right to counsel 
where defendant was aware of student status, general effective 
assistance of counsel standards were met, and there was no 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
12 

--- Page 17 ---
violation of student practice rules). Additionally, the Court held that 
where counsel is outright denied, no prejudice need be shown. Id. 
at 220, citing People v. Felder,4 7 N.Y.2d 287, 294 (1979) 
( defendants were denied effective assistance of counsel where 
each defendant was represented in his underlying criminal action 
by a person who had not completed law school and who was not, 
and had never been, admitted to the Bar of the State or of any 
other jurisdiction). Because the record demonstrated that the law 
student representing the defendant was prevented from complying 
with the requirements of APR 9 which would have otherwise 
qualified him as counsel, this Court held that there was a denial of 
the "in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 213. 
The Court of Appeals decision in this case does not conflict 
with Ratliff because the holding of Ratliff is restricted to law 
students practicing under APR 9 or, at the very least, 
representation by individuals who have never completed law school 
or been licensed as an attorney in any jurisdiction. In Ratliff, the 
question before this Court was whether a rule 9 intern, who had 
never been admitted to practice in any jurisdiction, could ever 
qualify as counsel for constitutional purposes and, if so, the 
conditions required for doing so. This reading is supported by the 
cases cited by this Court in reaching its conclusions, a majority of 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
13 

--- Page 18 ---
which discuss the practice of law by student interns in other states. 
Furthermore, the Defendant's argument that the Court of 
Appeal's decision in his case interfere's with this Court's ability to 
regulate the practice of law in Washington state is misplaced. 
Ratliff's discussion of this Court's power to regulate the practice of 
law is oriented towards this Court's constitutional power to decide 
when an individual may affirmatively be admitted to practice in 
Washington state. It does not necessarily follow that, in every case 
where an individuaf is represented by counsel out of compliance 
with the APRs, there is an per se denial of counsel. Absent the 
requirements of rule 9, a legal intern is comparable to a lay person 
because they have never been licensed to practice law in any 
jurisdiction and, in many cases, have not yet completed their legal 
studies. By contrast, an attorney admissible pro hac vice under 
APR 8, while not licensed in Washington state, has completed their 
legal studies and qualified as an attorney in at least one 
jurisdiction. See APR 8(b).5 Even if that attorney were to later fail to 
comply with the requirements of APR 8, he would still have legal 
training and specialized knowledge necessary to ensure a fair trial. 
5The irony is inescapable that this issue has been raised in 
an era where this Court suspended the bar exam and admitted 
over 500 law school graduates under diploma privilege. See

BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 19 ---
The issue raised here is not whether Mr. Van !dour was admitted to 
practice in Washington, but rather what the remedy should be 
when he failed to comply with the APRs but had the legal 
knowledge and skills necessary to provide competent 
representation. 6 
Because the holding of Ratliff is so restricted, it fits within the 
same legal framework applied in Defendant's case. As discussed 
above, courts draw a distinction between deprivation of counsel 
claims where the defendant's representative is not qualified to 
practice law in any jurisdiction, and those where the representative 
is qualified to practice in at least one jurisdiction, but not the 
jurisdiction where the representation occurred. In Ratliff, the 
otherwise unlicensed law student intern was prevented from 
complying with the requirements of rule 9, and therefore was not 
qualified to practice in any jurisdiction. Thus, this Court 
appropriately declared the law student's representation a per se 
violation of the right to counsel. In the Petitoner's matter, the Court 
of Appeals correctly identified a distinguishing fact-that Mr. Van 
ldour, at the time of his representation, was qualified to practice in 
at least one jurisdiction- and appropriately required the Defendant 
6lt is worth noting that, outside the per se violation of the 
right to counsel argument, the Defendant does not argue that Mr. 
Van ldour's representation prejudiced him in any way.

to demonstrate prejudice. 
II. 
THE COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION DOES NOT 
REPRESENT A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST 
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT 
TO COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. 
As discussed above, the Court of Appeals merely applied 
. existing law to reach its decision in the Defendant's matter. 
Furthermore, it did so in a manner not inconsistent with this Court's 
holding in Ratliff. As such, the Court of Appeals decision does not 
alter the public's right to counsel. Because of this, the Defendant's 
case does not represent a matter of public interest and review on 
that ground should be denied. 
Ill. 
THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT DEFENDANT AND 
AMICUS'S CLAIMS THAT EITHER THE COURT OR THE 
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WERE COMPLICIT IN MR. VAN 
IDOUR'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE APR'S. 
In his brief, Defendant claims that the presiding judge in his 
case became aware that Mr. Van !dour had not been admitted to 
practice in Washington and attempted to cover up this fact. Brief of 
Petitioner at 2. He later includes a section in his brief questioning 
why the prosecutor's office did not suspect Mr. Van ldour's 
qualifications and suggesting that the State breached its duty as a 
representative of the people. Id. at 11-13. Amicus ACLU joins in 
this argument, alleging that the trial court and prosecutor's office 
"facilitated" Mr. Van ldour's actions. Memorandum of Amicus 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
16 

--- Page 21 ---
Curiae ACLU of Washington at 7. 
Both parties claims that then-judge Galina covered up Mr. 
Van ldour's actions are unsupported by the record. Similarly, the 
claims regarding the prosecutor's office are unfounded. The State 
was not privy to Mr. Van ldour's licensing status, and believed that 
Mr. Van ldour was practicing under APR 8 per the trial court's 
order. It was not until Mr. Van ldour's cases were reassigned that 
the State became aware of the issue. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court of Appeals decision in the Defendant's case 
neither conflicts with this Court's decision in Ratliff nor involves an 
issue of substantial public interest. Because no basis for review 
exists, the State respectfully requests that the Defendant's Petition 
for Review be denied.

Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
The Petitioner was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the 
First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a Controlled 
Substance (Heroin), and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. See 
State v. Justin C. Lewis, 35775-9-111, 2019 WL 1568058 (Div. 111, Apr. 
11, 2019)(Unpublished)(attached hereto).1 The underlying facts of 
the case are largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. 
Those facts pertinent to the issues raised, which this Court specifically 
reque·sted that the State address, are recited herein. 
The Petitioner was represented by attorney Robert Van ldour 
throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order (04/05/17) 
(attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour was, and is still currently, a licensed 
member of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and 
was assigned, at that time, to provide public defense, on contract 
under APR 8( c ). Declaration of Robert J. Van I dour ( attached hereto). 
Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had 
arranged to practice under APR 8(c), which authorizes attorneys who 
are li~ensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public 
defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in 
Washington. DeclarationofRobertJ. Van ldour, DeclarationofVivian 
.eJy, (attached hereto). Prior to contracting with Mr. Van ldour, the 
1The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but 
rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
2 

--- Page 27 ---
Board of County Commissioners inquired of the Superior Court 
Judge, Scott Gallina, regarding Mr. Van ldour's qualifications to 
contract for public defense without being licensed in Washington. 
Declaration of Vivian Bly. Judge Gallina confirmed that Mr. Van ldour 
would be eligible through APR 8(c) process to perform duties under 
a contract while he applied for admission to the Washington State 
Bar. Throughout the process, the Superior Court Administrator made 
periodic efforts to contact the Washington State Bar Association to 
confirm that Mr. Van ldour's application was pending and processing. 
Declaration ofTammyTenny.(attached hereto). On October 26, 2017, 
the Court was notified via email that Mr. Van ldour's application for 
admission had been approved. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. 
In October of 2017, Mr. Van ldour indicated he needed a 
formal order from the Court which was provided, memorializing his 
acceptance by the Court as indigent defense counsel dated October 
6, 2017, nuncpro tune to February 1, 201 7. Declaration of Tammy 
Tenny. 
Not until January 31 , 2018, did the Court receive any 
information that there was any problem with Mr. Van ldour's 
application to practice under APR 8(c).2 The Court immediately 
instructed Mr. Van ldour to arrange to transfer his cases to other 
2 For what it's worth, the Asotin County Prosecutor's office did not 
become aware of any irregularities concerning Mr. Van ldour's eligibility to 
represent indigent defendants until the Court assigned new counsel to Mr. Van 
ldour's cases in February of 2018. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

attorneys. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Subsequently, the Court 
received a letter dated February 13, 2018, indicating Mr. Van ldour 
was not authorized to practice in Washington courts. Declaration of 
Tammy Tenny. 
The Petitioner, who was convicted on October 31, 2017 and 
sentenced on November 7, 2017, appealed his conviction, and it was 
affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, 
supra. 
The Petitioner then filed this personal restraint petition, 
alleging only that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying 
solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in 
Washington. The Defendant does not argue, nor does he make any 
showing that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or 
nonfeasance, nor does he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
RAP 16.11(b) authorizes dismissal of the petition if the petition 
is clearly without merit. The Respondent submits that the issues 
raised by the Petitioner are without merit and lack any basis in fact or 
in the law. 
A PRP is not a substitute for a direct appeal. In re Pers. 
Restraint of Hagler, 97 Wn.2d 818, 824, 650 P.2d 1103 (1982). 
Courts are reluctant to overturn a settled judicial decision where the 
Petitioner has had an opportunity for direct appellate review. In re 
Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 676, 327 P. 3d 660 (2014 ). 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
4 

--- Page 29 ---
Therefore, there are limitations on the use of a PRP to collaterally 
attack a conviction. Hagler, 97 Wn.2d at 824. A personal restraint 
petition must state with particularity the factual allegations which, if 
proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. In re Pers. Restraint of 
Rice, 118 Wn.2d 876, 886, 828 P.2d 1086 (1992). Factual allegations 
must be supported by evidence. 118 Wn.2d at 886. If the record does 
not support the factual allegations, then the petitioner must show 
through affidavits or other forms of corroboration that competent and 
admissible evidence will establish the factual allegations. 118 Wn.2d 
at 886. Bald assertions and conclusory allegations are not sufficient. 
Id. 
To be entitled to collateral relief through a PRP the Petitioner 
must prove the existence of error by a preponderance of the 
evidence. In re Pers. Restraint of Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479, 490, 
251 P. 3d 884 (Div. II, 2010). Assuming error can be shown, he is 
also required to prove prejudice. Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 676. The 
significance of the level of prejudice depends on the type of error 
shown. 
Id. 
To be entitled to relief for a constitutional error, a 
petitioner must also prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
the error caused "actual and substantial prejudice." Id. (Emphasis 
added). This prejudice "must be determined in light of the totality of 
circumstances," and exists only if the error "so infected petitioner' s 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
5 

--- Page 30 ---
entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process." In re 
Pers. Restraint of Music, 104 Wn.2d 189, 191, 704 P.2d 144 ('1985). 
To be entitled to relief for a nonconstitutional error, a petitioner 
must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused 
"a fundamental defect resulting in a complete miscarriage of 
justice." In re Pers. Restraint of Elmore, 162 Wn.2d 236, 251, 172 
P.3d 335 (2007) (emphasis added). With this as the backdrop, the 
State will respond to the issue raised. 
A. 
DESPITE IRREGULARITIES. WITH REGARD TO TRIAL 
COUNSEL'S LICENSURE, THE PETITIONER WAS NOT 
DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL WHERE TRIAL 
COUNSEL WAS A LICENSED ATTORNEY IN GOOD 
STANDING WITH THE IDAHO STATE BAR. 
The Petitioner bases his entire claim on the fact that his trial 
counsel, Robert Van ldour, was not licensed in Washington State. It 
is beyond dispute that Mr. Van ldour was not licenced with the 
Washington State Bar. It is, however, important to note that much of 
the information now contained in the Bar Association's complaint 
against Mr. Van ldour was unknown to either Asotin County or the trial 
court. On advice from the Superior Court Judge, the County entered 
into a contract with Mr. Van ldour, who had decades of experience 
representing criminal defendants. The picture painted by the 
Petitioner of a system which was cavalier with regard to the 
Petitioner's right to counsel is not accurate. The Petitioner was 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
6 

--- Page 31 ---
represented by a veteran and capable attorney throughout the 
process, despite the subsequent revelations regarding counsel's 
failure to obtain licensure. 
There can be no question that a criminal defendant has the 
right to effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 
of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint 
of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 672, 101 P.3d 1 (2004). 
Where a 
defendant is denied counsel because the "attorney" was not licensed 
in any state, prejudice may be presumed. See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 
F.Supp. 472, 474 {S.D.N.Y. 1992), affd, 2 F.3d 403 {2d Cir. 1993). 
However, this per se rule does not apply where the attorney is 
licensed to practice but merely lacks a license in the jurisdiction where 
the case occurs. Id. The Petitioner's reliance on Solina is misplaced. 
As explained in Ferrara: 
In support of his position, petitioner looks to the holding of 
Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir.1983), where the 
court found that a per se violation of the right to counsel had 
occurred where the defendant's counsel had repeatedly failed 
the New York bar examination and was not a member of any 
bar. Here, however, [trial counsel] had been a member of the 
New Jersey bar for more than 30 years and was well 
familiarized with general criminal procedure because of his 
years spent as a county prosecutor. 
Ferrara, at 47 4. Here, Mr. Van ldour was licensed (for more than 30 
years) in Idaho, having handled hundreds of criminal defense cases. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
7 

--- Page 32 ---
Even assuming that his qualifications under APR 8(c) were lacking, 
he was an attorney licensed to practice. As a result, there was no per 
se deprivation of counsel because Mr. Van ldour was licensed to 
practice in Idaho, and the Petitioner must therefore make a further 
showing under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 
2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). 
To establish that the right to effective assistance of counsel 
has been violated, the Petitioner must make two showings: that 
counsel's representation was deficient and that counsel's deficient 
representation caused prejudice. Ferrara, at 474 (citing Strickland v. 
Washington, 466 U.S. at 687). The Petitioner makes no showing that 
Mr. Van ldour was ineffective or that but for any deficient 
performance, the outcome would have been different. First, the 
Petitioner points to no action or inaction on the part of Mr. Van ldour 
that would constitute deficient performance. Further, the Petitioner, 
as evidenced by his failure to aver otherwise, cannot point to any 
scintilla of prejudice suffered as a result of any act or omission on the 
part of Mr. Van ldour. The Petitioner's sole claim rests on the lack of 
a license to practice law in Washington. Because Mr. Van ldour was 
an attorney and licensed by another state, the Petitioner's per se 
claim of deprivation of the right to an attorney fails. He further fails to 
demonstrate His claim therefore necessarily fails.

V. CONCLUSION 
In summary, the petition filed in this matter, based upon the 
record, is without merit. In the best interests of justice this petition 
should be dismissed. The Respondent respectfully requests that this 
Court enter an order dismissing Petitioner's Personal Restraint 
Petition pursuant to RAP 16.11 (b ).

COURT ADMINISTRATOR 
DECLARATION 
Asotin County Superior Court contacted Robert Vanldour via e-mail to inquire of the status of his 
licensure, (see attached e-mail dated March 2, 2017 and follow-up e-mail dated March 17, 2017). Mr. 
Vanldour's response was that the Admissions Department was currently processing his application. 
After several weeks, I called the Washington State Bar Association and spoke with Barbara Ochota 
of the Admissions Department and inquired status regarding Mr. Vanldour's application. Ms. Ochota stated 
that the application was submitted and could take up to 6 months to process. 
On September 5, 2017, I contacted Ms. Ochota via e-mail for·follow-up regarding status of Mr. 
Vanldour's application. Ms. Ochota's response was that it was being reviewed by r~gulatory service counsel. 
On October 26, 2017, Mr. Vanldour forwarded an e-mail from the WSBA stating that the application 
had been approved and that the admissions process needed to be completed. 
· 
On January 31, 2018, Judge Gallina received an e-mail from Mr. Vanldour advising that he had
