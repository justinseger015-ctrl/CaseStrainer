I. 
IDENTITY AND INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE 
The identity and interest of Amicus are set forth in the Motion for 
Leave to File Memorandum of Amicus Curiae in Support of Review. 
II. 
COURT OF APPEALS DECISION  
This memorandum is filed in support of Petitioner Lewis’s Motion 
for Discretionary Review of the published Court of Appeals decision in In 
the Matter of the Personal Restraint of Justin Lewis, Court of Appeals No. 
37284-7 (Div. III May 4, 2021), 2021 WL 1750935.  
III. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Amicus adopts Petitioner’s Statement of the Case. 
IV. 
REASONS WHY REVIEW SHOULD BE GRANTED 
As this Court knows, the criteria for discretionary review in this 
case are set forth in RAP 13.4(b), via RAP 13.5A(b). The Court should 
grant review in this case because it squarely fits most of the criteria for 
review: it raises a significant constitutional issue, the Court of Appeals 
decision was contrary to this Court’s previous decision on that issue, and it 
is of substantial public interest for these reasons but also because it 
implicates this Court’s constitutional duty to govern the practice of law 

--- Page 5 ---
2 
and the duty of the courts to enforce the court rules promulgated by this 
Court. RAP 13.4(b)(1), (3), and (4).1 
 
The Court of Appeals decision is contrary to this Court’s 
decision on the significant constitutional question whether 
structural constitutional error occurs when a person 
representing a criminal defendant has not complied with all 
conditions necessary to legally practice law.  
 
The petitioner has extensively discussed the important 
constitutional issue presented here and the related need to grant review 
because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted this Court’s decision in City 
of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 667 P.2d 630 (1983).2 Amicus ACLU-
WA wishes to add only the following supplemental points.  
The Court of Appeals suggested that what happened in Ratliff was 
a more serious denial of counsel than shown by the facts of the present 
case. But if anything, this case presents a much greater threat to the 
integrity of the criminal justice system and protection of the right to 
counsel than did Ratliff. An isolated incident in a misdemeanor case 
spawned Ratliff: a municipal court judge prevented a licensed legal intern 
from contacting a supervisor as was required for the intern to proceed. The 
 
1 Identical issues are presented in the motion for discretionary review 
pending before this Court in In re the Personal Restraint Petition of 
Robert L. Ayerst, No. 99941-4. 
2 See also Amicus of the Defender Initiative filed in this Court in the 
Ayerst matter.

present case arises in the context of ongoing unauthorized representation 
of criminal defendants in felony cases by a person knowingly hired by a 
county to represent indigent defendants even though he was not qualified 
to practice in Washington and never took the necessary steps to become 
qualified. It also involves the trial court and prosecutor most likely 
knowing (and certainly on notice to know) that the person was not 
qualified to practice in Washington. Contrary to the Court of Appeals’ 
conclusion, this situation did emphatically create the presumptive 
undermining of the constitutional right to counsel recognized in Ratliff and 
requires a finding of actual denial of counsel without any need to show 
prejudice.  
The Court of Appeals’ truncated view of the threat to the right to 
counsel in the present case also led that court to erroneously find that 
Solina v United States, 709 F.2d 160, (2d Cir. 1983) supported denying 
Mr. Lewis’s petition. Lewis, 2021 WL at *2 (“The federal court reasoned 
the concept of prejudice was inapplicable because Mr. Solina’s case 
involved an inherent conflict of interest.”) This was incorrect: the Solina 
court, addressing a situation where the person representing the criminal 
defendant, unknown to the defendant, was actually not a member of any 
bar but had been to law school, said if the standard to be applied was 
harmless error, it would not be satisfied. 709 F.2d at 164-65. But the court 

--- Page 7 ---
4 
in Solina concluded that it was obligated instead to apply a per se rule of 
outright denial of counsel due to the meaning of “counsel” in the Sixth 
Amendment as interpreted by Supreme Court authority. Id. at 168-69. 
Solina thus supports the claim that this Court should apply here, as it did 
in Ratliff, the per se rule.3 This Court should grant review and vacate the 
conviction on this ground.  
 
 
This case presents additional issues of public importance 
regarding this Court’s regulation of those who practice law, 
particularly those who represent criminal defendants, and the 
duty of courts of this state to enforce the court rules.    
In Ratliff, this Court discussed at length its inherent and plenary 
constitutional power to determine the conditions under which persons may 
practice law in this state. 100 Wn.2d at 215-216. Of great importance in 
the present case, those statements of the Court’s broad powers in this 
arena were made in the context of a claim that a person who was 
 
3 Even if the presence of the considerations of potential conflict that the 
Court of Appeals drew from Solina should determine the outcome, in the 
present case they would require overturning the conviction. Solina made 
clear that this point was not about the competence of counsel but rather 
structural constraints on counsel’s performance. In Solina, the constraints 
were found to be theoretical but not real. Here, they were all too real: Mr. 
Van Idour might well have been committing a crime, and as he was 
practicing without a Washington license or any recognized exception he 
was at the mercy of local authorities, including judge and prosecutor, thus 
creating just the kinds of dangers the Court of Appeals felt were necessary 
for Mr. Lewis to be granted relief.

prevented from following the rules for being a properly qualified counsel 
for an accused person rendered the proceeding essentially void.  
Since Ratliff, this Court has significantly modified the 
qualifications for persons representing the accused at public expense. In 
the exercise of its powers to promulgate mandatory court rules and its 
corollary powers to regulate the practice of law, the Court has established 
detailed qualifications that criminal defense counsel must possess and 
publicly certify they meet. See “Standards for Indigent Defense” 
promulgated “to address certain basic elements of public defense related to 
the effective assistance of counsel” CrR 3.1 Stds (Preamble). Standard 14 
requires that all persons representing criminal defendants at public 
expense meet “minimum professional qualifications,” and, not 
surprisingly, the first one listed is: “Satisfy the minimum requirements for 
practicing law in Washington as determined by the Washington Supreme 
Court.” In addition to many other requirements listed in Standard 14 
(including familiarity with court rules), counsel covered by these standards 
must certify quarterly that they meet all of the qualifications this Court has  
established.  
 
This Court recently discussed duties under the Indigent Defense 
Standards:  

--- Page 9 ---

Court rules […] provide, “Before appointing a lawyer for an 
indigent person, or at the first appearance of the lawyer in the case, 
the court shall require the lawyer to certify to the court that he or 
she complies with the applicable Standards for Indigent Defense 
Services.” CrR 3.1(d)(4); CrRLJ 3.1(d)(4); JuCR 9.2(d). Our 
standards for indigent defense apply to any attorney appointed by 
the court to provide public defense representation.  
 
Davison v. State of Washington, 196 Wn.2d 285, 298-99, 466 P. 3d 231 
(2020). As with all court rules, the courts have a role and a duty in 
implementation and enforcement of these rules and standards.4  
 
The Indigent Defense Standards and the general Admission to 
Practice Rules show that this Court has acted deliberately to establish clear 
rules governing not only general qualifications for all who wish to practice 
law in Washington, but also very specific qualifications—presumably 
grounded in the perceived need to protect the constitutional right to 
counsel—for persons representing the accused at public expense. Sadly, 
the record in this case appears to clearly demonstrate that none of the 
Court’s relevant rules were complied with. Because the personal restraint 
petition at issue here involves a criminal prosecution, the facts do raise a 
significant constitutional issue, as described above and in the motion for 
 
4 And while the Court in Davison held that the State Office of Public 
Defense (OPD) is not empowered to “sweep in and remediate” problems 
in the provision of trial level public defense, Id. at 301, OPD is surely not 
prohibited from documenting and seeking to remedy local issues through 
persuasion and other non-coercive means. Thus OPD can and should be an 
important participant in efforts to implement the standards.

discretionary review and amicus brief of The Defender Initiative. But 
these facts also pointedly raise the question of enforcement of the Court’s 
rules and the role played by the trial court and prosecutor in this case.  
The record strongly suggests that the trial court and prosecutor 
knew—or at least certainly should have known—that the person 
purporting to represent Mr. Lewis was not authorized to practice in 
Washington and did not meet the most basic of the Indigent Defense 
Standards. See Lewis Petition (converted to motion for discretionary 
review) at 2, 12-13. Neither of these important actors in the justice system, 
particularly the court, should be free to facilitate this, or even to passively 
allow it. With all due respect, looking the other way is not in the job 
description for these public servants; following and enforcing the rules set 
out by this Court is part of their jobs.  
These issues are of public importance due to the Court’s role in 
protecting the integrity of the justice system and also protecting the public, 
including any members of the public who may be accused of crimes. This 
Court should accept review to make clear that the Admission to Practice 
Rules and Indigent Defense Standards are mandatory and that courts and 
public prosecutors are duty-bound to make sure they are followed.
