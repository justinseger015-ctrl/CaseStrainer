III. REPLY ARGUMENT WHY REVIEW SHOULD BE ACCEPTED 
THE STATE AVERS THAT MR. LEWIS' RIGHT 
TO COUNSEL WAS NOT VIOLATED BECAUSE .. 
HE WAS REPRESENTED BY 
A 
PERSON 
WHO 
WAS A MEMBER OF THE 
IDAHO 
STATE BAR 
AND FURTHER ARGUES THAT MR. LEWIS HAS 
FAILED TO SHOW PREJUDICE •... MR. LEWIS 
DISAGREES 
1. MR. LEWIS WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL 
As the State agree's There can be no question that a criminal 
Defendant has the Right to the Effective Assistance of counsel 
under the Sixth Amendment U.S. Cost. and Art 1, Section 22, of 
The WA. Const. Brief Of Respondent at p.7 
However, the State argues while counsel was not admitted to 
the State of Washington's Bar to practice law. Counsel was in 
fact admitted to the Idaho State Bar. Thus, Mr. Lewis' Right to 
Counsel was satisfied. The State relies on Ferrara V. Keane 806 
F. Supp. 472 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) in support of thier argument that 
Mr. Lewis was Afforded his right to counsel. But Ferrara dealt 
with a Attorney who met the mSUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS• to the 
practice of law. Because he was admitted in the new jersey BAR 
for more than 30 years and was well familiarized with general 
criminal procedure because of his years spent as a county pro-
secuter. Here, Mr. Lewis' counsel decieved the trial court into 
allowing pro hac vice temporary admission to practice law in 
Asotin county. Resaulting, in an Officii.ai complaint filed by 
our state Bar OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL to the SUPREME 
COUJIR~' Alledging the following count's. 
3 

--- Page 6 ---
COUNT ONE: BY PRACTICING LAW IN WASHINGTON WITHOUT AUTHORIZAT 
ION, RESPONDENT VIOLATED RPC 5.S(b), and/or RPC 8.4(b) by: 
( violating RCW 2.48.180) 
COUNT TWO: BY MAKING FALSE and/or MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN HIS 
JULY 23, 2018 LETTER TO one, RESPONDENT VIOLATED RPC 8.1(a) and 
/or RPC 8.4(c) 
But in this case Mr. Lewis' Counsel sought a contract to pro-
vide indigent legal services to criminal defendants. Prequisft~e 
to the contract was that counsel be admitted to Practice law in 
the state of washington. Mr. Lewis' trial counsel knew that if 
he didnt get admitted soon. He would lose the contract and any 
proceeds he would be entitled to. As a resault, he decieved the 
trial court into issuing a Order authorizing limited ability to 
Practice Law Pro Hae Vice. So he wouldnt lose the contract and 
the ability to recieve funds for legal services provided to the 
indigent criminal defendants. 
Once counsel was approved to apply for the Bar, Jire was then 
required to take the next steps in order to obtain admission.It 
has never been established that Mr. Lewis counsel pocessed the 
necessary skill's to practice law in this state. The only thing 
Mr. lewis' counsel did show is the skill's to lie and trick the 
court into issuing an order to allow Pro Hae Vice representat-
ion of criminal defendants in Asotin County. This kind of con-
duct cannot go unpunished nore can it be said Mr. Lewis has had 
his Constitutional Right to Counsel. 
11 noting that the Sixth 
Amenment guarantee of counsel means the assistance by an attor-
ney who has been found qualified to represent a client as by 
Admission to the Bar II United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682, 
696 (9th Cir. 1985) 
4 

--- Page 7 ---
The State further avers, that this court should require the 
defandant in such circumstance's to make a showing under the 
ineffective assistance of counsel test required by Strickland 
that (1) counsel provided deficient performance and (2) that 
resaulted in prejudice. Ignore's the fact in these case's the 
defendant claim's outright denial of right to counsel. The 
State attempt's to belittle Solina v. United states, 709 F.2d 
160 (2d Cir. 1983) Which Mr. Lewis relies. Because Solina had 
dealt with a person not being represented by a person who's not 
a member to any Bar. But counsel here was a member of the Idaho 
State Bar. Misses the point. 
In Solina the court reasoned: 
Both before and since strickland, we have 
held that where a defendant was represent 
ed by an attorney who, unbeknown to the .. 
defendant, was not licensed to practice .. 
law, that defendant has been denied the .. 
constitutional right to counsel. 
Even where the representative was trained 
in the law, where the representative appa-
rently furnished reasonably competent rep-
resentation and where evidence against the 
defendant was so overwhelming that he wou-
ld almost certainly have been convicted ... 
regardless of who represented him. We held 
that a defendant's sixth amendment right .. 
to counsel is violated where, without the 
defendants knowledge, "his representative 
was not authorized to practice law in any 
state, and the lack of authorization stem-
med from failure to seek it or from its .. 
denial for a reason going to legal ability 
such as failure to pass bar examination, or 
want of moral character .. 709 F.2d at 167. 
We there held that "application of a per se 
rule appears to us to be required in a case 
like this by teachings of the supreme court 
709 F.2d at 168.

Mr. Lewis' counsel was not licensed or even authorized to be 
able to practice law in this State, Mr. Lewis never gave his con-
sent to be represented by such a person, and this person was only 
able to represent Mr. Lewis because he decieved the trial court to 
issue a Order allowing Pro Hae Vice Limited Admission to Practice 
Law. 
Should this court find that Mr. Lewis recieved his right to 
counsel under these circumstances would ignore the Supreme Court 
Admission To Practice Rules set in place in order for someone to 
become admitted and/or authorized to Practice Law in our State. 
APR 1 (b) Prerequisites to the Practice of Law state: 
Except as may be otherwise provided in these rules, 
a person shall not appear as an attorney or counsel 
in any of the courts of the state of washington, or 
practice law in this state, unless that person has. 
passed the washington state bar examination, has ... 
complied with the other requirements of these rules 
and is an active member of the washington state Bar 
association (reffered to in these rules as the Bar •. 
association). A person shall be admitted to the prac-
tice of law and become an active member of the Bar. 
association only by order of the supreme court •.... 
It's uncertain as to why the State here would ask this court 
to ignore the principles in our State and excuse counsel's action 
of decieveing our trial court into allowing him to practice law. 
Not to mention decieveing the 100s of Criminal defendant's that 
he represented who all believed that they were being represented 
by a licensed and/or aiuthor~ed person to practice law in there 
State.[1] Not to mention by a judge who was later criminally 
charged for sexual assualt and harassment. 
[1] The TrialJudge Scott D. Gallina was charged by our state for 
sexual assualt's and harassment. Shortly after Mr. Lewis was in 
his court room. It's important to note this is the same judge at 
issue who gave Mr. Lewis' counsel Pro Hae Vice Admission.

As shown above it cant be said that Mr. Lewis has recieved 
his constitutional right to counsel. Should this court allow it 
to stand that a person purported to be an attorney can just go 
into any courthouse in our State and Obtain a Pro Hae Vice Order 
to admit him to Practice Law. Would ignore our State's BedRock 
principles that have always been in place. As layed out in the 
Supreme Court Rule's Admission to Practice (APR). 
In essence this Court would be opening up our boarders and 
saying any person who is a member in another State Bar can come 
to our state and Practice Law without haven to be a member to our 
State Bar and/or obtain Authorization from our Supreme Court to 
Practice Law. That such Person's dont need to be of good Moral or 
have to Qualify for our Bar examination; and in each instance in 
cases where they have been appointed by the trial court the sixth 
amendment and article 1, section 22 right to counsel has been and 
always will be satisfied. Even though there skill's and abilities 
have never been tested. Nore thier quailification's been reviewed 
by any per~on. Not to mention decieved the trial court into given 
him Pro Hae Vice ability to practice law. This cant stand and as 
the CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT requires: 
CANON 1: An independent and honorable judiciary 
is indispensable to justice in our society •••• 
CANON 2: Judges should respect and comply with 
the law and act at all times in a manner that 
promotes public confidence in the integrity and 
impartiality of the judiciary •.. 
To set such a rule that anybody from anywhere that is not 
admitted to practice law in our state but in another State can 
7 

--- Page 10 ---
simply come to Washington State and Practice Law and not have to 
follow our rules of Admission to Practice Law. Would not in any 
way promote public confidence in the integrity and impartaility 
of the judiciary. But rather, create a fear of it and our system 
of justice as a whole. As such, This court should find Mr. Lewis 
was denied his right to counsel and protect the constitutional 
and statutory right of the accused. As well the judicary and the 
criminal justice system as a whole. 
1. PREJUDICE IS PRESUMED WHERE A DEFENDANT IS DENIED COUNSEL 
Next the State avers, that Mr. Lewis need's to establish the 
Strckland test that (1) counsel Provided deficient performance 
and (2) resaulting prejudice. The state avers, that this is so 
because Mr. Lewis was provided counsel. Mr. Lewis Disagrees. 
There are two rationales for applying the Per Se rule. The 
first is II Jurisdictional II and applies in cases where the att-
orney is not duly licensed. It stems from the Supreme court's 
decision in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 u.s. 458, 468, 82 L.ed. 1461 
58 s.ct. 1019 (1948), that the failure to provide a criminal 
defendant with counsel created II a jursidictional bar to a valid 
conviction II see Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 168-69 
(2nd Cir.)( discerning no meaningful distinction between total 
absence of representation and representation by unlicensed co-
unsel ). 
The second, rationale is based on motions of conflict of in-
terest, which applies in cases where the lawyer is not duly li-
censed. see United States v. Novak, 903 F.2d 883, 890 (2nd Cir. 
1990). 
Under these circumstances, the defence is necessarily 
compromised b'e'cause the advocate II cannot wholly be free from 
8 

--- Page 11 ---
fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should lead the 
prosecuter or the trial judge to inquire into his [orWEBEt'], back-
ground and discover his II o:fi::' her own wrongdoing. Solina, 709 F.2d 
at 164. Under either rational, it is plain that for a defendant 
to prevail on a per se claim, the defendant must show that his or 
her attorney had an actual substantive defect in licensure or an 
actual conflict of interest that existed at the time of trial.see 
e.g., Novak, 903 F.2d at 890; Solina, 709 F.2d at 164. 
A. THE STATE AGREES THAT COUNSEL SUFFERS ACTUAL DEFECT IN COUNSEL 
FOR MR. LEWIS'S LICENSURE 
There stand's no question Mr. Lewis' attorney was not ever a 
licensed and/or authorized counsel in the State of washington. As 
such, the Per Se rule should apply. Because Counsel for Mr. Lewis 
was not licensed or lawfully authorized to practice law. see. att 
achment D Official Complaint filed to supreme court •. see also 
Response Brief of Petitoner at p.6. In our state. 
B. THERE EXISTED A TRUE CONFLICT OF INTERST 
Because counsel was not licensed in our state, the defence is 
necessarily compromised because the advocate II cannot wholly be 
free from fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should 
lead the prosecuter or trial judge to inquire into his background 
and discover his "wrongdoing" which infact happened and now the 
subject of an official complaint filed by the Washington state.:r.itn. 
Bar to the State Supreme Court ... 
Because both of these rationaies have been met Mr. Lewis has 
satisfied the requirements necessary to adopt the Per Se rule in 
this case and reverse Mr. Lewis' conviction and Order a new trial 
by a licensed and authorized counsel in our State.

IV. CONCLUSION 
Based on the above Mr. Lewis ask's this court to reject the 
use of the Strckland test and apply the Perse rule in this case 
and find Mr. Lewis was denied counsel and reverse his conviction 
and remand for a new trial with qualified and proven licensure in 
our State.
