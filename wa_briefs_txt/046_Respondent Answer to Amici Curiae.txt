II. 
INTRODUCTION 
Since the Respondent filed their Supplemental Brief 
1n this case, the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Washington (
11ACLU"), The Defender Initiative and the 
Washington Defender Association jointly ("The Defender 
Initiative"), and the Office of Public Defense have each filed 
an Amicus Curiae brief. Collectively, these briefs raise 
several issues including the standard to apply, the role of 
the Standards of Indigent Defense ("SID") in determining 
the right to counsel, the application of City of Seattle v. 
Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212 (1983), and whether a conflict of 
interest exits similar to the one in Solina v. United States, 
709 F.2d 160 (2nd Cir. 1983). To the extent that Amici 
argue for a per se standard of prejudice, the Respondent 
has already addressed that issue in its Supplemental Brief. 
The remaining issues are addressed herein. 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
2 

--- Page 8 ---
Ill. 
ARGUMENT 
1. THE STANDARDS OF INDIGENT DEFENSE ARE 
SIMILAR IN EFFECT TO OTHER PRACTICE RULES 
AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DETERMINE THE 
BASELINE REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNSEL 
Amicus American Civil Liberties Union of Washington 
and Amicus The Defender Initiative/Washington Defender 
Association suggest this Court should find that the 
Petitioners were deprived of "counsel" for constitutional 
purposes because Mr. Van ldour failed to comply with the 
Standards of Indigent Defense set out in Court Rule 3.1. 
Amicus Curiae Brief of American Civil Liberties Union of 
Washington ("Amicus ACLU") at 3".'5; Brief of Amici Curiae 
The 
Defender Initiative and Washington 
Defender 
Association (Amici Defender Initiative) at 26. However, the 
United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington 
rejected the use of professional standards to determine 
what qualifies as "counsel" under the Sixth Amendment. 
466 U.S. 668, 688-89 (1984). The Washington Court of 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
3 

--- Page 9 ---
Appeals has since done the same. State v. Flores, 197 
Wn.App.1, 10 (2016). This Court should adoptthose courts' 
sound reasoning and ignore this red herring argument. 
In Strickland, the United States Supreme Court set 
forth the standard used to determine whether a defendant 
has been deprived of "counsel" for constitutional purposes. 
466 U.S. at 667. In doing so, the Court examined the 
purpose of the right to counsel and, in light of that purpose, 
the circumstances under which that right is denied. Id. at 
684~686. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the purpose 
of the right to counsel is to ensure a fair trial. Id. at 686. 
Thus, a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment 
rights only when their conviction "resulted from a breakdown 
in the adversary process that render[ed] the result 
unreliable." Id. at 687. 
Additionally, the Court emphasized that "[p]revailing 
norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association 
Standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal 
Justice 4-1 .1 to 4-8.6 (2d ed. 1980) ("The Defense 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
4 

--- Page 10 ---
Function"), are guides to determining what is reasonable, 
but they are only guides." Id. at 688. The reasoning behind 
this is twofold. First, the Court expressed concern that 
establishing a more rigid set of rules "would interfere with 
the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and 
restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making 
tactical decisions." Id. at 689. Second, the Court recognized 
that where professional standards are generally intended to 
improve the quality of legal representation, the purpose of 
the Sixth Amendment is "simply to ensure that criminal 
defendants receive a fair trial." Id; see also Reese v. Peters, 
926 F.2d 668 (7th Cir. 1991) (discussing the difference 
between "[t]he constitutional question" about trial counsel's 
competence and disbarment, which can occur for other 
reasons). 
Similarly, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
Respondent's 
supplemental brief, Division Three of the Court of Appeals 
held in State v. Flores 
that noncompliance with the 
Standards of Indigent Defense (SID) as set forth in Criminal 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
5 

--- Page 11 ---
Rule 3.1 does not constitute a per se violation of the right to 
counsel. 197 Wn.App. at 15.1 In that case, the appellant 
pointed to two distinct violations of the SID as deprivation of 
his right to counsel. See Id. at 8-10. While the court was 
unable to address the issue of counsel's certification under 
CrR 3.1{d){4) on the record provided, the court was able to 
fully address whether the defendant's right to counsel was 
violated when his attorney did not have two years of 
criminal practice experience as required by Standard 14.2 
B. Flores, 197Wn.App. at 12. 
In rejecting the appellant's argument, Division Three 
considered this Court's holdings in State v. A.N.J, 168 
Wn.2d 91 (2010) and In re. Pers. Restraint of Gomez, 180 
Wn.2d 337 (2014) that similar guidelines put forth in the 
Washington Defender Association's Standards for Public 
Defense Services did not establish minimum Sixth 
1Contrary to Amicus the Defender Initiative's assertions, the 
Respondent did not intend attribute the holding of Flores to this 
Court. Amici DI at 24. Respondent simply wished to indicate that 
this Court had declined the opportunity to reverse Division Three's 
ruling. 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER

--- Page 12 ---
Amendment requirements. Flores, 197 Wn.App. 13-14. 
Additionally, the court there recognized that rules 
promulgated by this Court create procedural, but not 
substantive, rights. Id. at 10-11, citing State v. Templeton, 
148 Wn.2d 193,212 (2002). Based on this, the Flores court 
concluded that the SID serve. a similar role to other 
professional standards and that "adoption of the SID did not 
redefine what constitutes counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment." Id. at 15. A similar conclusion was reached by 
Division Two in an unpublished opinion. See State v. 
Mabruk, 2018 WL 3026101 (2018) (see GR 14.1), review 
denied, 191 Wn.2d 1023 (2018). 
With regard to the SID, this Court should uphold the 
Division Three's holding in Flores. To do otherwise would 
incorrectly place more emphasis on whether counsel 
followed a particular checklist than the more important 
question of whether the defendant received a fair trial. 
Furthermore, as the Flores court worried: 
To do anything else is to impose a higher 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
7 

--- Page 13 ---
standard 
of representation 
for 
indigent 
defendants than the Sixth Amendment requires 
for retained counsel. Here, even if Mr. Raheem 
had committed no errors at all, or had achieved 
an acquittal on all counts save some 
uncontested misdemeanor charge, Mr. Flores 
would still receive a new trial due to 
noncompliance with Standard 14.2. Such an 
outcome places the rule above that it is 
supposed to effectuate. 
Id. at 14-15. 
Here, trial counsel had 30 years of experience in 
criminal defense and was in good standing in at least one 
jurisdiction at the time he represented Petitioners. To 
conclude, in essence, that Mr. Van ldour violated the 
Petitioners' right to counsel simply because he did not file 
the correct paperwork on time runs contrary to the purpose 
of the Sixth Amendment. 
Additionally, Amicus the ACLU and Amicus the Office 
of Public Defense complain that unless this Court reverses 
the Petitioners' convictions, its supervision of indigent 
defense is effectively unenforceable. Amicus ACLU at 10, 
Brief of Amicus Curiae Washington State Office of Public

Defense (Amicus OPD) at 130. These arguments ignore the 
other tools of enforcement available to this Court. Lawyers 
in violation of professional standards may be subject to 
discipline by this Court through the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel. See ELC 2.3. Furthermore, decisions by the 
disciplinary board may be reviewed directly by this Court. 
See ELC 12.3-4. This was the case here when Mr. Van 
ldour was ultimately suspended from the practice of law in 
Washington for eighteen months. In re Robert Jerry Van 
ldour, Supreme Court No. 202,021-6, Order Imposing 18-
month Suspension, September 7, 2021. 
Similarly, judges are subject to discipline by the 
Commission on Judicial Conduct. See generally RCW 2.64~ 
Decisions by the Commission are reviewable by this Court. 
See, e.g., DRJ 1. If this Court determines that misconduct 
occurred, it may impose the discipline recommended by the 
Commission or "any other sanction [this Court] deems 
proper." DRJ 9(c). This Court's decision is final, subject to 
a limited reconsideration process. See DRJ 9(d). Through 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE

--- Page 15 ---
these processes, this Court has the ability to regulate the 
actors directly involved in compliance (or noncompliance) 
with the rules at issue here.2 Requiring reversal in cases 
based on attorneys' or judges' noncompliance with the SID 
or various other practice standards is not only unnecessary, 
it also punishes innocent third parties, especially crime 
victims who are then forced to go through the trial process 
a second time. 
2.THE HOLDING IN RA TL/FF. WHICH EXTENDS 
THE DEFINITION OF "COUNSEL" TO INDIVIDUALS 
PRACTICING UNDER SPECIFIC RULES THAT 
WOULD NOT OTHERWISE QUALIFY, IS 
DISTINGUISHABLE. 
Amici stress the importance of City of Seattle v. 
Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, in determining whether a complete 
2With regard to any argument that the prosecutor's office 
should have somehow enforced Mr. Van ldour's compliance with 
the APRs and SID, the Respondent would respectfully remind this 
Court that RCW 10.101.040 prohibits city attorneys, county 
prosecutors, and law enforcement officers from selecting public 
defenders. 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
10 

--- Page 16 ---
deprivation of counsel occurred in this case. See, e.g., 
Amicus ACLU at 12; Amici DI at 21; Amicus OPD at 8. 
However, not only is Ratliff distinguishable from the case at 
bar, Amici overlook the importance of the other issue raised 
in that appeal. 
In Ratliff, this Court held that representation by a legal 
intern licensed under APR 9 ("rule 9 intern"), who has been 
prevented from complying with that rule, is a per se violation 
of the right to counsel. 100 Wn.2d at 221 . By the time that 
case reached this Court, two separate issues had been 
raised. The defendant argued that he was denied effective 
assistance of counsel because the intern was given 
insufficient time to prepare his case and was prevented 
from consulting his supervising attorney as required by APR 
9. Id. at 215. In addition, the Court of Appeals, sua sponte, 
questioned whether representation of an indigent defendant 
by a law student, without the presence of a supervising 
attorney in court, constituted a per se violation of the right 
to counsel. Id. 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
11 

--- Page 17 ---
Much of the language cited by Amici comes from this 
Court's discussion of the challenge to APR 9, including this 
Court's reminder to the legal community that it has the 
constitutionally granted power to determine who may 
appear before the bar, and that this power is both "well 
established" and "inviolate." Id. at 215. However, that 
language is directed at this Court's power to include certain 
individuals in, rather than preclude them from, the definition 
of "counsel." This Court explained that it promulgated and 
adopted APR 9 to allow 
1'lesser qualified persons to engage 
in limited practice" so long as certain specific requirements 
are adhered to Id. at 216. Ultimately, this Court held that 
when APR 9 is complied with, a criminal defendant receives 
legal assistance "sufficient to meet with both state and 
federal constitutions." Id. at 218. 
Only then did this Court turn to the facts of the 
defendant's case. Whereas a law student acting in 
compliance with APR 9 does qualify as counsel for Sixth 
Amendment purposes, this Court, apparently relying on 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
12 

--- Page 18 ---
federal precedent, held, "representation by a law student 
intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon 
his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the 
right to counsel which requires reversal." Id. at 19 
(emphasis added), citing Cheatham v. State, 364So.2d 83, 
84 
(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) 
(failure 
to 
comply with 
requirements that supervising attorney be present and 
defendant be informed of student status); In re Moore, 63 
III.App.3d 899, 904 (1978) (failure to inform court of student 
status and failure to obtain defendant's written consent); cf. 
People v. Masonis, 58 Mich.App. 615, 619 (1975) (law 
student representation did not violate right to counsel where 
defendant was aware of student status, general effective 
assistance of counsel standards were met, and there was 
no violation of student practice rules). Because the record 
demonstrated that the law student representing the 
defendant was prevented from complying with the 
requirements of APR 9 which would have· otherwise 
qualified him as counsel, this Court held that there was a 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
13 

--- Page 19 ---
denial counsel "in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 
213. 
The case at bar is distinguishable from the facts of 
Ratliff. This Court's discussion in Ratliff of the power to 
regulate the practice of law is oriented towards this Court's 
constitutional power to decide when an individual may 
affirmatively be admitted to practice in Washington State. It 
does 
not necessarily follow that every individual 
represented by counsel acting out of compliance with the 
APRs is denied counsel. Absent the requirements of APR 
9, a legal intern is comparable to a lay person because they 
have never been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction 
and, in many cases, have not yet completed their legal 
studies. By contrast, an attorney admissible pro hac vice 
under APR 8, while not licensed in Washington state, has 
completed their legal studies and qualified as an attorney in 
at least one jurisdiction. See APR 8(b ). Even if that attorney 
were to later fail to comply with the requirements of APR 8, 
he would still have legal training and specialized knowledge

necessary to ensure a fair trial. 
3. AMICl'S ANALYSIS OF SOLINA IGNORES 
CRUCIAL LANGUAGE OF THAT CASE 
DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE CASE AT BAR. 
Finally, Amicus the OPD asserts that the court below 
incorrectly relied on Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 
(2nd Cir. 1983} at all to reach its conclusion. Amicus OPD 
at 11 . However, they then argue that Division Three 
incorrectly applied the holding Solina based on the fact that 
Mr. Van ldour was not licensed in Washington at the time 
he represented the Petitioners. Amicus the ACLU touches 
briefly on this issue as well. Amicus ACLU at 12-13. Aside 
from being contradictory, this argument also ignores 
specific language in Solina stating that: 
In so construing the original understanding of 
the term "counsel" we do not intimate that any 
technical defect in the licensed status of a 
defendant's representative would amount to a 
violation of the Sixth Amendment. We limit our 
decision in this case to situations where, 
unbeknown to the defendant, his representative 
was not authorized to practice law in any state, 
RESPONDENT'S ANSWER 
TO AMICI CURIAE 
15 

--- Page 21 ---
and the lack of such authorization stemmed 
from failure to seek it or from its denial for a 
reason going back to legal ability, such as 
failure to pass a bar examination, or want of 
moral character ... 
Solina, 709 F.2d at 167. There, the "attorney" in question 
had twice failed the bar examination and was never 
admitted in any state. Id. at 162. Here, Mr. Van ldour had 
passed a bar examination been admitted in a neighboring 
Jurisdiction for over three decades. On those facts alone, 
the case at bar is distinguishable from Solina. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The new issues raised by Amici fail to demonstrate 
that Petitioners were denied "counsel" for the purposes of 
the Sixth Amendment. Furthermore, the Respondent 
maintains that a demonstration of prejudice is required as 
set forth in the Supplemental Brief. Therefore, the 
Respondent respectfully requests that this Court affirm the 
Petitioner's convictions.
