I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMARY OF ARGUMENT 
The Washington Constitution makes "every elective public 
officer of the state of Washington [except] judges of the court of 
record ... subject to recall and discharge by the legal voters of 
the state, or of the political subdivision of the state, from which 
he[/she] was elected." Wash. Const. Art. I§§ 3~ and 34. 
In State ex rel. Citizens Against Mandatory 
Bussing v. Brooks, 80 Wn.2d 121, 492 P.2d 536 (1972), it was 
observed that our constitution establishes a very broad right of 
the electorate to recall elective public officials. The challenge in 
that case was to the sufficiency of charges set forth in a recall 
petition. 
The rules which guide the courts in examining the 
sufficiency of such charges, which are set forth there, exemplify 
the principle that the judiciary must exercise restraint in 
interfering with the elective process which is reserved to the 
people in the State Constitution. 
2 

--- Page 8 ---
Cases in which it was held that an election will not be set 
aside for a mere informality or irregularity which cannot be said 
in any manner to have affected the result of the P-lection also 
illustrate that principle. Among them are State ex rel. Dore v. 
Superior Court, 171 Wash. 423, 18 P.2d 51 (1933) (holding an 
election notice sufficient even though it contained an inaccurate 
description of the office to be filled); School Dist. 81 v. 
Taxpayers, 37 Wn.2d 669,225 P.2d 1063 (1950) (holding that 
election notice requirements are not mandatory); Vickers v. 
Schultz, 195 Wash. 651, 81 P.2d 808 (1938) (holding that the 
failure to post notice of an election, as required by statute, 
would not vitiate the election where it was shown that the 
purpose of the notice was served by the wide publicity given 
the election); *76 Seymour v. Tacoma, 6 Wash. 427, 33 P. 1059 
(1893) (holding that an election would not be defeated by such 
irregularities as posting notice 26 days rather than the 30 days 
required by statute); Rands v. Clarke County, 79 Wash. 152, 139 
3 

--- Page 9 ---
P. 1090 ( 1914) (holding that failure to post notice did not render 
an election invalid and citing a number of cases which had 
previously held that notice requirements are directory rather 
than mandatory, unless the legislature has specifically provided 
that failure to post notice will invalidate the election); and 
Murphy v. Spokane, 64 Wash. 681, 117 P. 476 (1911) (holding 
that an election was not invalidated by the failure of the election 
officers to observe or comply with the statutory requirements 
that a certain number of election officers be selected and 
qualified in a specified manner, that they be present at all times, 
that they take an oath of office, or that the polls be opened on 
time and kept open during the time prescribed by law). 
[McCormick v. Okanogan County, 90 Wn.2d 71 (1978) 578 
P.2d 1303.] 
The recall process as it was originally intended when 
passed by constitutional amendment, was to be broad. From 
the time this court first decided a case dealing with the recall 
4 

--- Page 10 ---
right promulgated in Wash. Const. Art. 1, §§ 33 and 34 (amend. 
8),[1] to as recently as last year, [2] we have always interpreted 
the recall provision broadly so as to allow the people to exercise 
their right of self-governance. [Fred J Dore - Chandler v. Otto, 
103 Wn.2d 268 (1984)]. 
Elected officials in Washington may be recalled by the 
voters if they have "committed some act or acts of malfeasance 
or misfeasance while in office" or violated an "oath of office." 
Wash. Const. Art. I,§§ 2, 33. To protect public officials "from 
petitions based on frivolous or unsubstantiated charges[,] ... 
the courts serve a gateway function in the recall process," 
evaluating whether a recall petition states facts which, if 
true, constitute a recallable offense. In re Recall of Kast, 144 
Wn.2d 807,813 (2001). [In the matter of the Recall of Sawant, 
No. 99948-1, 2021.] [In re Recall of Kast, 144 Wn.2d 807, 813 
(2001).] 
5 

--- Page 11 ---
The courts do not decide whether the facts alleged in the 
petition are true, or whether a particular offense is sufficiently 
egregious to justify recall, because "the right of recall is 
guaranteed to the citizens of this State, and it is for the people 
to decide if [some wrongful act] is of sufficient severity to 
warrant a recall election." In re Recall of Pearsall-Stipek, 141 
Wn.2d 756, 770 (2000). 
Governor Jay Inslee, via his council at the Attorney 
General's office, has asserted that our charges do not have legal 
or factual sufficiency. Which is to say that they have asserted 
that our charges are "frivolous or unsubstantiated charges", 
which is clearly false. The Superior Court erred in their 
decision. We will argue and show that they are sufficient and 
substantiated, enough to allow the voters of the state of 
Washington to decide.

II. 
BACKGROUND 
Petitioners exercised their constitutional rights by filing a 
Statement of Charges against Governor Jay Inslee. The 
Statement of Charges recited five acts of malfeasance, 
misfeasance, or violation of the Governor Inslee's oath of 
office. 
The Superior Court for Thurston County held a hearing to 
determine the factual and legal sufficiency of those charges, 
before which the parties submitted additional briefing and 
factual materials. 
As is consistent with Washington State procedures 
( although NOT codified in the RCW), the Attorney General's 
office represents the Governor in a recall demand, however, the 
7 

--- Page 13 ---
Attorney General's office also represents the 
proponents/petitioners in the recall demand. In this case the 
judge in the trial court, was Judge Carol Murphy, a 17-year 
employee of the Attorney General's office and potentially a 
conflict of interest. By appearance alone, Judge Murphy should 
have recused herself from the case. 
Judge Murphy in making her decision erred in the scope 
of her interpretation of sufficiency. 
"The court here must make two determinations: First, 
the sufficiency of the charges, that is, whether the acts stated in 
the charges offered in support of the recall satisfy the criteria 
for which a recall petition may be filed; and second, whether 
the ballot synopsis prepared by the Attorney Geueral is 
adequate." 
Judge Murphy should have recognized that the criteria of 
sufficiency was NOT frivolous and not unsubstantiated". 
8 

--- Page 14 ---
Where there is evidence presented of malfeasance, misfeasance 
or a violation of oath of office, it becomes the purview of the 
voters to make the final decision. 
Judge Murphy further erred in her statement that our case 
did not show INTENT to act unlawfully. Knowingly [ or should 
have known] undertaking an unlawful act, is in fact INTENT to 
act unlawfully. 
Other errors in the Judge Murphy's decision will be 
address specifically by charge. 
III. ARGUMENT 
Washington's recall process safeguards against voters 
with a grudge harassing elected officials for making a decision 
the voter did not like, or for minor, innocuous mistakes. See, 
e.g., Pearsall-Stipek, 141 Wn.2d at 767. 
"Courts act as a gateway to ensure that charges are 
factually and legally sufficient before they are placed before the 
9 

--- Page 15 ---
voters." Matter of Recall of Boldt, 187 Wn.2d 542, 548 (2017). 
"A petition is factually sufficient when the charges, taken as a 
whole, identify to the electors and to the official being recalled 
acts or failure to act which without justification would 
constitute prima facie showing of misfeasance, malfeasance, or 
a violation of the oath of office." In re Recall of Pepper, 189 
Wn.2d 546, 555 (2017) (internal citations omitted), a petition is 
legally sufficient if it "state[ s] with specificity substantial 
conduct clearly amounting to misfeasance, malfeasance or 
violation of the oath of office." See Chandler v. Otto, 103 
Wn.2d 268, 274 (1984). 
When there is evidence that an elected official violated 
the law or his/her oath of office, voters have the constitutional 
right to interpret that evidence, decide its import, and determine 
whether it justifies the official's removal. Wash. Const. Art. I,§ 
33. Voters may also "draw reasonable inferences from the 
facts; the fact that conclusions have been drawn by the 
10 

--- Page 16 ---
petitioner is not fatal to the sufficiency of the allegations." See 
Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549 (quoting In re Recall of West, 155 
Wn.2d 659,665 (2005) (citing Chandler v. Otto, 103 Wn.2d 
268, 274 (1984))). 
"Role of the courts in the recall process is highly 
limited." See Kast, 144 Wn.2d at 813. The Superior Court 
incorrectly found the charges against Governor Jay lnslee were 
legally and factually insufficient and failed approved a ballot 
synopsis. 
The Governor should make his arguments to the voters 
directly. RCW 29A.56.140; See Pepper, 189 Wn.2d at 554 ("It 
is the voters, not the courts, who will ultimately act as the fact 
finders"). 
At no point in our argument have we commented on the 
existence of Covid-19, nor have we commented on the impact 
of this virus. We have also NOT weighed in on any of the 
11 

--- Page 17 ---
treatments ( or vaccines). These topics are not a matter of law, 
but simply a matter of medical consideration. We only argue 
that Governor Inslee committed lawless acts, knowingly and as 
such with intent. We choose not to address whether a crime 
once committed has a benefit or a negative outcome. 
A. The recall charges are as follows: 
Charge #1. On or about March 23, 2020, Governor 
Inslee issued Proclamation 20-25, "Stay Home - Stay Healthy." 
The Stay Home - Stay Healthy order prohibited all people in 
Washington State from participating in social, spiritual and 
recreational gatherings of any kind regardless of the number of 
participants. Violations of Proclamation 20-25 were punishable 
as crimes pursuant to RCW 43.06.220(5). Proclamation 20-25 
violated Article I, § 11 of the Washington State Constitution, 
"Religious Freedom." 
12 

--- Page 18 ---
Charge #2. On or about March 18, 2020, Governor 
Inslee issued Proclamation 20-19, "Evictions." The Evictions 
order prohibited residential landlords from initiating judicial 
action seeking a writ of restitution involving a dwelling unit if 
the alleged basis for the writ is the failure of the tenant or 
tenants to timely pay rent. Violations of Proclamation 20-19 
were punishable as crimes pursuant to RCW 43.J6.220(5). 
Proclamation 20-19 violated Article IV, § 1 of the Washington 
State Constitution, "Judicial Power, Where Vested." 
Charge #3. Governor Inslee exceeded statutory 
authority granted in RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending the 
Open Public Meetings Act, infringing on the people of 
Washington's right to petition the government for redress and 
infringing on the people's rights to peaceably assemble under 
the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, thereby 
violating RCW 43.06.220(2)(g). Such a violation ofRCW 
43.06.220(2)(g) constitutes misfeasance, a violation of the 
13 

--- Page 19 ---
Governor's oath of office, or both; either result subjects the 
Governor to recall. 
Charge #4. Governor Inslee exceeded statutory 
authority granted in RCW 43 .06.220(2)(g) by st:.spending 
people's rights to peaceably assemble by limiting the number of 
people allowed to attend a single gathering under Proclamations 
20-05, 20-06, 20-07, 20-11, and subsequent Proclamations. 
Such a violation results in a valid claim for misfeasance, a 
violation of the Governor's oath of office, or both; either result 
subjects the Governor to recall. 
Charge #5. On February 29, 2020, and beyond, the 
Governor issued all of the Covid-19 pandemic Proclamations 
without just cause as he failed to make a finding that a public 
disorder, disaster, energy emergency, or riot existed in the State 
of Washington due to Covid-19. Such a finding is a condition 
precedent to declaring a state of emergency and is required by 
RCW 43.06.010(12). The Governor's illegal Covid-19 
14 

--- Page 20 ---
Proclamations result in a valid claim for misfeasance, a 
violation of the Governor's oath of office, or both; either result 
subjects the Governor to recall. 
Charge #1: Violation of Religious Liberty 
We do not challenge the decision on Charge # 1 and do 
NOT ask for review on this charge. 
Charge #2: Violation of Separation of Powers and the 
Independence of the Judiciary. 
Governor Jay Inslee violated separation ox' powers, held 
by case law, when he prohibited landlords from exercising their 
fundamental right to FILE an unlawful detainer with the court, 
for redress of wrongs arising from a tenants' failure to pay rent. 
a. The Charge (#2) is Factually and Legally 
Sufficient 
The very essence of civil liberty consists in the right of 
every individual to claim the protection of the laws through the 
15 

--- Page 21 ---
courts, whenever he/she receives an injury. Marbury v. 
Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803); 
Putman v. Wenatchee Valley Med. Cent., P.S., 166 Wn.2d 974, 
979 (2009). The Governor, through Proclamation 20-05 and 
20-19, stripped a class of Washington residents of the 
fundamental, constitutionally protected right to access courts. 
The Governor seemingly argues that he suspended a 
"substantive right," not a "procedural" one. This 
misinterpretation of the law is flat out wrong on an issue that 
has been clear since Waples v. Yi, 169 Wn.2d 152 (2013) 
(Striking down a pre-suit notice imposed by the legislature on 
pre-suit notice for medical malpractice claims). 
The judicial power of the state is vested in the Supreme 
Court and superior courts both with an independent 
constitutional authority. Wash. Const. Art. IV, §§ 1, 2, and 6. 
The Supreme Court has the inherent right to determine its court 
16 

--- Page 22 ---
rules, including how Washington courts are accessed. See 
Waples, 169 Wn.2d at 159-160. 
The legislative branch, with one limited exception, 
cannot modify how courts are accessed unless allowed to do 
this via a court rule. As noted by Governor Inslee, CR 81 
allows for legislative modifying of "special proceedings", but 
even that modification is made by a court rule. The Supreme 
Court, not the legislature nor the executive branches of the 
Washington state government, defines how Washington citizens 
access our courts. 
In violation of this fundamental right, Governor Inslee 
has clearly stated that landlords are forbidden from serving 
process on unlawful detainer actions. Governor Inslee's basis 
for this position is that it would be oppressive for tenants to 
have to appear in court: 
WHEREAS, under RCW 59.12 (Unlawful 
Detainer), RCW 59.18 (Residential Landlord-
17 

--- Page 23 ---
RCW59 
Tenant Act), and RCW 59.20 
(Manufactured/Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Act) 
residents seeking to avoid default judgment in 
eviction hearings need to appear in court in order 
to avoid losing substantial rights to assert defenses 
or access legal and economic assistance. 
Governor Inslee is clearly attempting to interfere with a 
statutory requirement to appear in court and answer to a 
landlord's plea for justice and enforcement of a property right, 
which he will achieve by interfering with the right to serve 
process, a procedural function and right of the courts, not one 
the executive branch. 
The Governor claims benevolence through "returning" 
rights to landlords who are selling their property, or landlords 
whose tenant are creating a significant risk to life, safety, or 
property. However, the Governor's "benevolence" occurs 
through his modification of a procedural rule that fits squarely 
in the judicial branch's arena by creating a pre-filing procedural 
18 

--- Page 24 ---
requirement that a landlord submit a declaration that a 
transaction is based on harm to health or property. 
Without the required declaration, the transaction cannot 
advance. This procedural requirement is akin to the procedural 
hurdle struck down in Putman, Id. The Governor clearly 
provides no testing of this declaration for its authenticity or 
standard by which it is measured for truth (preponderance, clear 
and convincing, etc.); therefore, it must be a procedural change 
to the law. Even assuming the RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) gives the 
Governor the power to create legislation, it does not give him 
the right to limit access to courts. Our Supreme Court has been 
clear: procedural court rules are part of the access to 
justice; those procedural rules are the courts' alone. By 
prohibiting a group of Washington citizens from access to 
courts, Governor Inslee has violated his oath of office, and 
acted with misfeasance.

"Character of actor's intention. In order that an act 
may be done with the intention of bringing about a 
harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension 
thereof to a particular person, either the other 
or a third person, the act must be dc,ne for the 
purpose of causing the contact or apprehension or 
with knowledge on the part of the actor that such 
contact or apprehension is substantially certain to 
be produced." 
See Garratt v. Dailey, 46 Wn.2d 197 (1955) 279 P.2d 
1091. 
Certainly, by prohibiting a landlord from filing an 
unlawful detainer, 1) any reasonable person would foresee a 
harmful outcome, both to the independence of the court as well 
as to the landlord, 2) an attorney licensed in the state of 
Washington would know (or should have known), that violating 
separation of powers would cause harm to the independence of 
the court as well as to the financial harm to the landlord. 
While Governor Inslee asserts that his action was to 
relieve tenant's anxiety, which it termed as oppression, it is not 
20 

--- Page 26 ---
lawful nor reasonable to disestablish separation of powers and 
HARM the landlord to that end. 
When the trial court questioned Governor Inslee's council 
as to whether the restrictions were a violation of rights: 
"THE COURT: I understand that. But doesn't it 
restrict the rights of property owners in their remedy that 
they are requesting?" 
The reply from Governor Inslee's council was: 
"MR. COPSEY: Yes, it does. It temporarily 
restricts it. But, again, there is no constitutional right to 
that particular remedy. You know, they are not being 
denied a constitutional access -- or pardon me -- it's not a 
violation of separation of powers because it is not in 
conflict with any procedural rule of the court. It is 
simply imposing a delay on when that action can be 
filed." 
In this reply Inslee's council is arguing for a specific remedy, 
rather than the RIGHT to petition the court for ANY remedy. 
21 

--- Page 27 ---
The court queried Inslee's council regarding the open-
ended nature of the restriction of the prohibition of the right to 
redress. 
"THE COURT: Well, it delays the right to enforce 
their rights under the contract or even be heard by a court 
for over -- well over a year; isn't that right?" 
"MR. COPSEY: Well, in effect, it's turned out to be 
over a year because the proclamation has been updated 
over time, and other -- you know, other -- how do I say --
some of the restrictions have been lessened over time in 
order to better accommodate landlords. Right. There is 
still an eviction moratorium in place." 
Again, the reply first skirts the separation of powers 
argument; and second shows manifest indifference toward the 
landlord's loss of rights with regards to redressing harm. This is 
a direct representation of knowledge of harm and as such 
INTENT to commit unlawful acts. 
Furthermore: 
22 

--- Page 28 ---
"MR. COPSEY: ... And at that time, I forget the 
exact date, it seems to me like it was in place for a 
specified period of time. My memory is 30 days, but, 
again, it's been renewed since then. So that may be less 
significant." 
Governor Jay Inslee's council shows a blatant disregard 
for the length that the unlawful hardship is to be sustained by 
these landlords. 
Additionally, Governor Inslee's council states: 
"MR. COPSEY: ... But in that sense, Your Honor, 
it's really no different than a land use moratorium, where 
there are restrictions ... " 
Here Mr. Copsey clearly makes no distinction between 
land use / zoning and the right of the courts to make their own 
rules. Mr. Copsey's statement also fails to recognize that land 
use it normally applied PRIOR to development rather than to a 
preexisting project, or even to a preexisting contract. Hence 
bears no relevancy to the redress of wrongs. 
23 

--- Page 29 ---
"THE COURT: And so the concept of justice 
delayed is justice denied doesn't apply in this context, Mr. 
Copsey?" 
"MR. COPSEY: That concept, it may -- justice 
may be delayed. I would question whether it's denied. 
But I would say that the way this moratorium was issued 
is not a violation of the separation of powers." 
Notice that Council for Governor Inslee first tries to shift focus 
to cast this as a land use issue. When that loses traction, he falls 
back on to separation of powers, and fails in both arguments. In 
fact, JUSTICE is delayed by violating the doctrine of separation 
of powers, and rather than even a "delay", this continues to this 
day. When an INJUSTICE continues without a foreseeable 
end, it is essentially permanent. 
Judge Carol Murphy ERRED when she entered the 
following decision: 
"The Governor had information, some of which is 
in this record, that justified the temporary restrictions. 
We all recognize that the restrictions continued multiple 
times beyond what was expected to be temporary." And 
24 

--- Page 30 ---
"Although certain unlawful detainer actions and not all 
are restricted, the charges here have not shown a 
violation of separation of powers, the commission of an 
unlawful or unconstitutional act or an intent to violate the 
law or the constitution." 
In these statements Judge Murphy mistakenly seems to think 
that it is within her purview to determine "guilt" or "innocence" 
or "justification" or not, rather than simply to determine 
whether there is sufficiency. In fact, by the exchange between 
Judge Murphy and Mr. Copsey, there is clearly sufficiency to 
allow the voters to make this determination. 
b. Governor Showed Intent. Let the voters 
decide. 
Governor Jay Inslee KNEW or should have known that 
his actions were lawless. Knowing this while proceeding, 
shows his intent to commit this lawless act. State v. Williams, 
148 P.3d 993 (2006). 
25 

--- Page 31 ---
When Governor Inslee issued emergency proclamation 
20-19: 
"Residential landlords are prohibited from 
initiating judicial action seeking a writ of 
restitution involving a dwelling unit if the alleged 
basis for the writ is the failure of the tenant or 
tenants to timely pay rent. This prohibition 
includes, but is not limited to, an action under 
Chapters 59.12 or RCW 59.18 RCW." 
He made it clear that he was prohibiting "judicial action 
seeking a writ of restitution", this shows specific intent to 
violate a landlord's rights by violating the independence of the 
judiciary. 
Furthermore, when the governor proclaimed: 
"Local law enforcement is prohibited from serving 
or otherwise acting on eviction orders that are 
issued solely for default payment of rent related to 
such property." 
He was additionally changing rules of service, which 
though not required to show violation of separation of powers, 
does show that he did additionally change court rules. 
26 

--- Page 32 ---
The governor states in the premise of Proclamation 20-19 
states: 
"WHEREAS, under RCW 59.12 (Unlawful 
Detainer) and RCW 59.18 (Residential Landlord 
Tenant Act) tenants seeking to avoid default 
judgment in eviction hearings need to appear in 
court in order to avoid losing substantial rights to 
assert defenses or access legal and economic 
. 
d " 
assistance; an ... 
This further shows that he did intend to cause hardship to 
landlords as a reason for violating the independence of the 
judiciary. This also makes the curious argument that by not 
appearing in court "substantial rights will be lost", yet others 
who had needs to access the courts were prevented from in 
person appearing in court. So, some citizens were affected 
differently than others with regards to their rights to access the 
courts. 
27 

--- Page 33 ---
Governor Inslee acted unlawfully and with INTENT 
when he violated separation of powers. The court must let the 
voters decide this action. 
Charge #3: Governor Inslee exceeded statutory 
authority granted in RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending 
the Open Public Meetings Act. 
a. The Charge (#3) is Factually and 
Legally Sufficient 
While RCW 43.06.220 gives a governor the power to 
waive laws, there are fundamental principles of being an 
American that are beyond what is permissible in a free and 
open society. 
Judge Murphy erred when she stated: 
"The court concludes that the First Amendment 
and rights under the First Amendment are very different 
than the Open Public Meetings Act. And even under 
RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), the Open Public Meetings Act 
does not create constitutional rights. There is no 
28 

--- Page 34 ---
constitutional right to attend all meetings covered by the 
Open Public Meetings Act in person." 
The Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA) is a statutory 
right of citizens in the state of Washington, it was never claimed 
to be a constitutional right. But, a citizen's full access to open 
government is a fundamental part of American History and 
tradition, without which we cannot claim to be a free and open 
society. 
The issue here is that the Governor Inslee violated RCW 
43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending regulatory obligations under the 
OPMA, as prescribed in RCW 42.30. More specifically, the 
Governor's suspension of the OPMA violated the People's 
delegation of authority to public servants under the OPMA that 
mandates that the People "insist on remaining informed so that 
they may retain control over the instruments they have created." 
RCW 42.30.010. 
29 

--- Page 35 ---
Proponents noted in the Charges the lack of broadband 
internet throughout the State and noted that for impacted 
individuals, the pandemic created a situation wherein those 
individuals did not have the same access to their government in 
a pre-pandemic world. Proponents offer a Declaration or Mr. 
Justin Carey, who is one of those affected indivi'1uals. (See 
Carey Declaration, attached as Exhibit A.) Mr. Carey attempted 
several times to attend or speak at his local city council 
meetings and was denied access; twice he was denied access 
due to not wearing a facial covering-a violation of his deeply 
held religious beliefs; and at least twice he was unable to access 
the meeting due to technological difficulties. Clearly, Mr. 
Carey's experience demonstrates "a conflict with the rights, 
under the First Amendment. .. of the people to peaceably 
assemble" and to seek redress from his government. 
RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii) (emphasis added.) 
30 

--- Page 36 ---
At issue is does waving the OPMA restrict access to open 
government. In Governor Inslee's Council's defense of the 
waiver, he states: 
"And then third, the proclamation does not limit 
other means of communication. It encourages the use of 
online tools and electronic media to communicate with 
agencies." 
By restricting access to only "online tools and electronic 
media" there is created an elite who will have access to 
government, and a sub-class who will NOT have access to 
government. Online tools and electronic media require 
hardware that is beyond the means of many ofV/ashington's 
citizens, including marginalized minorities, people on limited 
incomes and people who lived in regions that lack adequate 
broadband service. 
The purpose of the OPMA is to permit the public to 
observe all steps in the making of government decisions. 
31 

--- Page 37 ---
Meetings of the university's law school faculty are 
subject to the OPMA, despite the power of the board of regents 
to ultimately overrule the law school faculty's decisions. The 
OPMA entitles the public to be present at all stages of the 
decision-making process. See Cathcart v. Andersen, 85 Wn.2d 
102 (1975) 
A governing body can hold a public Meeting by 
Telephone or Video Conferencing only complies with the 
OPMA when the follow conditions are met: 
AGO 2017 No. 4 -A governing body can hold a public 
meeting by telephone or video conferencing so long as the 
speaker phone or video is: (1) provided at the designated 
meeting place, at the designated meeting time; and (2) 
attending members of the public can hear all 
discussion, 
provide testimony, and otherwise be aware of the governing 
body's steps in taking its official action. 
32 

--- Page 38 ---
RCW 42.30.030 establishes the core OPMA 
requirements: "All meetings of the governing body of a public 
agency shall be open and public and all persons shall be 
permitted to attend any meeting of the governing body of a 
public agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter." A 
"meeting" in the context of the OPMA means a gathering of a 
majority of the governing body "to discuss or act on matters in 
which [the attendees] have a common interest." Citizens All. 
for Prop. Rights Legal Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d 
428, 443, 359 P.3d 753 (2015) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 
1131 (10th ed. 2014)). 
For a "meeting" to occur within the meaning of the 
OPMA, "action" must be taken by a quorum of the governing 
body. RCW 42.30.020( 4); Citizens All. for Prop. Rights Legal 
Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d at 442-43. The term 
"action" is broadly defined in the Act as "the transaction of the 
official business of [the] public agency by [its] governing body 
33 

--- Page 39 ---
including ... receipt of public testimony, deliberations, 
discussions, considerations, reviews, evaluations, and final 
actions." RCW 42.30.020(3). "Thus, within the context of the 
OPMA ... a 'meeting' of a governing body occurs when a 
majority of its members gathers with the collective intent of 
transacting the governing body's business[.]" 
Citizens All. 
for Prop. Rights Legal Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d at 
444. However, the mere passive receipt of electronic 
communication by a member of the governing body does not 
constitute participation in a meeting by that member. Id. 
Open participation in public meetings is considered so 
important that, RCW 42.30.060 provides that actions taken by a 
governing body are "null and void" unless the meeting is open 
to the public and proper notice has been given. 
A further point with regards to the OPMA is that by RCW 
43.30.040 attendance at a public meeting prohibits the 
34 

--- Page 40 ---
governing body from requiring attendees "to register his or her 
name [or] other information, to complete a questionnaire, or 
otherwise to fulfill any condition precedent to his or her 
attendance." Electronic meeting attendance would require 
"registering one's name, IP address and other information." 
b. Intent 
For Governor Inslee to waive the OPMA without 
incurring intent to do a manifest wrong, at the very least, he 
would have to have provided UNIVERSAL access for 
Washington citizens, to teleconferencing software, hardware 
AND a secure room to use this in. 
Open and transparent government is fundamental and 
necessary to ensure a free society, and while the OPMA is not a 
constitutional right per se, it is the foundation of many 
constitutional rights. 
RCW 42.30.010 states it's intent: 
35 

--- Page 41 ---
"The legislature finds and declares that all public 
commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, 
departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of 
this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of 
the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their 
actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be 
conducted openly. 
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to 
the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating 
authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide 
what is good for the people to know and what is not good for 
them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that 
they may retain control over the instruments they have created." 
The language is strong, enough so as to suggest that 
denial of access to government meetings is a loss of personal 
sovereignty to government. RCW 42.30.070 allows in case of 
emergencies, to change the location of the affected meeting. 
36 

--- Page 42 ---
Generally emergencies are classified as fire, flood, earthquake, 
or other emergency, though by the litany test there is no 
inference that pandemic is among these reasons. Even if an 
emergency forces the change of a meeting location, the public 
still has the right to attend. 
In waving the OPMA, at the least restricting access to 
public meetings, the Governor KNOWLINGLY prevented 
transparency to the actions of government and KNOWLINGLY 
prevented citizens, and an overwhelmingly certain classes of 
citizens (rural residents, lower income, the disal:led and 
minorities), their access to government. 
Charge #4: RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii) 
a. The Charge is Factually and Legally 
Sufficient 
On April 6, 2020, Rebecca Faust, a resident of Thurston 
County submitted an application for a permit to the Department 
of Enterprise Services (DES), of the State of Washington. To 
37 

--- Page 43 ---
hold a rally, called "Rally for Rights", to advocate for freedom 
and disability rights. The rally was to be held on May 1, 2020. 
The DES informed Ms. Faust that due to Governor 
Inslee's emergency proclamation her permit for a rally, which is 
freedom of assemble and protected by RCW 
43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), was denied. 
Ms. Faust appealed this decision, as it is cer right to 
appeal an administrative decision, to Chris Liu, Director of 
DES via email, and also sent the email via "cc" to Governor Jay 
Inslee and Kathryn Leathers (one of Governor Inslee's aids). 
Chris Liu's reply to Ms. Faust was that due to Governor 
Inslee's "Stay Home Stay safe" Proclamation that public rallies 
( even political) were banned. 
Governor Inslee's proclamation threatened criminal 
punishment for the exercise of both free speech and freedom of 
assembly. RCW 43.06.220(5). 
Further noted is that the event was planned for the 
38 

--- Page 44 ---
Capitol Campus, which is outside, and for which there is no 
SCIENCE that shows any health risk to outdoor gatherings. 
The revisions of the emergency statute had the intent to 
specifically limit the scope of these powers. WLile the bill SB 
5260 recognizes that the Governor has broad authority to wave 
or suspend statuary obligation, Section (2)(g)(iii) protects the 
fundamental rights of freedom of speech and assembly. 
This charge is substantial and not frivolous. It is a clear 
assault on very specific emergency powers. 
b. Intent 
Knowingly undertaking an unlawful act is general intent. 
When Governor Inslee made the proclamation, and the 
underlying direction to Department of Enterprise Services to 
prevent the issuance of permits for public (political) assembly, 
Governor Inslee knowingly violated RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(III). 
On May 21, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law 
SB 5260, which added the language: 
39 

--- Page 45 ---
"(g) Such other statutory and regulatory ooligations or 
limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state 
business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency 
if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, 
rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay 
necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) 
authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory 
obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another 
statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would 
conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed 
condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) 
the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under 
the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to 
peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as 
practical to legislative leadership and impacted local 
governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g)." 
40 

--- Page 46 ---
While the right to free speech and the right to freedom of 
assembly are codified in the Bill of Rights and as such are 
constitutional principles, our charges do not focus on the 
fundamental constitutional aspect, but rather the statutory 
aspect. By knowingly violating a state statute, which he signed 
into law, the Governor at the very least demonstrated general 
intent to act lawlessly. 
Furthermore, with the evidence introduced in the Faust 
affidavit it indicates that the Governor's acts were even 
specifically directed to limit assembly of people with 
disabilities. It can further be noted that while the Governor's 
actions restricted freedom of assembly to conservative groups 
he did not take actions against Marxist groups such as AntiFA 
and BLM, who we free to commit violence in Seattle, Olympia 
and elsewhere, including on the Capitol Campus. 
41 

--- Page 47 ---
By knowingly violating the state statute RCW 
43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), Governor Inslee committed an unlawful 
act with general intent. It is not the purview of the court to 
decide innocence or guilt, only to recognize that this charge is 
NOT frivolous and is substantial. It is for the voters to decide 
the outcome. 
Charge #5: Violation RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) 
a. The Charge (#5) is Factually and 
Legally Sufficient 
April 25, 1969, the Washington State Legislature passed 
Senate Bill SB 392 (as referenced in the original argument for 
Charge #5). The final version of the bill allowed the governor 
to declare a state of emergency for the following 3 reasons: 
public disorder, disaster or riot. At issue in Charge #5 is does 
the governor have a statuary permission to issue a declaration of 
emergency for a medical pandemic. 
42 

--- Page 48 ---
Prior to the final version of the original bill, the reasons 
for an emergency declaration were far more limited, and 
focused entirely on civil unrest and criminal acts of violence 
and property damage. 
Senate Bill SB 392: Section (12): 
( (He may control or suppress riots or unlw.vful strikes, or 
any unlawful assembly of ten or more persons, 1,,vhen by such 
riot, unlw.:vful strike, or unlaw:ful assembly any persons are 
attempting to commit a felony, or inciting others to commit 
such crime, or any person or persons are in imminent danger of 
losing either life or property. Before taking any such action, the 
governor shall first notify and request the local authorities to 
suppress such riot, unlawful strike, or unlmvful assembly, and if 
they fail, refuse, neglect, or are unable to do so, he shall issue 
his proclamation commanding relation to acts and duties to be 
performed by others towards him, extends to the person 
performing for the time being the duties of governor)) 
He may, after finding that public disorder, disaster or riot 
exists within this state or any part thereof which affects life, 
health, property or the public peace, proclaim a state of 
emergency in the area affected and the powers granted him 
during a state of emergency shall be effective only within the 
area described in the proclamation. 
43 

--- Page 49 ---
Understanding the backdrop of the times gives greater 
insight into the thinking of the legislature and what their intent 
was regarding the declaration of emergency powers. 
On July 28, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson 
organized the National Advisory Commission on Civil 
Disorders to investigate the urban rebellions erupting in cities 
across the nation, between 1964 and 1967. The findings of the 
seven-month study were published in March of 1968, ( a year 
before passage of Washington State's Emergency Powers 
Statute.) 
Martin Luther King Jr., an African-American clergyman 
and civil rights leader, was fatally shot at the Lorraine Motel in 
Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Prior to this Memphis 
Sanitation workers staged a walkout, on February 11, 1968, to 
protest unequal wages and working conditions. Recall that the 
original Washington emergency statute allowed for an 
emergency declaration for an unlawful strike action. 
44 

--- Page 50 ---
On July 29, 1968, seven Seattle policemen and two 
civilians are wounded by gunfire and rocks during a Central 
Area riot prompted by a police raid on the Seattle office of the 
Black Panther Party. 
"On March 26, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-
1968) (D-NY), meets enthusiastic crowds in Seattle as he 
campaigns for the Democratic nomination for President of 
the United States. Speaking to more than 10,000 people 
at the University of Washington ... 
On March 31, 1968, President Johnson announced to the 
nation that he would not seek nor would he accept his party's 
nomination for president. 
On June 4, 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy was shot by an 
assassin in Los Angeles ... " 
The 1960s were without a doubt very violent times, 
plagued by civil unrest ( or public disorder and riot.) There is 
little doubt that the Washington state legislature was focused on 
45 

--- Page 51 ---
these issues with regards to setting the reasons for declaring 
emergency powers. But a further question remains, that being 
the idea of medical emergency. Could the legislature have 
simply "forgotten" to consider medical emergency? Had it 
been so long since there was a medical emergency in the United 
States that it was not relevant? NO! In fact, September 1968 
was the start of the H3N2 pandemic (or Hong Kong Flu). The 
pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus 
comprised of two genes from an avian influenza A virus, 
including a new H3 hemagglutinin, but also contained the N2 
neuraminidase from the 1957 H2N2 virus. 
The estimated number of deaths was one million 
(1,000,000) worldwide and about one hundred thousand 
(100,000) in the United States. Most deaths were in people 
aged 65 years and older. In Washington state, the peak effect of 
the virus was December 14, 1968. So, the effect of the H3N2 
virus was very much in the forefront of current events when 
46 

--- Page 52 ---
SB 392 was being debated, yet there is no mention of medical 
emergency in the bill as a reason for a state of emergency. 
The statute for declaring an emergency was updated 
again in the 1970s to add, "energy emergency" to the list of 
reasons for declaring an emergency, and still no addition of 
"medical emergency". As Justice Antonin Scalia said, "[a law] 
says what it says and doesn't say what it doesn't say". 
When determining the meaning of what a disaster is, we 
must use "history and tradition". Since 1968 there have been 
eight governors, and until Governor Inslee, not one of them felt 
that a disaster could be interpreted as a medical pandemic. Not 
during the Hong Kong Flu A of 1969, nor the Russian Flu of 
1977, nor any other of the pandemics that have occurred over 
the years. In fact, every other governor UNDERSTOOD that a 
disaster meant NATURAL disaster. They also understood that 
declaring a state of emergency was an extreme act that had to 
be exercised with caution. This is evidenced by the relatively 
47 

--- Page 53 ---
few emergency declarations over the years. Every disaster until 
Governor Inslee was due to floods, fires, a volcano eruption or 
extreme weather. 
What follows is a list of governors since 1970, the 
number of emergencies that they declared, and the reason. In 
every case it was a disaster, a natural disaster. 
Dan Evans, 1965-1977, 1 emergency order, 
Disaster/flooding. 
Dixie Lee Ray, 1977-1981, 1 emergency order, 
Disaster/volcano. 
John Spellman, 1981-1985, 0 Emergency orders. 
Booth Gardner, 1985-1993, 0 Emergency orders. 
Mike Lowry, 1993-1997, 0 Emergency orders. 
Gary Locke, 1997- 2005, 1 Emergency order, 
Disaster/Flooding. 
Christine Gregoire, 2005- 2013, 2 Emergency orders, 
Disaster/Flooding. 
48 

--- Page 54 ---
Both legal and factual sufficiency is overwhelming. The 
court's responsibility is limited. It is not the privilege of the 
court to make a determination as to guilt or innocence, only to 
be the gatekeeper, to prevent frivolous charges. This charge is 
far from frivolous and is robust with substantial reasoning. 
With so much to consider it is right for the people to evaluate 
all of the evidence and make their own decision. 
b. Intent: The voters Should Decide the Validity 
of Governor's Exercise of Emergency Power for a Medical 
Situation, themselves. 
Governor Inslee contends (in the trial court), that the: " ... 
the legislature confirmed its intent to provide broad authority to 
the governor to proclaim a state of emergency under Chapter 46 
RCW prior to the pandemic, and it ratified the proclamations 
that the governor issued in the exercise of his emergency 
authority during the pandemic after the fact." 
49 

--- Page 55 ---
But this is in error for two reasons. First, the history and 
tradition of the legislature has not defined emergency powers 
broadly, they have in fact made the reasons for emergency 
declarations rather narrow, with only for reasons specified, 
stated above, and none of such reasons include medical 
situations. 
Second, a recall is a vehicle of the people, not 
specifically of the legislature. Even though the legislature 
failed to end the Governor's state of emergency, that is not 
reason to prevent a recall from proceeding. This is a factual 
dispute over the meaning of what reasons the Governor may 
declare a state of emergency, which must be decided by the 
voters. 
Governor Inslee's brief in Section F cites the case, 
Cougar, 97 Wn.2d at 474, in which Governor Dixie Lee Ray 
declared a state of emergency, a NATURAL DISASTER, in 
regards to a potential eruption of Mt. St. Helens. In the Cougar 
50 

--- Page 56 ---
case it was the timing of the declaration that was in despite. 
The question was did Governor Ray have the authority to 
declare an emergency for a natural disaster BEFORE the 
eruption or only after. The court held that a governor had broad 
power as to WHEN to declare an emergency, but made no 
comment what reasons were acceptable for such a declaration. 
As stated above we assert that a NATURAL DISASTER is a 
valid reason for an emergency declaration, the Cougar case 
affirms our belief that, "disaster" means "natural disaster". 
Further stated in the Cougar case, "In times of natural 
catastrophe or civil disorder, immediate and decisive action by 
some component of state government is essential." It is 
clarified that disaster means "natural Catastrophe". 
In our recall, the notion of legislative police powers does not 
relate, as we contend that there was no authority to declare an 
emergency in the first place.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In 1913 the citizens of Washington passed a 
constitutional amendment that became Article I, §§ 33-34, of 
the Washington State Constitution, giving the citizens a broad 
right of recall, for all elected offices [ except judges]. This 
recall process allowed 25% of the voters within any jurisdiction 
to place on the ballot a demand for recall of a public official 
within that jurisdiction. Over the years the courts took on the 
roll as a gateway to insure minimal legal and factual sufficiency 
of the recall petitions and to protect public officials from 
harassment thought frivolous and unsubstantiated charges. The 
court has a limited roll and it is left for the voters to make the 
decision based on the evidence. 
This day and time when many of our public institutional 
are losing the faith of the electorate, it is even more important 
to respect the constitutional rights of the voters. Confidence in 
our executive, legislative and judicial process is at an all-time

low. It is now, more than ever, vital to allow the voters to 
decide, where it is the constitutional prerogative to do so. 
Petitioners C Davis, et al, respectfully requests this court 
to recognize the sufficiency of the charges. The court should 
order the Superior Court to approve a Ballot Synopsis for 
Charges #2 thru #5 and permit these matters to proceed 
expeditiously to the voters as provided under the Washington 
State Constitution and State Law. 
Pursuant to RAP 18.17, I hereby certify there are 783 0 words in 
this brief as indicated by the word processing program used.
