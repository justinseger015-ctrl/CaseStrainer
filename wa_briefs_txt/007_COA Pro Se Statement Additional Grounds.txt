CASE# 370194 
State of Washington v. Joseph Mario Zamora 
GRANT COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT No. 181002632 
Dear Appellant: 
Your attorney has filed a proof of service indicating that you were mailed a copy of the opening 
brief in your appeal. If, after reviewing that brief, you believe there are additional grounds for 
review that were not included in your lawyer's brief, you may list those grounds in a Statement 
of Additional Grounds for Review. RAP 10.10. 
Because the Statement of Additional Grounds for Review is not a brief, there is no required 
format except the provisions contained in General Rule 14 and you may prepare it by hand. No 
citations to the record or legal authority are required, but you should sufficiently identify any 
alleged error so that the appellate court may consider your argument. A copy of the rule is 
enclosed for your reference. 
Your Statement of Additional Grounds for Review must be sent to the Court within 30 days. It 
will be reviewed by the Court when your appeal is considered on the merits.
