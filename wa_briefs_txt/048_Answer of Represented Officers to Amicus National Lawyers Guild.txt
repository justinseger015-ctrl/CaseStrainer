I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The current case before this Court arises from requests 
under the Washington Public Records Act (“PRA”) pertaining to 
an investigation by the City of Seattle’s Office of Police 
Accountability (“OPA”).  These requests sought the whereabouts 
of six (6) off duty Seattle Police Officers on January 6, 2021 and 
their activities at ex-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal 
Rally”.  On March 10, 2021, the trial court declined to issue a 
preliminary injunction preventing release of OPA’s records 
before it completed its investigation.  CP 399-404.  This appeal 
ensued.  
In early July 2021, after the completion of their 
comprehensive investigation, OPA made its findings public 
during the pendency of this appeal (“OPA Summary”) by issuing 
a 21-page report.  See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1.  In summary, 
no sanction was recommended as to these four Officers 
represented by the undersigned (“Represented Officers”).  

--- Page 7 ---
-2- 
The OPA unequivocally recognized the Represented 
Officers’ Constitutional right to attend a political demonstration 
while off duty.  The OPA could not have been any clearer: these 
Represented Officers did not commit any misconduct, participate 
in any insurrection, and they were fit to continue serving as 
Seattle Police Officers without sanction.  The OPA issued its 
determination while fully recognizing “the political and factual 
views espoused at the rally were antithetical to the beliefs of a 
strong majority of the Seattle community.”  Id. at p. 20.  Indeed, 
Andrew Myerberg, Director of the Office of Police 
Accountability virtuously recognized this Constitutional right, 
even if he “as the decider in this matter, disagree vehemently 
with everything the rally stood for.”  Id.    
Reviewing the facts today in October 2021, after the 
release of the OPA Summary—as well as after taking judicial 
notice of considerable press attention and the submission of 
inflammatory and reckless Amicus Curiae—the facts and issues 
of this case have not only crystalized.  The facts have 

--- Page 8 ---
-3- 
fundamentally changed from the March 2021 TRO hearing. 
These developments have strengthened the Represented 
Officers’ Constitutional position prohibiting disclosure.   
Specifically, here, the intentionally incitive Brief of 
Amicus Curiae The National Lawyers Guild Inc. (“NLG Brief”) 
does not change the fact that the Represented Officers’ First 
Amendment Constitutional rights supersede the PRA’s 
disclosure presumption.   
II. RESPONSE TO ISSUES OF CONCERN TO NLG 
BRIEF  
 
1. 
With the July 2021 release of the full OPA 
Summary and the names of the Police Officers who committed 
misconduct, there is now no “compelling government or public 
interest” in disclosing the names of the Represented Officers who 
were cleared of any misconduct. 
2. 
The First Amendment to Constitution supersedes 
the PRA and protects the Represented Officers against public 
disclosure of their names.   

--- Page 9 ---
-4- 
III. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE  
 
 
The Represented Officers hereby reincorporate the facts 
contained in their Supplemental Brief filed on September 30, 
2021, pp. 2-5.   
IV.   ARGUMENT  
 
Nobody denies that an element of the crowd that 
assembled on January 6, 2021 failed to assemble peacefully and, 
instead, proceeded to advance on the Capitol in a horrific riot.   
Indeed, two (2) Seattle Police officers (“Unrepresented 
Officers”) were deemed to have trespassed on U.S. Capitol 
grounds.   The OPA Summary found these two (2) Unrepresented 
Officers to have committed misconduct. They were subsequently 
terminated.  See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1, pp. 1, 15-18.  Their 
names have been released.1  They are not the Represented 
Officers.   
 
1 2 Seattle cops who were at US Capitol in January are fired (apnews.com) at 
https://apnews.com/article/seattle-police-reform-da98b06a9245d496204bf13e7b32ca90 

--- Page 10 ---
-5- 
However, the public OPA Summary determined that the 
four (4) Represented Officers did assemble peacefully, broke no 
laws whatsoever, did not participate in any riot, and, ultimately, 
“that the officers attended this rally is absolutely protected by the 
Constitution.”  Id. at p. 20.  Here, these very Constitutional rights 
of speech, petition, and peaceful assembly supersede any PRA 
predisposition to disclose the Represented Officers’ identities.  
This is because disclosure of their names would lead to, inter 
alia, harassment and a “chilling effect” upon the Officers’ First 
Amendment Constitutional rights—the actual standard this 
Court should apply when evaluating this case.  See Dream 
Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 384 F.3d 990, 1012 (9th Cir. 2004). 
1. The Represented Officers Constitutional Rights 
Supersede the PRA 
At the outset, the PRA “must give way to constitutional 
mandate.”  Freedom Found. v. Gregoire, 178 Wn.2d 686, 695, 
310 P.3d 1252 (2013) (citation omitted).  As such, the PRA’s 
catch-all “other statutes” exemption incorporates any protections 
afforded by the Washington or United States Constitutions.  Id.; 

--- Page 11 ---
-6- 
see also Seattle Times Co. v. Serko, 170 Wn.2d 581, 594-97, 243 
P.3d 919 (2010) (discussing how constitutional fair trial rights 
may serve as an exemption under the PRA); Yakima County v. 
Yakima Herald–Republic, 170 Wn.2d 775, 808, 246 P.3d 768 
(2011) (noting in dictum that the argument that constitutional 
provisions can serve as PRA exemptions “has force”). 
As recognized by the OPA Summary, and basic 
Constitutional knowledge, public picketing and protesting is free 
speech in and of itself.  Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 
Ala., 394 U.S. 147, 152, 89 S. Ct. 935, 939, 22 L. Ed. 2d 162 
(1969).  Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has 
repeatedly recognized a right to remain anonymous, yet active 
and in plain sight in the context of First Amendment protected 
activity.  As Justice Stevens observed in Watchtower Bible, 536 
U.S. 150, 166, 122 S. Ct. 2080, 2089, 153 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2002), 
a Jehovah Witness proselytizing door-to-door, in public, still 
retained a right to anonymity.  Id. (“…there are a significant 
number of persons who support causes anonymously… 

--- Page 12 ---
-7- 
anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official 
retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a 
desire to preserve as much of one’s privacy as possible”).  The 
same right to be anonymous, yet active and in plain sight, applies 
to political speech and association.  See e.g. Talley v. California, 
362 U.S. 60, 64, 80 S.Ct. 536, 538, 4 L.Ed.2d 559 (1960) 
(holding First Amendment protects the anonymous distribution 
of unsigned handbills); McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 
U.S. 334, 342, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995) 
(holding similarly to Talley); Nat'l Ass’n for Advancement of 
Colored People v. State of Ala. ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 
462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958) (privacy in 
group association may be indispensable to preservation of 
freedom of association). 
Quite simply, if one can prove that “constitutional 
principles provide [them] with a constitutional privilege [then a] 
PRA claim must fail”.  Freedom Found, 178 Wn.2d at 695.  
Here, since there is a clear First Amendment right being 

--- Page 13 ---
-8- 
exercised, and no compelling interest identified, the PRA must 
give way to the Constitutional rights of the Represented Officers 
to remain anonymous and not have their activities “chilled.”   
2. NLG Amici’s Defamatory and Reckless Attempt to 
Establish a “Compelling Interest” Only Serves to 
Support Plaintiffs’ Need For First Amendment 
Protections   
The public OPA Summary cleared the Represented 
Officers and deemed them fit to continue to serve.  This report 
fully details the OPA’s investigative process, the evidence 
gathered and reviewed, the ultimate decision finding no 
misconduct, and the rationale behind that determination. 
Unfortunately, reading the NLG Brief, it is almost certain 
the NLG Amici went ahead and filed without reading the OPA 
Summary.  For instance, the NLG Amici consistently (i) 
references six (6) officers, when there are only four (4) officers 
being represented2, (ii) demand “disclosure of… administrative 
proceedings” when the OPA Summary has already been 
 
2 NLG Brief at p. 18. 

--- Page 14 ---
-9- 
released3, and (iii) state the unrefuted point that criminal acts take 
one outside the ambit of First Amendment, when it is clear the 
Represented Officers committed no crime.4   Even if the NLG 
Amici read the OPA Summary, which is hard to believe, the 
NLG Brief does not discuss the OPA Summary even one time.  
This glaring omission discredits the NLG Brief at the outset 
rendering many of its points moot, if not recklessly misleading.         
a. The NLG Amici Pejoratively Assert a Reckless 
Unsubstantiated 
Narrative 
against 
the 
Represented Officers Without Any Support.   
The NLG Brief states that the “general public” has a 
compelling interest in knowing the identities of “white 
supremacist—affiliated police officers.”5  The NLG Brief then 
churns through a series of news articles and reports all related to 
a deplorable list of racist Facebook posts, emails, texts, videos, 
and other actions by police officers.  The NLG Brief then 
discusses distressing statistics regarding how race plays into 
 
3 Id. at p. 23. 
4 Id. at p. 29. 
5 Id. at pp. 4-5. 

--- Page 15 ---
-10- 
wrongful arrests and convictions.6  Finally, the NLG Brief goes 
over the alarming disparity in deaths by race at the hands of 
police.7  This is all disgusting and horrifying.  The NLG Brief 
concludes their meta-conglomeration—purposely written to 
shock the conscious of any reader—by stating:  
The issue of white supremacy in policing leads to 
worse outcomes for Black, Indigenous, and other 
people of color than their white counterparts, and 
non-white citizens should be armed with at least the 
knowledge of which officers are more likely to be 
dangerous than others.  This Court, viewing the 
appeal in light of these distressing and well 
documented facts, should find a compelling public 
informational interest in disclosure of the identities 
and administrative proceedings pertaining to the 
police officer plaintiffs who chose to associate with 
avowed white supremacist at the January 6, “Stop 
the Steal” rally. 
 
See NLG Brief at p. 6. 
 
However, there is a large shameless hole in the NLG Brief.  
The NLG Brief attributes all these horrible things—wanton racist 
texts and emails, wrongful racist arrests, racist convictions, and 
 
6 Id. at pp. 10-12, 14-15, 18-19. 
7 Id. at p. 20. 

--- Page 16 ---
-11- 
even civilian deaths—to these four (4) Represented Officers who 
the NLG Amici know nothing about. 
The OPA Summary states the only thing that these the 
Represented Officers did do which was attend “a political rally 
in support of a President who was and is still reviled by many in 
Seattle and that was in furtherance of a theory of election fraud 
that was, at best, discredited and, at worst, knowingly 
fabricated.”  See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1, p. 20.  These are 
the only facts that the NLG Amici, or anyone else, actually know 
about the Represented Officers. 
Thus, before smearing these Represented Officers as 
racists with guns merely for supporting ex-President Donald 
Trump and his discredited theories, the NLG Amici should have 
looked out their cloister’s window (or connected to the internet) 
and they would have easily learned: 
• 74,224,319 people voted for Donald Trump in 2020, 
which is 46.9% of all votes cast.8

• Donald Trump received over 30% of the Latino vote.10 
 
• One third of all Americans believe that election fraud cost 
Donald Trump the election11 
 
While the NLG Amici can assert that everyone who 
supported Donald Trump is an incorrigible racist, that position 
cannot be supported by tens of millions of racial minorities who 
voted for Donald Trump.  And, if the NLG Amici allege that only 
vile racists believe the election was stolen, even with this 
narrower subset, NLG Amici’s math is such that over 68,000,000 
voting age Americans are white supremacists who support 
racially based wrongful convictions and police-caused deaths. 12

-13- 
Moreover, contrary to the incendiary assertions in the 
NLG Brief, the January 6, 2021 “Stop the Steal” rally was not 
about race or white supremacy.  In all of their dangerously 
assumptive diatribe against the Represented Officers, the NLG 
Amici point to no statement calling for racists to assemble on 
January 6, 2021 to celebrate white supremacy, undertake racist 
acts, or cheer on extra-judicial minority arrests and killings. 
There is no doubt the speakers at the “Stop the Steal” rally 
podium spewed all sundry of discredited theories on January 6, 
2021.  However, not even the NLG Brief is reckless enough to 
assert that even one speaker on the podium asserted any racist or 
white supremacist language to the crowd before it. 
Thus, in the end, the NLG Amici offer nothing to this 
Court to show that these off duty Represented Officers did 
anything but attend a politically unpopular rally—under the 
belief that election fraud caused their favored candidate to lose 
the election.  This is not a crime.  This is not white supremacy.  
This does not lead to extra-judicial racist arrests and deaths. 

--- Page 19 ---
-14- 
The politically accountable leaders of Seattle’s democratic 
institutions established the OPA to investigate claims of 
misconduct and make determinations.  Here the OPA found the 
Represented Officers’ lawful off duty attendance was within 
their First Amendment rights—even as those rights may be more 
narrow for public employees and even narrower for police 
officers.   
Perhaps before filing their inflammatory brief, the NLG 
Amici should have reflected on the OPA Summary’s principled 
assessment of what the Represented Officers actually did and the 
principled reason why no misconduct was found: 
However, absent any acts on their part that were 
illegal, that the officers attended this rally is 
absolutely protected by the Constitution. These 
officers were entitled to exercise their freedom of 
expression and to assemble. That they did so in a 
manner contrary to the majority view in Seattle does 
not alter this view. This is the case even if I, as the 
decider in this matter, disagree vehemently with 
everything the rally stood for. 
 
Any contrary result would be incorrect–both 
constitutionally and morally–and would undermine 
the rule of law that is the bedrock of our society. It 

--- Page 20 ---
-15- 
would also serve to speed up the current decline of 
reason, objectivity, and fundamental fairness that 
plagues America and its contemporary collective 
discourse. To OPA, that would be simply 
unpalatable and unacceptable. While this decision 
may be unpopular with some, OPA believes that it 
is supported by the law and is consistent with due 
process. 
 
See OPA Summary at p. 21. 
 
 
In the end, there is no “compelling interest” here to root 
out “white supremacists” by exposing the identities of these 
Represented Officers because the NLG Amici have not proven 
that any of these Represented Officers are “white supremacists,” 
or, even, that the “Stop the Steal” rally, discredited as it may be, 
was about white supremacy at all.   
3. Amici’s Constitutional Analysis Does Not Account 
For The Facts Before This Court 
 
a. The Represented Officers’ Briefed Their 
Constitutional 
Argument 
and 
Appropriate 
Standard  
Contrary to the NLG Brief’s assertion, the Represented 
Officers briefed their First Amendment Constitutional arguments 
and standard for this Court to evaluate. 

--- Page 21 ---
-16- 
First, the Represented Officers’ Complaint clearly alleged 
a First Amendment Constitutional basis to prevent release of 
their identity due to their free speech, assembly, association, and 
petition rights.  See CP 12-13, §F “Disclosure of the Except 
Information Would Violate Plaintiff’s Constitutional Rights”, 
The First Amendment Constitutional basis which supersedes the 
PRA was again asserted in Plaintiffs Motion For Temporary 
Restraining Order.  See CP 52-53.  Finally, the same basis was 
once again asserted in the Appellants Opening Brief.  See App. 
Opening Br. at pp. 28-29.  The Appellants Opening Brief also 
included the appropriate standard this Court should apply when 
evaluating whether First Amendment rights supersede disclosure 
pursuant the PRA.13 This was, again, repeated in the Appellants’ 
Supplemental Briefing at pp. 16-18.  Thus, it is only the NLG 
 
13 See Appellant’s Opening Brief at p. 28 (“A proposed PRA production infringing on First 
Amendment rights must enjoined where the party enjoining where the party opposing the 
production shows “a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of personal 
information will subject those individuals or groups of individuals to threats, harassment, 
or reprisals’ that would have a chilling effect on that activity.”).   

--- Page 22 ---
-17- 
Brief that fails to address the relevant standards and case law—
as fully explained below.  
b. NLG Amici Do Not Discuss the Most Relevant 
Cases or Properly Explain How A Court 
Evaluates First Amendment Challenges to a 
PRA Disclosure    
 
i. 
Doe v. Reed has definite, but limited, 
value to this Court 
 
The NLG Brief discusses Doe v. Reed at length.  John Doe 
No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 200, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 2820, 177 
L.Ed.2d 493 (2010).  The Represented Officers believe that Doe 
v. Reed has some applicability to establish that Courts have not 
hesitated to prohibit PRA disclosures on First Amendment 
grounds, if those resisting disclosure can show “a reasonable 
probability that the compelled disclosure [of personal 
information] will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals 
from either Government officials or private parties.”  Id. at 200.   
However, Doe v. Reed is of limited applicability here.  Moreover, 
the NLG Brief ignores what the Doe v. Reed case ruled upon—
and what the case forwent ruling upon. 

--- Page 23 ---
-18- 
The Doe v. Reed Court ultimately determined they were 
called to decide only a facial challenge to whether the PRA could 
apply to compelled disclosure of signatory names on all petitions 
in Washington.  In short, the Doe v. Reed Plaintiffs would 
ultimately seek an injunction barring the secretary of state “from 
making referendum petitions available to the public.”  Id. at 194.  
The Court stated “[the Plaintiffs] must therefore satisfy our 
standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.”  Id. 
at 194.  The Court ultimately ruled that as a facial challenge the 
disclosure of “referendum petitions in general” under the PRA 
“would not violate the First Amendment.”  Id. at 202.  
However, as the NLG Brief fails to discuss, Doe v. Reed 
did not determine a narrow “as-applied” analysis to the specific 
petition and referendum R-71 at issue.  Indeed, that Court stated: 
The issue at this stage of the case is not whether 
disclosure of this particular petition would violate 
the First Amendment, but whether disclosure of 
referendum petitions in general would do so….We 
leave it to the lower courts to consider in the first 
instance the signers' more focused claim concerning 

--- Page 24 ---
-19- 
disclosure of the information on this particular 
petition, which is pending before the District Court. 
 
John Doe No. 1 v. Reed at 191 (emphasis added)  
 
 
Even the venerable Sam Reed, the then-Secretary of State 
in Washington, “acknowledge[d] that plaintiffs may press the 
narrower challenge [as applied to R-71 specifically] in 
proceedings pending before the District Court.”  Id. at 202.  In 
other words, the actual litigated issue in that case – whether 
disclosure of R-71’s signatories’ information under the PRA 
would violate the signatories’ First Amendment Constitutional 
rights – was never decided by Doe v. Reed. 
The only issue that Doe v. Reed decided was that there was 
no broad facial reason to prevent petition signatories’ names—in 
all situations—from being released to third parties under the 
PRA.  Much of the general discussion in Doe v. Reed discussed 
the signatories’ rights vis-à-vis a compelling government interest 
in strengthening the actual referendum process.  For example, 
public disclosure helps to root out fraud, bureaucratic mistakes, 

--- Page 25 ---
-20- 
and bolsters accountability in the referendum process.  Id. at 
199.14  The Doe v. Reed Court also acknowledged that many 
referendums would not engender strong emotions because  
typical referendum petitions “concern tax policy, revenue, 
budget, or other state law issues,” which would have much less 
of an impact upon signatories’ willingness to participate.  Id. at 
200. 
Ultimately, Doe v. Reed is of some, but limited, 
instructiveness here.  First, it establishes First Amendment 
Rights can, in fact, supersede the PRA.  Second, it articulates the 
standard for ruling when First Amendment Rights supersede the 
PRA disclosure mandate which is described more fully below.  
ii. 
Instead of relying on Doe v. Reed, this 
Court should look to truly instructive First 
Amendment Expression cases  
 
The standard set forth in Doe v. Reed as applied to 
expressive First Amendment speech is set forth in case law–and 
 
14 Doe v. Reed at 199 (“Public disclosure thus helps ensure that the only signatures counted 
are those that should be, and that the only referenda placed on the ballot are those that 
garner enough valid signatures. Public disclosure also promotes transparency and 
accountability in the electoral process to an extent other measures cannot.”)

was addressed in Appellants’ Opening Brief and Appellants 
Supplemental Briefing.15  Dream Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 
384 F.3d 990, 1012 (9th Cir. 2004); Does 1-10 v. Univ. of 
Washington, 798 F. App’x 1009, 1010 (9th Cir. 2020); Roe v.

(W.D. Wash. Aug. 10, 2015). 
In Dream Palace, the 9th Circuit recognized the 
established precedent that adult erotic dancing is a form of First 
Amendment expression.  Dream Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 384 
F.3d 990, 998 (9th Cir. 2004).  As such, while the dancers could 
be compelled to provide their personal information to Arizona 
because that did not “inhibit[ ] the ability or the inclination to 
engage in the protected expression,” that did not mean that 
Arizona could then turn around provide that information to the 
public without infringing on those dancers First Amendment 
rights.  Id. at 1010.  Dream Palace states as follows: 
The First Amendment does not permit the county to 
put 
employees 
of 
adult 
entertainment

establishments to the choice of either applying for a 
permit to engage in protected expression in 
circumstances where they expose themselves to 
“unwelcome harassment from aggressive suitors 
and overzealous opponents” of such activity or of 
choosing not to engage in such activity out of 
concern for their personal safety. The chilling effect 
on those wishing to engage in First Amendment 
activity is obvious. Given the choice with which 
they are faced, we think it likely that those willing 
to engage in such activity will decline to do so… 
 
Dream Palace at 1012.   
 
This same sort of analysis and standard appears in other 
Courts.  While reporting information relating to one’s First 
Amendment activities to the government does not sufficiently 
impinge on First Amendment rights pursuant to an O’Brien 
Constitutional analysis, the government’s subsequent disclosure 
of that same information to the public pursuant to a public 
records act request does impermissibly impinge on First 
Amendment rights.16  See e.g., Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. 
 
16 Regulations that are unrelated to the content of speech are subject to an intermediate 
level of scrutiny which was first enunciated as a four-step test in United States v. 
O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).  Government regulation 
of conduct is sufficiently justified if it is within constitutional power of government; if it 
furthers important or substantial governmental interest; if governmental interest is

Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty., Tennessee, 274 F.3d 
377, 395 (6th Cir. 2001) (“Metropolitan Nashville cannot

shield from the tyranny of the majority”, McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 
357, 115 S.Ct. 1511, but it is not a shield from all legitimate 
regulation”); see also Does 1-10 v. Univ. of Washington, 798 F. 
App'x 1009, 1010 (9th Cir. 2020) (to prevail on their First 
Amendment claim, the Doe plaintiffs must show that particular 
individuals or groups of individuals were engaged in activity 
protected by the First Amendment and “‘a reasonable probability 
that the compelled disclosure of personal information will 
subject’” those individuals or groups of individuals “‘to threats, 
harassment, or reprisals’” that would have a chilling effect on 
that activity.)   
 
unrelated to suppression of free expression; and if incidental restriction on alleged First 
Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to furtherance of that interest. Id.  
 
 
 

--- Page 29 ---
-24- 
Indeed, this exact same standard regarding disclosure has 
already been accepted under Washington’s Public Records Act: 
The disclosure of Plaintiffs’ information here would 
have a similarly unconstitutional chilling effect. As 
erotic dance studio employees, Plaintiffs are 
uniquely vulnerable to harassment, shaming, 
stalking, or worse. Plaintiffs have express concern 
regarding the enhanced risk that disclosure of their 
real names and other licensing information might 
bring. They plausibly claim that they would not 
have engaged in their profession had they known 
that their erotic license information could be so 
easily disclosed to any member of the public. This 
is exactly the kind of chilling effect that the Ninth 
Circuit held to be unconstitutional in Dream 
Palace. Thus, the Plaintiffs’ information is 
protected under the First Amendment, and it is 
exempted from disclosure under the PRA.” 
 
Roe v. Anderson, No. 3:14-CV-05810 RBL, 2015 WL 4724739, 
at *3 (W.D. Wash. Aug. 10, 2015). 
 
 
Thus, the standard, already stated in previous briefing, is 
whether there is a “reasonable probability” that disclosure would 
subject an objector to “threats, harassment, or reprisals” that 
would have a “chilling effect.”  This is where the Court should 
focus its attention.

c. The Facts Have Changed Since March 2021 & 
An Undisputable Chilling Effect Exists Today  
  
Regardless of the Trial Court’s erroneous legal 
determinations during the March 10, 2021 preliminary injunction 
hearing, the facts today are fundamentally different.  
First, most importantly, the OPA Summary was not 
completed or published in March 2021.  Once published in July 
2021, the OPA Summary unequivocally established that the 
Represented Officers were off duty, lawfully exercising their 
First Amendment Rights, and committed no misconduct on 
January 6, 2021.    
Second, the Represented Officers each submitted 
sufficient declarations at the preliminary injunction stage related 
to their various concerns, which were not “extremely vague and 
self-serving affidavits,” but, considering the timeline, time 
constraints and need for anonymity fully sufficient.17  However, 
even considering only the limited amount of new evidence

-26- 
judicial notice would allow under ER 201, the Represented 
Officers’ concerns have been amplified by an order of 
magnitude.  This case has been the subject of at least five (5) 
Seattle Times articles.18  Indeed, the case was deemed so 
important that the Supreme Court took this case on direct review, 
bypassing the Court of Appeals, because “whether the identity of 
these officers should be revealed is an issue of considerable 
public interest.”  See Commissioners Johnston 8/4/21 Ruling at 
p. 4.  Would anyone ever make a political statement, only to have

their names involuntarily splashed across newspapers in their 
hometown where their political beliefs are “reviled?”  
Third, the Represented Officers have been targeted by 
various Amici, including the National Lawyers Guild, who have 
no qualms stating, without any basis, that these officers are 
affiliated with “white supremacists” and are a cause of racially 
motivated extrajudicial arrests, incarceration, and killings.  
Indeed, the NLG Brief did not even bother to discuss the 
vindicating OPA Summary, or frankly have the basic decency to 
make it clear that these Represented Officers did not participate 
in any insurrection, committed no crimes, but merely attended 
the lawful rally beforehand.  The filing of this reckless NLG 
Brief in Washington’s highest court, publicly available to anyone 
on Westlaw, alone constitutes harassment.  See Brief of Amicus 
Curiae The National Lawyers Guild cited at 2021 WL 4804274. 
Finally, any neutral observer, observing posture of the 
case today, can predict with “reasonable probability” that the 

--- Page 33 ---
-28- 
Represented Officers will be subject to further “threats, 
harassment, or reprisals” which would have a “chilling effect.”  
The Represented Officers reiterate the bottom line one 
final time: the OPA Summary has been released.  This fully 
details the OPA investigative process, the evidence gathered and 
reviewed, the ultimate finding of no misconduct, and the 
rationale behind that determination.  The police officers who did 
engage in misconduct have been named and fired.  The oversight 
process was transparent and has worked as designed.     
The neutral observer only needs to ask one question today: 
Why?  Why do the NLG Amici, and the Respondents, still 
demand the names of the Represented Officers when they 
already know everything about their activities on January 6, 
2021?  What exactly are they going to do with the Represented 
Officers’ names once they receive them?  Keep them secret?   
Hardly.19 
 
19 Similarly, the National Lawyers Guild Seattle Chapter has not updated their website to 
reflect the OPA Summary has already been released and much of the material in their 
publicized brief on the site is outdated (and as such is now very misleading standing alone). 

--- Page 34 ---
-29- 
The Represented Officers’ names will surely be further 
publicized by NLG Amici, the Respondents, other Amici (who 
are no less than “24 Media and Transparency Organizations)20,” 
not to mention the Seattle Times and other local and national 
news outlets.  The Represented Officers’ names will be 
involuntarily publicized throughout a community that reviles 
their political beliefs even though the Represented Officers did 
nothing more than exercise their Constitutional rights while off 
duty. 
How could any neutral observer state that this unwanted 
publicity does not constitute harassment?  Likewise, how could 
this unwanted publicity regarding unpopular views not have an 
instant chilling effect?  
V.  
CONCLUSION  
  
The NLG Brief does not establish a “compelling interest.”  
The NLG Brief employs the wrong analysis of First Amendment 
 
https://www.nlg-seattle.org/posts/seattle-chapter-members-represent-nlg-student-
member-in-john-and-jane-does-1-6-vs-seattle-pd-opa-sueoka-et-al

challenges to the PRA.  Finally, the NLG Briefs fails to 
acknowledge the “reasonable probability” of “harassment and 
reprisals” that “chills” First Amendment expression—of which 
the recklessly inflammatory NLG Brief is quite clearly a perfect 
case-in-point.  The Represented Officers’ Constitutional Rights 
supersede the PRA. 
 
Respectfully, as stated in the Supplemental Brief, this 
Court should reverse the trial court’s order denying the 
Represented Officers’ request for a preliminary injunction, and 
remand with instructions to the trial court to enjoin production of 
the Represented Officers names or identities.
