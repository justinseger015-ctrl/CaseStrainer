ISSUE PRESENTED 
1. 
WHETHER A PETITIONER WHO WAS 
REPRESENTED BY A PERSON ADMITTED

STATE MUST DEMONSTRATED ACTUAL 
PREJUDICE IN A COLLATERAL ATTACK 
BASED 
UPON 
THE

LICENSING 
STATUS 
IN 
WASHINGTON. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 8 ---
II. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Petitioners in this matter raise the issue of 
whether their right to counsel was violated when they were 
represented by Robert Van ldour, an attorney who was 
licensed in a neighboring state but not Washington. 
Because this issue is being raised for the first time in a 
post-conviction collateral attack, the Petitioners are required 
to demonstrate actual prejudice rather than a per se 
violation. Because they fail to do so, their Personal 
Restraint Petitions should be dismissed. 
Additionally, based on federal precedent, Mr. Van 
ldour qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes 
at the time he represented Petitioners. Washington Courts 
have held that the Washington State Constitution provides 
the same protections as the United States Constitution on 
issues related to the right to counsel. Therefore, this Court 
should find that he also qualified as counsel under 
Washington law. 
Finally, Washington Courts have held that violation of 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
2 

--- Page 9 ---
the Rules of Professional Conduct does not establish a per 
se violation of the right to counsel, and that the appropriate 
sanction is investigation and discipline by the Washington 
State Bar Counsel. This Court should stand by that well-
reasoned precedent here. 
Ill. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
Robert L. Ayerst (Petitioner Ayerst) was convicted 
after jury trial of Attempted Burglary in the Second Degree, 
Malicious Mischief in the Second Degree, and Bail Jumping 
(C Felony), from events occurring September 6, 2016. See 
35867-4-111, 2019 WL 1568060 (Div. Ill, Apr. 11 , 2019) 
(Unpublished).1 
The underlying facts of the case are 
largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. 
Justin C. Lewis (Petitioner Lewis) was convicted after 
jury trial of Assault in the First Degree, Robbery in the First 
Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), 
1The State does not cite the unpublished decision 
for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural 
and factual background of the case. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia from events 
occurring April 4, 201 7. See State v. Justin C. Lewis, 8 
Wn.App. 1028 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019) {Unpublished).2 The 
underlying facts of the case are likewise immaterial and 
warrant no discussion. 
Petitioner Ayerst was initially represented by John 
Fay, who was later replaced by attorney Robert Van ldour 
who represented him through trial. See Bond Order 
(10/04/16) and Motion and Order Allowing Withdrawal and 
Substitution, submitted with the State's Response to 
Personal Restraint Petition. 
Petitioner Lewis was 
represented by attorney Mr. Van ldour throughout the 
proceeding from its origin. 
Bond Order (04/05/17) (see 
attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition 
and attached documents, attached hereto). 
Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and 
had arranged to practice under APR 8(c), which authorizes

and factual background of the case.

attorneys who are licensed by other states to appear for the 
purposes of public defense while they apply for a formal 
license to practice in Washington. Declaration of Robert J. 
Van ldour. Mr. Van ldour also applied for formal admission 
to the Washington State Bar by motion under APR 3(c). 
See Personal Restraint Petition Appendix A. He was later 
notified that his application for admission by motion under 
APR 3(c) was accepted, and that his application for limited 
admission under APR 8(c) had been denied. Appendix A. 
At the time of his appointment, Mr. Van ldour had been an 
attorney, licensed in the State of Idaho for more than 30 
year and was, at that time, 3 a member in good standing with 
the Idaho State Bar Association. Declaration of Robert J. 
Van ldour. 
Petitioner Ayerst appealed his conviction, and it was 
affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion. 
3 The Idaho Bar Association Website indicates Mr. 
Van ldour's status as "inactive" as of December 15, 2021. 
According to the WSBA webside, Mr. Van ldour was 
suspended by order of the Washington Supreme Court 
for eighteen months effective September 14, 2021. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 12 ---
See 
State v. Ayerst,35867-4-11I, 2019 WL 1568060. 
Petitioner Ayerst then filed this personal restraint petition, 
alleging that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, 
relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not 
licensed to practice in Washington. He has neither identified 
any deviation from the standard of practice for criminal 
defense lawyers in Washington, nor any prejudice 
therefrom. 
Petitionยทer Lewis appealed his conviction after trial, 
and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an 
unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, supra. Petitioner 
Lewis then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging only 
that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying 
solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to 
practice in Washington. Petitioner Lewis neither argued nor 
demonstrated that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of 
misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor did he otherwise claim 
any prejudice therefrom. In an unpublished decision, the 
Division Three of the Court of Appeals dismissed the 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 13 ---
Defendant's PRP, finding that 1) Petitioner Lewis failed to 
allege he was prejudiced by his attorney's representation 
and 2) the facts set forth in his petition failed to establish 
that he should be excused from showing prejudice based 
on a theory of structural error. Matter of Lewis, 37284-7-111, 
2021 WL 1750935 (Div. 111, May 4, 2021) (unpublished). 4 
In a published decision, Division Three of the Court of 
Appeals dismissed Petitioner Ayerst's petition, finding that 
1) the facts set forth in his petition failed to establish that he 
should be excused from showing prejudice based on a 
theory of structural error and Petitioner Ayerst failed to 
allege that he was 
prejudiced 
by his attorney's 
representation. see Matter of Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d 356 
(2021 ). 
Petitioners Ayerst and Lewis both separately sought 
review by this Court of the Court of Appeals' decision which 
was granted, solely on the issue regarding the right to

counsel, and the matters consolidated for consideration. 
IV. 
ARGUMENT 
A collateral attack is not a substitute for a direct 
appeal. The Washington State Constitution draws a 
distinction between direct appeals fo criminal convictions 
and habeas corpus actions. Const. art. 1. ยงยง 13, 22. 
Specifically, collateral, attacks are generally held to a 
heightened standard to protect the principle of finality. In re 
Pers. Restraint of Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 115, 120 (2014). 
Additionally, in a collateral post-conviction proceeding, the 
Petitioner bears the burden rather than the State. In re 
Pers. Restraint of Sandoval, 189 Wn.2d 811 , 821 (2018). 
"[A] personal restraint petitioner must first establish by 
preponderance of the evidence that a constitutional error 
has resulted in actual and substantial prejudice." In re Pers. 
Restaint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 671 (2014) (internal 
citations omitted). 
A constitutional error alone does not generally meet 
the requisite prejudice. State v. Buckman, 190 Wn.2d 51, 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
8 

--- Page 15 ---
56 n.1 (2018). Thus, an error creating the possibility of 
prejudice is insufficient-the petition must show that "the 
outcome would more likely than not have been different had 
the alleged error not occurred." In re Pers. Restraint of 
ยท Meippen, 193 Wn.2d 310 (2019) (internal citations omitted). 
"Although some errors which result prejudice on direct 
review will also be per se prejudicial on collateral attack, the 
interests of finality of litigation demand that a higher 
standard be satisfied in a collateral proceeding." In the 
Matter of the Personal Restraint of St. Pierre, 118 Wn.2d 
321, 329 (1992). Since the decision in St. Pierre, this Court 
has applied this higher standard for collateral attacks to 
court closures, an otherwise structural error. See In re 
Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 115, 121-22 (2014).5 
If a petitioner fails to make the required "prima facie 
5At least one amicus brief cites to In re Crace for 
the proposition that the higher standard for collateral 
attacks does not apply ineffective assistance of counsel 
claims. 17 4 Wn.2d 835. However, the holding of In re 
Crace suggests only that a petitioner in a collateral attack 
need not show additional prejudice beyond the 
requirements of Strickland v. Washington. Id. at 848. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
9 

--- Page 16 ---
showing of actual and substantial" prejudice, the result is 
dismissal of the collateral attack. In re Meippen, 193 Wn.2d 
at 316. Furthermore, in a collateral attack, the burden is on 
the petitioner to identify and, when available, produce the 
necessary record to support the claim. A petitioner who 
raises a claim is required to have some factual basis to 
support it and point the court to where those facts are being 
drawn from. In re Pers. Restraint of Cook, 114 Wn.2d 802, 
813-14 (1990); see also RAP 16.7 (a)(2)-(3). Unsupported 
allegations lacking citations to authority or references to the 
record or to competent admissible evidence are not 
sufficient to sustain the petitioner's burden. In re Cook, 114 
Wn.2d at 813-14. Failure to meet this burde results in 
dismissal of the petition. Petition of Williams, 111 Wn.2d 
353, 364-65 (1998). 
Here, the Petitioners do not argue that they were 
prejudiced by Mr. Van ldour's representation. They do not 
identify any deficiencies in Mr. Van ldour's representation 
of them Rather, the Petitioners assert that representation by 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
10 

--- Page 17 ---
Mr. Van !dour constituted a per se violation of their 
constitutional right to counsel. Petition for Review from 
Division Three of the Court of Appeals #369650-111 at 7; 
Petition for Review from Division Three of the Court of 
Appeals #37284-7-111 at 2. In doing so, they rely heavily on 
the holding of City of Seattle vs. Ratliff. 100 Wn.2d 212 
(1983). However, Ratliff was decided on direct appeal. 
Assuming, arguendo, that the holding of Ratliff applies to 
attorneys licensed outside of Washington State1 that case 
was decided under a different standard. The Petitioners 
have raised this issue for the first time as part of a post-
conviction collateral attack; therefore, a demonstration of 
prejudice is.required. Withoutanyevidenceofprejudice, the 
Personal Restraint Petitions should be dismissed. 
A criminal defendant unquestionably has the right to 
effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, 
Section 22 of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., 
In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 6471 672 (2004). 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
11 

--- Page 18 ---
To sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the 
petitioner 
must 
demonstrate 
that 
(1) 
counsel's 
representation was deficient and (2) that counsel's deficient 
representation caused prejudice. Id. ( quoting State v. 
McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35 (1995)). Here, 
Petitioners claim that their respective Sixth Amendment and 
Article I, Section 22 rights were violated. This Court has 
routinely held that Article I, Section 22 is no more protective 
than the Sixth Amendment and neither Petitioner has 
argued or offered analysis suggesting otherwise. State v. 
Moore, 79 Wn.2d 51 (1971 ); State v. Earls, 116 Wn.2d 364, 
375 (1991); State v. Hager, 171 Wn.2d 151, (2011); State 
v. Mayer, 184 Wn.2d 548, 569 ("The right to counsel under 
our state constitution and the federal constitution is the 
same.") 
On direct appeal, courts have found complete 
deprivation of counsel to have occurred where the 
purported "counsel" has never been duly licensed to 
practice law in any jurisdiction. United States v. Novak, 903 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
12 

--- Page 19 ---
F.2d 883, 890 (2d. Cir. 1990). This finding is limited to 
instances where counsel has failed to ever meet the 
substantive requirements to practice law. See Solina v. 
United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983) (counsel 
repeatedly failed the bar exam and was not licensed in any 
jurisdiction); See also People v. Felder. 47 N.Y.2d 287, 391 
N.E.2d 1274 (1979) (counsel had never attended law 
school or otherwise satisfied the prerequisites for bar 
admission, and had never been licensed in any jurisdiction); 
See also Novak, 903 F.2d 883 (2d. Cir. 1990) (counsel had 
never taken the bar exam and received admission to the bar 
through fraudulent means). 
Conversely, courts have held that the Sixth 
Amendment right to "counsel" is satisfied when a defendant 
is represented by someone who is authorized to practice 
law rather than a lay person. See State v. S.M., 100 Wn. 
App. 401 , 410 (2000) (quoting United States v. Gismore, 
546 F.2d 844, 847 (10th Cir. 1976)). In other words, a 
defendant who is represented by a person who has been 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
13 

--- Page 20 ---
licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction has not suffered 
from a per se Sixth Amendment violation. See, e.g.,United 
States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2000) 
('We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se 
ineffectiveness rule beyond those cases in which a 
defendant is represented by a person never properly 
admitted to any bar.'); United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 
F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir. 1998) (''the key to adequate 
representation is not technical license to practice in the 
jurisdiction involved, but a credential from some forum 
demonstrating the specialized knowledge of a lawyer.'). 
Specifically, various federal and state courts have 
addressed cases where the defendant was represented by 
an out-of-state attorney who had not been admitted pro hoc 
vice. See, e.g., Cole v. United States, 162 F.3d 957, 959 
(7th Cir. 1998); Kieserv. New York, 56 F.3d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 
1995) (lawyer suspended in New Jersey and not admitted 
pro hac vice in New York when case was tried); United 
States v. Costanzo, 740 F.2d 251, 258-59 (3d Cir. 1984); 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
14 

--- Page 21 ---
Derringer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1141 (8th Cir. 
1971 ). 
For instance, in Ferrara v. Keane, trial counsel was 
licensed to practice in New Jersey, but not in New York 
where the proceedings took place. 806 F.Supp. 472, 473 
(S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). In 
deciding Petitioner's ineffective assistance counsel claim, 
the court concluded that because counsel was admitted in 
another jurisdiction for more than 30 years, it could not be 
said that he failed to meet the "substantive requirements" 
for the practice of law. Id. at 474. Where counsel would 
have been eligible for limited admission to practice in the 
forum court, but failed to make a formal application, the 
representation provided is not automatically ineffective. 
United States v. Bradford, 238 F.2d 395 (2d. Cir. 1956) 
( counsel who failed to comply with court rule for limited 
admission was not automatically ineffective); see also 
Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. at 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) 
(even assuming counsel's petition to proceed pro hac vice 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
15 

--- Page 22 ---
was flawed, defendant was required to show prejudice). 
Even the disbarment of 
counsel during trial 
proceedings is insufficient to find complete deprivation of 
cousel. United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682,698 (9th Cir. 
1986). In Mouzin, defense counsel was notified during trial 
that he had been disbarred by the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. Id. at 694-95. Pursuant to local rule, disbarment in 
any jurisdiction resulted in disbarment from the trial court. 
Id. at 695. Counsel, with consent of the trial judge, 
continued to represent the defendant through trial. Id. On 
review, the Ninth Circuit concluded that even an automatic 
disbarment from the trial court was insufficient to render 
counsel's representation ineffective. Id. at 698. 
Similarly, representation by a lawyer whose license 
has been suspended does not constitute a complete 
deprivation of counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 
479 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir.) (suspension of a state license 
not per se ineffective assistance of counsel); Hardaman v. 
United States, 319 F.3d 943, 951 (7th Cir. 2003)

(suspension of an attorney does not amount to per se 
ineffective assistance); State v. Edison, 61 Wn. App. 
( 1991) ( defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice when 
represented by a lawyer who has been licensed but whose 
license was suspended). 
Here, Mr. Van ldour was licensed to practice law in 
another jurisdiction, and had been for 30 years. Even if the 
requirements of APR 8 were not satisfied, it cannot be said 
Mr. Van ldour failed to ever meet the "substantive 
requirements" to practice law.6 Furthermore, during the 
course of his representation of Petitioner, Mr. Van ldour 
ยท 
6 Interestingly and by contrast, an entire class of bar 
applicants was recently granted admission due to 
COVID-19, having never demonstrated fitness to practice 
law through the usual screening process of the bar 
examination. Unlike these applicants, Mr. Van ldour had 
successfully passed a bar exam and his three decades 
practice without disciplinary action attest to his fitness, 
even where he failed to fill out all necessary paperwork 
and follow through with his reciprocal application process 
with the WSBA, for which he was undoubtably otherwise 
eligible."Over 1000 New Lawyers Get Licenses Without

remained a licensed attorney in good standing in Idaho. If 
formal disbarment during trial does not constitute a 
deprivation of counsel, certainly representation by a 
licensed attorney in good standing cannot meet the 
requisite standard. 
Furthermore, Mr. Van ldourwas eligible for reciprocal 
admission. Moreover, he could have practiced pro hac vice 
in any court in Washington, with permission of that court, 
and he was certainly eligible to provide public defense 
under APR 8. His only deficiency was his failure to be 
mindful of and properly follow the strictures of that rule. 
Where suspension or even outright disbarment does not 
violate the 6th Amendment right to counsel, this deficiency, 
while not an insignificant barrier to the lawful and regulated 
practice of law, cannot be said to have amounted to an 
absolute deprivation of counsel. 
Finally, Petitioners and amici emphasize the fact that 
Mr. Van ldour's failure to obtain a Washington license 
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), including 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

the Standards for Indigent Defense. However, this Court 
has determined that, while they may be used to evaluate a 
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the "professional 
standards do not establish minimum Sixth Amendment 
requirements." State v. A.N.J, 168 Wn.2d 91, 965-66 
(2010). Furthermore, Washington Courts have declined to 
find that defense counsel provided ineffective based solely 
on counsel's violation of the Standards for Indigent Defense 
(SID). State v. Flores, 197 Wn.App. 1, 15 (Div. Ill, 2016), 
review denied in 188 Wn.2d 1003. In addressing the lack of 
remedy for violations of the SID, the Court found that "[t]he 
omission suggests that the remedy for violations of the 
standards rests with the disciplinary process." Id. at 15. The 
Court then stated that "[w]hether there was a violation of the 
Rules of Professional Conduct is a question that only an 
appropriate investigation can answer'' and declined to issue 
an opinion on the matter. Id. at 15-16. 
Similarly to the Appellant in Flores, the Petitioners 
emphasize Mr. Van ldour's violation of the RPC and SID in 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
19

arguing that his representation was deficient under the Sixth 
Amendment. Amicus The Defender Initiative also suggests 
that "[rJeversing the convictions in this case will make it 
clear that the court intends to enforce the Standards it 
adopted." However, this Court has already determined that 
an appropriate remedy exists-an investigation by the bar 
counsel and, if a violation is found to have been committed, 
disciplinary action by the same. This Court should stand by 
its well-reasoned precedent. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Without any showing of prejudice resulting from Mr. 
Van ldour's representation, the Petitioners fail to meet the 
heightened requirements for a post conviction collateral 
attack. Furthermore, Mr. Van ldour's representation 
qualified as "counsel" for the purposes of the Sixth 
Amendment and, by extension, the Washington State 
Constitution. Therefore, the Respondent respectfully 
request that this Court affirm the Court of Appeals' decision
