I.  INTRODUCTION 
The pharmaceutical industry is unlike any other 
commercial enterprise.  It is replete with contradictions; for 
example, while the pharmaceutical industry has prolonged life 
and alleviated suffering for more than a century, it is identified 
in opinion surveys as one of the least trusted entities, right 
alongside nuclear power plants. 1/ And while the pharmaceutical 
industry is one of the riskiest business enterprises in which to 
invest, the general public views “Big Pharma” 2/ as excessively 
profitable. 3/ No other industry in the world demands more 
financial risk than the pharmaceutical industry.  Every new drug 
discovery requires, on average, a financial investment of about 
$1.5 billion and it takes about 14 years before any new drug, 
assuming a new drug is actually developed, can be approved for 
                                          
1/ See Taylor, “The Pharmaceutical Industry and the Future of Drug 
 
2/ “Big Pharma” was coined as a pejorative term to describe the large drug 
manufacturers of the pharmaceutical industry sector.  See Goldacre, Bad 
Pharma, 2013, Fourth Estate, London.

marketing. 4/ One can certainly appreciate the obstacles 
confronting the highly speculative pursuit of new drug 
therapies.  
The Petitioners-Plaintiffs (hereinafter “Plaintiffs” or “the 
Dearingers,” see RAP 10.4(e) 5/) are not unmindful of the 
challenges facing the Respondent-Defendant (hereinafter 
“Defendant” or “Eli Lilly & Co.”), indeed the entire 
pharmaceutical industry, in responding to the perpetual demand 
for better medicines.  Nevertheless, as with any business 
concern operating in the United States, it must operate ethically 
and responsibly;  Defendant clearly has not done so, as this case 
will show. 
Plaintiffs herein will demonstrate for the Court that 
Defendant had foreknowledge that its product has a dangerous

side-effect but chose to conceal that foreknowledge from, not 
only the public at large, but from the prescribing physicians as 
well; Defendant did so because it knew that its tortuous conduct 
would be sheltered from any legal consequences by the learned 
intermediary doctrine (hereinafter “LID”). 6/ Defendant has 
abused the special status bestowed upon it by the courts of this 
nation with the advent of the LID.   
Perhaps many of the criticisms directed toward the 
pharmaceutical industry are warranted.  Cases such as this 
should merit an exception to the LID. 
 
II. QUESTION CERTIFIED TO THE SUPREME COURT 
To assist in determining whether the Defendant is 
entitled, under Washington law, to application of the LID as a 
defense, United States District Judge John C. Coughenour has 
                                          
6/ In this brief the terms LID and LIR (learned intermediary rule) are used 
interchangeably.

certified, pursuant to RCW 2.60.020 (1965), the following 
question to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington:  
Is a manufacturer, that promotes a prescription 
drug through “direct-to-consumer” marketing, still 
exempt from warning the consumer of that drug’s 
dangerous side effects under the “Learned 
Intermediary Doctrine” adopted by the State of 
Washington in Terhune v. A.H. Robins Co., 577 
P.2d 925 (Wash. 1978)? 7/ 
 
Eli Lilly and Company has invoked the LID as a defense to 
shield itself for its refusal to warn consumers and physicians 
about the dangerous side effects of its product Cialis.  
 
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
This Court reviews certified questions of law de novo. 
Frias v. Asset Foreclosure Servs., Inc., 181 Wn.2d 412, 420, 
334 P.3d 529, 533 (2014), citing Carlsen v. Global Client 
                                          
7/ Judge Coughenour added the following: “The Court does not intend 
Plaintiffs’ framing of the question to restrict the Washington Supreme 
Court’s consideration of any other issues that it determines are relevant. 
Moreover, the Washington Supreme Court may, in its discretion, 
reformulate the question in whatever manner it finds most appropriate. See 
Affiliated FM Ins. Co. v. LTK Consulting Servs. Inc., 556 F.3d 920, 922 
(9th Cir. 2009).” Order of July 6, 2021 (Dkt. No. 28).

Solutions, LLC, 171 Wn.2d 486, 493, 256 P.3d 321 (2011).  
The Court considers the questions presented “in light of the 
record certified by the federal court.” Id.  Because the federal 
court has certified the question here in connection with a 
motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief 
may be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), all facts 
alleged in the complaint must be accepted as true.  Frias, supra, 
citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 
S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). 
 
IV. STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
This case comes before the Court on a certified question 
from the United States District Court for the Western District of 
Washington.  The underlying civil action was initiated by 
Plaintiffs 8/ under that court’s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 
1332(a)(1) (Defendant is an Indiana Corporation), and under 
Washington’s Products Liability Act, RCW 7.72 et seq.

(hereinafter “WPLA”).  Mr. Dearinger was injured by a 
prescription drug manufactured and marketed by the Defendant.  
 
A.  Factual Background 
(1) Discovery of the Phosphodiesterase-5 Enzyme 
      Inhibitor 
 
The first phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor 
(hereinafter “PDE5 inhibitor”) was discovered quite by accident 
in 1989 by the Pfizer Corporation 9/ while seeking a drug 
therapy to treat angina pectoris. 10/  While the PDE5 inhibitor 
Pfizer tested failed as an effective treatment for angina pectoris, 
“a very observant nurse” discovered that some of the male 
subjects were embarrassed by an unexpected benefit 11/ of the 
PDE5 inhibitor being tested. 12/ 
                                          
9/ The Pfizer Corporation is not involved with this litigation. 
 
10/Goldstein, Burnett, Rosen; The Serendipitous Story of Sildenafil: An 
Unexpected Oral Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction, 2019, Sexual 
Medicine Reviews. 7 (1): 115–128. 
 
11/ Inasmuch that maintaining decorum is essential to the orderly 
administration of justice, Plaintiffs will endeavor to respect the dignity of 
this honorable Court and refrain from stating the obvious. 

--- Page 16 ---
7 
 
The PDE5 inhibitor was patented by Pfizer under the 
generic name Sildenafil in 1996 and was approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (hereinafter “FDA”) for sale to the 
public as a treatment for erectile dysfunction (hereinafter “ED”) 
on March 27, 1998 under the registered trademark Viagra®. 
 
(2) The Marketing of Cialis 
Defendant patented its own version of the PDE5 inhibitor 
called Tadalafil, which was approved by the FDA on November 
21, 2003 (Drug Application #021368) for manufacture and sale 
under the registered trademark Cialis® 13/ (the prescription drug 
at issue in this case) also for the treatment of ED. 14/   
                                                                                                         
 
12/ Goldstein, supra. 
  
13/ The most notable distinction between Viagra and Cialis is the duration 
of the therapeutic effectiveness, which is 36 hours for Cialis and only 5 
hours for Viagra.   
 
14/ The FDA later approved Cialis® for the treatments of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) on May 22, 2009 and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) on October 6, 2011. 
 

--- Page 17 ---
8 
 
Based upon the available cultural research, Defendant 
knew that the PDE5 inhibitor could possibly become the most 
sought-after life-style drug ever discovered, 15/ and in view of 
the inordinately high importance our generation places upon 
connubial relations, 16/ Defendant wasted no time in announcing 
to its shareholders that it was beginning an aggressive new 
“direct-to-consumer” (hereinafter “DTC”) advertising 
campaign, independent of prescribing physicians.   
In answering the question:  
How can [Eli] Lilly [and Co.] do justice to so 
many new products all at once? And, with so many 
launches, can you afford to grow earnings in 2004? 
 
Defendant answered thus: 
                                          
15/ A 1994 study estimated that 10-20 million people in America suffer 
from impotence.  Feidman, HA, Goldstein, I. & Hatzfchrfstou, D.G., 
Impotence and its medical and psychosocial correlates: results of the 
Massachusetts male aging study, 1994, Journal of Urology, 151, 54-61. 
 
16/ “Sex is a man's second strongest instinct, after that of survival. This 
means that if a man's life is not immediately imperiled, the next thing he 
will automatically think of is sex. This is a fundamental reality of life and 
explains why sexual impotence or erectile dysfunction is associated with 
so much of distress, guilt, shame and embarrassment.” Trivedi, J.K., 
Contemporary Issues in Management of Impotence, 1998, Indian J. 
Psychiat, 40 (3), 199-200,

This year, we are investing aggressively to market 
Cialis in the U.S. and will have additional new 
expenditures when we launch Cymbalta and 
duloxetine SUI, but, for the most part, the 
infrastructure investments needed to support these

Cialis was launched in 2003 in several markets 
outside the U.S. by Lilly and ICOS. Cialis was 
launched in the U.S. in early December 2003. 
Cialis had total sales of $203.3 million in 2003. Of 
this total, $73.5 million represent sales in our 
exclusive territories and are reported in our net 
sales. The remaining Cialis sales relate to the joint-
venture territories of Lilly ICOS LLC (North 
America and Europe) and are reported in the Lilly 
ICOS joint-venture income statement along with 
related expenses. We report our 50 percent share 
of the operating results of the joint venture in our 
net other income. In early 2004, Lilly ICOS began 
a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign in the 
U.S. We will continue to increase our direct-to-
consumer advertising activities in print and on 
television.

second television commercials began appearing in prime-time 
with bikini clad young women  19/ reminding men of how good 
life used to be.  The commercials would contain a one-sentence 
warning about priapism (which most men would consider an 
inducement rather than a warning) but not a single word about 
the dangerous side-effect of intracerebral hemorrhage

the ancient Greek writer/historian Herodotus in about 430 B.C.  Bathing 
in, or swallowing, its waters would cease, even reverse, aging.  Its legend 
endured onto 1513 A.D. and the Spanish conquistador Ponce de León, 
whose voyage to discover the epic fountain in Florida was referenced in 
Nathanial Hawthorne’s 1837 short story collection Twice-Told Tales: “Dr. 
Heidegger's Experiment.”  The Fountain has become a metaphor for 
humankind’s incessant desire to regain the lost springtime of life and 
represents what everyone desires: hope for a longer and better life.  The 
legend of such a fountain yet lives on into the twenty-first century, kept 
alive by direct-to-consumer marketing of recreational pharmaceuticals like 
PDE5.

(3) Intracerebral Hemorrhage: the Intentionally Concealed 
Side Effect of Cialis 
 
Reports began to surface from all over the world that the 
PDE5 inhibitor is not nearly as safe as the pharmaceutical 
industry has portrayed in its DTC advertising; case studies 
reveal that PDE5 inhibitors cause ICH.  
In as early as 2001 a letter was published in the Journal 
of Neurology by four Italian neurologists documenting a 67 
year-old dentist who suffered an ICH after ingesting a 25 mg 
Viagra® tablet.  Monastero, Pipia, Camarda; Intracerebral 
Haemorrhage Associated With Sildenafil Citrate, J Neurol, 
2001, 248:141-142.  (Attached hereto as Appendix 1-2). 20/ 
                                          
20/ Plaintiffs acknowledge the hard work done by employees of the 
Washington State Library System, particularly reference librarians Kelsey 
Smith (Washington State Library, Olympia, Washington) and Mary 
Whisner (Gallagher Law Library, University of Washington School of 
Law, Seattle, Washington), who provided copies of the journal articles 
reproduced in the Appendix section of this brief.  The 11 studies appearing 
in the Appendix are not exhaustive.  There are several more studies 
available that document the risk for intracranial hemorrhage when 
ingesting PDE5 inhibitors, some cited in the bibliography section of each 
of these studies.  Plaintiffs hope the 11 examples provided in the 
Appendix will suffice to advise the Court of the abundance of evidence 
available to alert the Defendant as early as 2001, that ICH is a serious risk

In 
2005 
researchers 
from 
the 
Neurology 
and 
Neurosurgery Departments of the  Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minnesota reported that a 59 year-old man suffered an ICH 
after taking a 10 mg Cialis® tablet.  Steeves, Jones, Ecker; 
Coital Hemorrhage of an Arteriovenous Malformation after 
Premedication with Tadalafil (Cialis), J Stroke and Cerebrov

 In 2006 a response to the article: McGee HT, Egan RA, 
Clark WM. Visual field defect and intracerebral hemorrhage 
associated with use of vardenafil (Levitra). Neurology 2005; 
64:1095–1096, a Dr. Hellstrom took issue with the causality of 
the subject’s ICH: 
The issue of causality and association of vardenafil 
with ICH may be difficult to ascertain in this 
patient in the McGee article because of the 
following confounders: although rare, ICH has 
been reported for all 3 PDE-5 inhibitors; the 
specific doses and duration of therapy with the 
previously used PDE -5 inhibitor (sildenafil) were 
not given; although no history of drug use was 
mentioned, a toxicology screen was not conducted; 
                                                                                                         
when ingesting PDE5 inhibitors that should have been included in the 
Defendant’s DTC advertisements and warning literature.        

--- Page 22 ---
13 
 
and a multiplicity of risk factors are involved in 
the etiology of ICH3.  
 
To that statement the authors responded: 
We appreciate Dr. Hellstrom’s response to our 
article1 and agree with all of his points. When 
assessing whether or not a side effect is related to a 
medication, timing of onset of symptoms in 
relation to ingestion of drug is important in 
addition to whether symptoms recur when the 
patient takes the drug again. Today, serious side 
effects of medications are difficult to prove since 
patients are reluctant to rechallenge themselves 
with a drug they believe was implicated in causing 
their symptoms. Therefore, we are left with the 
timing of onset of symptoms to ingestion.   
 
Although we, the authors, are at a loss to 
hypothesize a mechanism of causation of ICH in 
our patient, our intention was to alert the medical 
community to this possible association through 
publication.

To summarize: Defendant knew as early as the year 
2001, two years before the FDA approved Cialis, that ingestion 
of PDE5 inhibitors could result in ICH. 
 
(4)  Plaintiffs’ Injury 
 
Because Defendant refused to warn the public (or even 
warn prescribing physicians) that Cialis can cause an ICH, Mr. 
Dearinger unknowingly ingested Cialis and two hours later 
suffered an ICH which left him hemiplegic with left side 
paralysis; Mr. Dearinger has lost the use of his left arm and leg. 
Plaintiffs filed a civil complaint against Eli Lilly & Co. 
alleging negligent design, negligent failure to warn, breach of 
warranty, and a common law claim for Mrs. Dearinger’s loss of 
consortium.  Eli Lilly & Co. countered with a motion to

dismiss, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 21/ citing the LID as 
its defense. 
 
V.  ARGUMENT 
A.  Origin of the Learned Intermediary Doctrine 
The LID finds its origin in the common law.  Fifty-five 
(55) years ago the LID was born to a panel of the Eighth Circuit 
in the case of Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Cornish, 370 F.2d 82, 85 
(8th Cir.1966) 22/ (“the purchaser's doctor is a learned 
intermediary between the purchaser and the manufacturer” 
                                          
21/ Insofar as the certified question here is in connection with a motion for 
dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted 
pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), all facts alleged in the complaint must 
be accepted as true. Frias v. Asset Foreclosure Servs., Inc., supra. 
 
22/ The 1966 Eighth Circuit panel was comprised of Circuit Judge Charles 
Joseph Vogel, born in 1898, Circuit Judge Pat Mehaffy, born in 1904, and 
District Judge Edward Joseph McManus of the Northern District of Iowa 
sitting by designation, born in 1920. All three judges lived during a time 
when the decision to take a prescription drug was “exclusively a matter for 
medical judgment.”  Schwartz, Consumer-Directed Prescription Drug 
Advertising and the Learned Intermediary Rule, 40 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 
135, 136 (1985).

(emphasis added)), 23/ during a time when mass media was in its 
infancy; televisions were in fewer homes and the television 
commercial was a relatively new concept. 24/ Advertising of 
prescription drugs on television was inconceivable 1966.  In 
those days drug companies marketed their prescription drugs 
only to licensed physicians because only licensed physicians 
were aware of the existence of most prescriptions medications, 
thus advertising dollars were focused on the audience that made 
                                          
23/ The Eighth Circuit flirted with the idea of exempting drug manufactures 
from strict liability as early as 1925, yet found the defendant drug 
company in that case nevertheless liable in Hruska v. Parke, Davis & Co., 
6 F.2d 536 (8th Cir.1925). But the first actual case in the nation where a 
drug manufacturer was found to have fulfilled its duty to warn by warning 
only the physician was in 1948 with Marcus v. Specific Pharms., 191 
Misc. 285, 77 N.Y.S.2d 508 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1948), as noted by Odgers v. 
Ortho Pharm. Corp., 609 F.Supp. 867, 873 n. 12 (E.D.Mich.1985) and 
Larkin v. Pfizer, Inc., 153 S.W.3d 758, 762 (Ky.2004). 
 
24/ The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted Rules and 
Standards for commercial broadcast television effective as of July 1, 1941 
which permitted the world’s first “television commercial” that was aired 
on the same day. A ten second spot was purchased for $9 by the Bulova 
Watch Company and played in the New York City market immediately 
before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Phillies on 
the WNBC Network (owned by RCA) at 2:29 p.m. On that simplistic first 
TV commercial an audio message “America runs on Bulova time” was 
heard with a video of a still image of a clock face reading “8:00” with the 
inscription “Bulova Watch Time” superimposed over a still image of the 
continental United States.

the ultimate decision to prescribe 25/ a medication; the licensed 
physicians. 
Everything changed twenty years later when Big Pharma 
learned that profits could increase through DTC advertising 
which, in essence, bypasses the prescribing physician by 
diverting their advertising dollars away from the family doctor 
and targeting the patient directly: 
Direct-to-consumer 
(DTC) 
advertising 
is 
a 
relatively new area of prescription drug promotion. 
No federal law has ever banned DTC advertising. 
Until the mid-1980s, drug companies gave 
information about prescription drugs only to 
doctors and pharmacists. When these professionals 
thought it appropriate, they gave that information 
to their patients. However, during the 1980s, some 
drug companies started to give the general public 
more direct access to this information through 
DTC ads.

25/ The category of drugs requiring a “prescription” from a licensed 
physician was established under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act of 1938 with the creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
to regulate prescription drugs.  21 U.S.C. ch. 9 § 301 et seq. (1938).

Prescription drugs have entered a new era making the 
LID obsolete.  While the LID may have been valid at one time, 
it is no longer because drug companies now utilize DTC 
advertising where their drugs are now being advertised in 30 
second television commercials directed straight to the patient, 
and thereby bypassing prescribing physicians.   
 
(1) Changes To The Doctor-Patient Relationship 
As Defendant is undoubtedly aware, Health Management 
Organizations (HMOs) and managed care have greatly reduced 
the amount of time the family physician spends with each 
patient. 
[B]ecause managed care has reduced the time 
allotted per patient, physicians have considerably 
less time to inform patients of the risks and 
benefits of a drug. Stolberg, Faulty Warning 
Labels Add to Risk in Prescription Drugs, N.Y. 
Times, June 4, 1999, at A27. "In a 1997 survey of 
1,000 patients, the F.D.A. found that only one-
third had received information from their doctors 
about the dangerous side effects of drugs they were 
taking." Ibid. 
 

--- Page 32 ---
23 
 
Perez v. Wyeth Lab. Inc., 161 N.J. 1, 24, 734 A.2d 1245, 1255 
(1999).  
When the Supreme Court of New Jersey accepted the 
DTC advertising exception to the LID, it listed four premises 
upon which the LID was based: 
(1) reluctance to undermine the doctor patient-
relationship; (2) absence in the era of "doctor 
knows best" of need for the patient's informed 
consent; (3) inability of drug manufacturer to 
communicate with patients; and (4) complexity of 
the subject; are all (with the possible exception of 
the 
last) 
absent 
in 
the 
direct-to-consumer 
advertising of prescription drugs. 
 
Perez, supra.  In summary, the reasons why courts have 
adopted the LID in the first place have all but disappeared with 
the advent of DTC advertising. "Consumer-directed advertising 
of pharmaceuticals thus belies each of the premises on which 
the learned intermediary doctrine rests." State ex rel. Johnson & 
Johnson v. Karl, 220 W.Va. 463, 647 S.E.2d 899, 910 (2007).  
// 
//

(2) Increase of DTC Advertising 
In following the reasoning of New Jersey in Perez v. 
Wyeth Lab. Inc., supra, the Supreme Court of West Virginia 
rejected the LID outright in State ex rel. Johnson & Johnson v. 
Karl, supra.  The West Virginia Supreme Court noted the 
unmistakable spike in advertizing dollars spent by drug 
manufacturers when the FDA offered them guidance on how to 
market directly to consumers: 
In 1997, the FDA issued draft guidelines intended 
to supplement the regulations regarding broadcast 
advertisements. These guidelines led to a rapid 
proliferation of a newer, more informative 
broadcast 
advertisement, 
allowing 
the 
manufacturers to include both the product name 
and indication. The guidelines recommended that 
drug manufacturers provide a means for consumers 
to obtain more information (e.g. an Internet Web 
page address).

Internet: A Proposal for Regulation, 2 W. Va. J.L. & Tech. 1.1,

in State ex rel. Johnson & Johnson v. Karl, supra, 647 S.E.2d at

The massive increase in direct-to-consumer 
advertising in recent years is striking. One 
commentator has provided the following table 
tracking spending on direct-to-consumer, or DTC, 
spending from the year 1989 to the year 2001:

(3) Cialis is a Recreational Life-Style Drug 
Until recently ED had always been considered a normal, 
even welcome, sign of healthy aging. 27/ Treating ED as a 
disease would have been considered antithetical to the social 
norm of retired men devoting themselves to other interests, 
such as gardening or stamp collecting, in the natural 
progression onto the next sequential stage of life. 28/  
ED wasn’t coded as a disease until as recently as 2016 
under the ICD-10 29/ convention as “N52.9 - Male erectile 
dysfunction, unspecified”.  Prior to 2016, before the

29/ International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a diagnostic tool 
maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) used for statistical, 
epidemiological and health management purposes.  Its most recent 
manifestation, the ICD-10, in use since 1994, will be replaced by the ICD-

pharmaceutical industry convinced everyone that ED is a 
disease, there was the non-billable code of 607.84 under the 
general category as “Impotence of Organic Origin.” 
Cialis does not save anyone’s life nor does it relieve pain.  
It does not cure cancer and does not restore kidney function. 
Cialis is not the kind of drug anticipated in Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 402A (1965): 
There are some products which, in the present state 
of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being 
made safe for their intended and ordinary use. 
These are especially common in the field of drugs. 
 
Id. Comment K. 
The “Restatement (Second)” offers the example of 
Pasteur’s rabies vaccine “which not uncommonly leads to very 
serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.” 
Because the side-effects of the vaccine are an acceptable 
alternative to a painful death, on balance the vaccine is 
preferable despite the side-effects.  
Since the disease itself invariably leads to a 
dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of 

--- Page 37 ---
28 
 
the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the 
unavoidable high degree of risk which they 
involve. 
 
Ibid.  
Under Washington law, in order to fit the legal definition 
of “unavoidably unsafe,” and thus be eligible for the LID as a 
defense, a drug must meet all four of the criteria listed under 
Comment k of Section 402A of Restatement (Second) of Torts, 
adopted by this Court in Terhune v. A. H. Robins Co., 90 
Wash.2d 9, 577 P.2d 975 (1978): 
(1)  A showing that the product is incapable of being 
made safe for its intended and ordinary use;  (2)  That the 
benefits of the product justify its marketing and use despite the 
unavoidable risks;  (3)  That the product is properly prepared 
and marketed, and(4) That the product is accompanied by 
proper directions and warnings. 
Cialis fails on at least two criteria of Comment k:  Cialis 
is a recreational “life-style” drug, the kind mentioned by the 
Supreme Court of New Jersey: 

--- Page 38 ---
29 
 
[W]hen one considers that many of these "life-
style" drugs or elective treatments cause significant 
side effects without any curative effect, increased 
consumer protection becomes imperative, because 
these drugs are, by definition, not medically 
necessary. 
 
Perez v. Weyth Labs Inc., supra, 734 A.2d. at 1257 (quotation 
marks in original).  The benefits of Cialis, as a 100% 
recreational “life-style” drug, 30/ do not justify its risk of ICH.  
Moreover, as observed by four neurology professors reporting 
in the journal Missouri Medicine: 
FDA 
warns against possible 
cardiovascular 
adverse reactions, hearing loss, hypotension, and

Cialis (see note 14 at page 7): a variety of alpha blockers can treat BPH, 
and endothelin receptor antagonists can treat PAH.

Thus Cialis does not fit the category of drugs embodied 
within the scope of Comment k to qualify as “unavoidably 
unsafe.”  In any event, assuming that DTC advertising was not 
involved, Defendant is nevertheless ineligible for application of 
the LID as a defense.  Cialis does not fit the exception provided 
by Comment k, of Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of 
Torts.  
 
B.  Why the Learned Intermediary Doctrine Must Be 
            Re-examined  
 
(1) The LID Encourages Irresponsible Behavior 
Many courts and commentators have viewed commerce 
as a flowing “stream,” 31/ a metaphor to represent the process 
                                          
31/ The concept perhaps first began with Associate Justice Oliver Wendell 
Holmes, Jr. writing for a unanimous court, as he metaphorically viewed 
commerce in the abstract as a “current” to describe the movement of a 
product through interstate commerce,  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 
U.S. 375, 399, 25 S.Ct. 276, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905)(a purchase of cattle at 
the local stockyard affects the interstate continuum of trade, thereby 
invoking the Sherman Act to break-up the horizontal monopoly of the 
“Beef Trust” in accordance with the goals of the T. Roosevelt 
Administration; “the current thus existing is a current of commerce among 
the States”) as did Chief Justice (and former president) William Howard 
Taft nearly two decades later in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495, 516, 42

31 
 
whereby a product is manufactured, then passed onto a broker, 
then the wholesaler, then retailer, and eventually to the ultimate 
consumer of the product.  “Stream of commerce” is an apt 
description befitting a time predating the automobile.  
Plaintiffs, however, suggest that commerce is more aptly 
described as a multilane superhighway, something unknown in 
1905 because there were no automobiles then. 
On the “highway” of commerce there are varied lanes 
separated by the repercussions of the buying decisions 
involved.  There are lanes reserved for impulse buying, such as 
a new flavor of chewing gum, where the time required for the 
decision to purchase can be measured in milliseconds; retailers 
call such purchases “impulse buying” (those items that store 
owners move close to the cash register) where the purchase 
ramifications are de minimus.         
                                                                                                         
S.Ct. 397, 66 L.Ed. 735 (1922)(“The stockyards and the sales are 
necessary factors in the middle of this current of commerce”).   
  

--- Page 41 ---
32 
 
Conversely, there is a lane for products that consumers 
may require years to decide whether to purchase.  These 
products include homes, vehicles, cosmetic surgery, etc.  The 
ramifications are long term and sometimes permanent. 
The prescription drug manufactured by the Defendant, 
Cialis, should travel the lane closer to the latter example where 
purchases require much deliberation.  Unfortunately there 
would be fewer sales of Cialis if consumers deliberated on 
whether to purchase a “life-style” drug that carried a possible 
side-effect of ICH.  Thus Defendant “changed lanes” 32/ to be 
closer to the lane reserved for impulsive sales (which explains 
the bikinis, see note 19 at page 10).   
Prescription drugs have twenty (20) years of patent 
protection, which provide only a small window of opportunity 
where drug manufactures can earn maximum profits without 
competition in the marketplace from generic drug makers. 
                                          
32/ Our young people like to remind others, those with whom they disagree 
(sometimes their parents), to “stay in your own lane” in order to achieve a 
desired result.

sales of Cialis from the time of FDA approval to the present: 33/

Notice the peak from 2016 to the gradual drop in revenue as the 
Cialis patent begins to expire.  Moreover, the main Cialis 
competitor, Viagra, lost its patent five years earlier, thus 
permitting a cheaper generic version of the PDE5 inhibitor into 
the marketplace to drive prices down.

One of the many unintended consequences of the LID is 
that it removes an important incentive for powerful drug 
manufacturing corporations to behave responsibly.  
The Federal Government reported in 2006 that the 
pharmaceutical industry had spent more on DTC advertising 
than it had spent on research and development.  34/   
Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendant (and other 
drug manufacturers) withheld knowledge of the dangerous side-
effect of ICH when taking PDE5 inhibiters and did so 
deliberately to generate maximum revenue and worry later 
about paying damages.   
 As was observed by a California Appellate Court: 
[T]he manufacturer may find it more profitable to 
treat compensatory damages as a part of the cost of 
doing business rather than to remedy the defect. 
 
Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 119 Cal. App.3d 757, 174 
Cal. Rptr. 348 (1981).

Advertising 5, 12 (Nov. 2006).

35 
 
Perhaps the Defendant and other manufacturers of PDE5 
inhibiters thought it more profitable to keep quiet about ICH 35/ 
and “treat compensatory damages as a part of the cost of doing 
business.”  Grimshaw. 
During the time Defendant enjoyed the privilege of the 
LID, it ventured into a different lane on the highway of 
commerce: the lane reserved for safe (which Cialis certainly is 
not) products requiring little deliberation to purchase, while 
enjoying the windfall profits beneath the protective wing of the 
LID. 
Defendant and other manufactures could not have 
generated such windfall profits marketing PDE5 inhibiters if it 
warned the public and physicians about the side-effect of ICH. 
                                          
35/ Defendant stated as much in its 2017 financial reporting: “Because of 
the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large 
numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the 
future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if 
involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product.”

Had the LID not been available as a carte blanche for the 
Defendant to evade the general requirement to warn the public 
of dangerous side-effects, its DTC advertising would have 
included a warning against a possible ICH when ingesting 
Cialis.  With the LID in force Defendant gives little or no 
regard to the potential legal consequences of causing 
debilitating drug injuries with its refusal to warn about the 
danger of ICH, so it yet continues to market Cialis with 
impunity.   
In the case of PDE5 inhibiters, the LID hinders the 
patient-doctor relationship, encourages patients to choose drug-
based solutions over lifestyle-based ones, it reduces the amount 
spent on research and development, and increases spending on 
drugs without a corresponding health benefit. 36/

(2) A DTC Exception to LID Would Not Create a Chilling 
      Effect 
 
The worst kept secret among the more fierce advocates of 
the LID is the fear that important drug discoveries will no 
longer be forthcoming if the pharmaceutical industry loses the 
financial incentive or freedom to experiment.  Those advocates 
call this a “chilling effect” on the Pharmaceutical Industry’s 
ability to discover new drug therapies. 
Some commentators (that might possibly be on the 
pharmaceutical industry payroll) have sung like troubadours of 
the virtues of the LID and lament over the possibility of a world 
without new drug research if courts take one step toward 
limiting the LID for drug companies that utilize DTC 
advertising. 37/

Consumer Pharmaceutical Advertising on the Learned Intermediary 
Doctrine, (1997), 20 Campbell L. Rev. 113.

Plaintiffs submit that as long as capitalism remains alive 
and well in this country, the profit motive will continue to 
generate entrepreneurship, even within the pharmaceutical 
industry.  “The profit motive is the engine that ensures the 
progress of science." American Geophysical Union v. Texaco 
Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (S.D.N.Y.  1992), aff'd, 60 F.3d 913 
(2nd Cir. 1994).   
 
C.  This Case Demands Authorizing of Punitive Damages 
 
 
Because Defendant has acted to withhold disclosure that 
Cialis can cause ICH, this Court should determine that the 
actions of Defendant were so egregious as to warrant punitive 
damages. 
 
The United States District Court has broadened the scope 
 
 of the certified question to include: 
 
 . . . consideration of any other issues that it 
determines 
are 
relevant. 
Moreover, 
the 
Washington Supreme Court may, in its discretion, 
reformulate the question in whatever manner it 
finds most appropriate. See Affiliated FM Ins. Co.

VI.  CONCLUSION 
Mapping of the complete human genome marked an 
important milestone in medical discovery. 38/ As a result of that 
achievement, drugs can someday be engineered to fit each 
individual according to his or her own genetic profile.       
As we prepare to cross that threshold we need now, more 
than ever, a robust pharmaceutical industry to meet the 
challenging demands of the twenty-first century.  But that need 
does not override our need for the pharmaceutical industry to 
behave responsibly. 
By limiting the reach of the learned intermediary 
doctrine, this Court will put drug manufactures on notice, that 
those doing business in the State of Washington that “change

lanes” in order to increase revenue using DTC marketing, will 
no longer enjoy the protection of the LID to market their 
product directly to the public, that they must disclose all and 
every dangerous side effects at the time of their marketing.

lntracerebral 
haemorrhage associated 
with sildenafil citrate 
Received: 15 February 2000 
Received in revised form: 8 June 2000 
Accepted: 25 July 2000 
Sirs: Sildenafil is an orally active, 
potent and selective inhibitor of 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), 
an important regulator of cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
in the human corpus cavernosum 
which has recently been introduced 
for the treatment of erectile dys-
function. Sildenafil acts by increas-
ing the concentration of cGMP in 
the corpus cavernosum smooth 
muscle cells leading to muscle re-
laxation, vasodilatation and penile 
erection [!].Adverse effects in-
clude headache, visual and retinal 
disturbances, dizziness and a 
pupil-sparing third nerve palsy (2, 
5, 7]. We report a patient who de-
veloped intracerebral haemorrhage 
(ICH) after sildenafil consumption. 
A 67-year-old dentist was re-
ferred to our clinic in a confusional 
state together with speech, numer-
acy and memory disturbances. 
From the history it appeared that 
5 days before admission, approxi-
mately 30 minutes after the inges-
tion of one tablet of sildenafil 
25 mg, the patient complained of 
headache, confusion and nervous-
ness without improvement in sex-
ual function. One hour after the 
ingestion of the first tablet the 
patient took another 25 mg tablet, 
again without sexual intercourse. 
According to his wife, these symp-
toms increased together with lan-
guage difficulty. The patient was 
admitted to our department 5 days 
later. He had never used sildenafil 
before. The history revealed no ar-
terial hypertension or migraine or 
haemostatic risk factors (e.g. use of 
anticoagulants or antiplatelet 
drugs, thrombolytic treatment), 
history of head trauma, hypercho-
lesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
or cerebrovascular episodes such as 
stroke or transient ischaemic at-
tacks. There was no family history 
of cerebral arteriovenous malfor-
mation, intracerebral aneurysms, 
or intracerebral haemorrhages. He 
had a 40-year history of tobacco 
abuse (approximately 15 cigarettes 
a day) and denied regular alcohol 
intake. He took no other medica-
tions. 
On admission his blood pres-
sure was 140/90 mmHg and pulse 
was 68/min. Neurological examina-
tion showed a right superior 
homonymous quadrantopsia and 
psychiatric examination a dyspho-
retic mood. Ophthalmoscopic ex-
amination was normal. Neuropsy-
chological testing revealed a 
moderate impairment of compre-
Fig. 1 Axial Tl-weighted gadolinium-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging shows hyperintense 
signal lesion confined subcortically to the left tempo-
ral lobe 
hension, naming, reading and writ-
ing with a relative sparing of repe-
tition, acalculia, finger agnosia, 
colour anomia, and discrete in-
volvement of episodic memory. 
Routine blood examination, 
platelet count and coagulation fac-
tors were normal, as well as elec-
trocardiography, and colour-coded 
duplex sonography of extracranial 
vessels. Transcranial colour-coded 
duplex sonography revealed a 
sharply demarcated hypere-
chogenic area confined to the left 
temporal lobe. Two days after ad-
mission basal and gadolinium-en-
hanced Tl-/T2-weighted cerebral 
magnetic resonance imaging re-
vealed a large left temporal subcor-
tical haemorrhage with moderate 
surrounding oedema (see Fig. l). 
Although the chance of finding a 
clinically relevant vascular lesion in 
a patient 67 years old is very small, 
we would have liked to have per-
formed cerebral angiography. How-
ever, the patient's wife, informed of 
the potential risk of cerebral an-
giography, refused her consent due 
to her husband's advanced age and 
the presence of a deep lobar ICH. 
The patient was treated with intra-
venous bolus of 1 g/kg mannitol, 
followed by 0.5 g/kg every 4 h for 
7 days. He was discharged 5 days 
later with mild comprehension, 
reading, writing and episodic 
memory deficits, moderate acalcu-
lia, finger agnosia and colour 
anomia. The field defect was still 
present. 
The close temporal relationship 
between sildenafil ingestion and 
onset of the neurological symp-
toms due to the ICH in a patient 
without a history of cerebrovascu-
lar accident or obvious risk factors 
for ICH suggest that sildenafil was 
causally related to the ICH. Smok-
ing is currently not considered a 
primary risk factor for ICH [4, 6].

as the precipitating factor. Com-
mon adverse effects of sildenafil, 
such as flushing, headache and 
nasal congestion, indicate that va-
sodilatation is not confined to the 
corpus cavernosum [5]. On the 
other hand, the reported occur-
rence of acute myocardial infarc-
tion suggests that the drug may 
also act by redistributing the arter-
ial blood flow, in turn reducing ves-
sel perfusion [3 ]. The reported oc-
currence of headache, dizziness, 
visual disturbances, retinal dys-
function and a pupil-sparing third 
nerve palsy suggest that sildenafil 
also affects brain microvasculature 
regulation [2, 5, 7]. Recently, Bal-
lard et al. [ 1] in an in vitro study 
have shown that sildenafil, in addi-
tion to a selective action on PDE-5, 
may also act on other two PDEs 
(i.e. PDE-1 and PDE-2) which are 
involved in the control of cerebral 
vasculature. In our case a particu-
lar susceptibility to the drug may 
have led to an abnormal, persistent 
vasodilatation of cerebral arteries 
and to an abnormal redistribution 
of arterial brain blood flow. Fur-
thermore, our patient took a sec-
ond 25 mg tablet within 1 h of in-
gestion of the first one, despite the 
manufacturer's advice suggesting 
that the initial sildenafil dose in the 
elderly should be 25 mg. These fac-
tors may have increased the risk of 
a bleeding phenomenon in a sub-
ject with a senescent cerebral cir-
culation. As cerebral angiography 
was not carried out in our patient, 
it remains unclear to what extent 
pre-existing cerebral microvascular 
disease contributed to the onset of 
ICH. However, although less accu-
rate than cerebral angiography, 
brain magnetic resonance imaging 
and transcranial colour-coded du-
plex sonography did not show any 
cerebral malformations. 
In conclusion, our case and the 
frequency of reported vascular ad-
verse effects suggest that sildenaftl 
should be used with caution in the 
elderly, especially when the mini-
mum dose recommended by the 
manufacturer does not improve 
sexual function to first-time users. 
Longitudinal pharmacological 
studies in an elderly population are 
necessary to clarify this issue.

APPENDIX -3 
Coital Hemorrhage of an Arteriovenous Malformation after 
Premedication with Tadalafil (Cialis) 
Thomas D.L. Steeves, MD,* Lyell K. Jones, MD,* Robert D. Ecker, MD,t 
and Edward M. Manno, MD* 
Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction. However, the results on the cerebral vasculature are unknown. Several 
cases of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the setting of PDE 5 inhibitor use have been 
reported. The effect of these agents on the risk of arteriovenous malformation (A VM) 
hemorrhage is speculative. This report illustrates a possible association between 
tadalafil (Cialis, Lilly ICOS, Indianapolis, IN), a new long-acting PDE 5 inhibitor, and 
A VM hemorrhage during coitus. A 59-year-old male suffered a coital intraparenchy-
mal hemorrhage after premedication with tadalafil. Angiography and magnetic reso-
nance imaging demonstrated an underlying right temporoparital A VM. The A VM was 
excised, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. A VMs are felt to be dynamic 
lesions that evolve in response to changes in blood flow. Repeated use of PDE 5 
inhibitors could induce changes in an A VM that would make it more likely to 
hemorrhage, particularly in the setting of additional stress from coitus and elevated 
blood pressure. The potential for risk of devastating neurovascular complications 
related to PDE 5 inhibitors should be monitored. Key Words: Coital hemorrhage-
arteriovenous maJformation- tadalafil.

More than 100 million men worldwide suffer from 
erectile dysfunction. In 1998, sildenafil citrate (Viagra), 
the first oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor 
for the treatment of this condition, was approved. Since 
its introduction, sildenafil has been prescribed to more 
than 15 million men worldwide. 1 Its sales approach $US 
2 billion annually in a market whose value is expected to 
reach $US 6 billion by the end of the decade.2 In 2003, the 
FDA approved 2 new PDE 5 inhibitors: vardenafil (Lev-
itra, Bayer, Pittsburg, PA), distinguished from sildenafil 
by greater biochemical potency, and tadalafil (Cialis, Lilly 
!COS), which is unique for its prolonged half-life and 
extended window of efficacy.

PDE 5 is an isoenzyme of a family of cGMP hydrolyz-
ing enzymes. It is located in vascular smooth muscle cells 
of the penile corpus cavernosum, as well as in various 
other human tissues, including the brain and cerebral 
arteries. In the corpus cavem osum, inhibitors of this 
enzyme permit cGMP to accumulate after its production 
in response to sexual arousal, which in tum relaxes the 
smooth muscle of the penile vasculature to allow vaso-
dilatation and erection. The effect of these agents on the 
cerebral vasculature is unclear. Although PDE 5 inhibi-
tors are not known to confer an increased risk of central 
nervous system hemorrhage, several cases of intraparen-
chymal hemorrhage associated with their use have been 
documented. Here we describe a case of coital hemor-
rhage of an arteriovenous malformation (A VM) after 
premedication with tadalafil.

sided headache during intercourse. Two months before 
this incident, his primary care physician had prescribed 
tadalafil for erectile dysfunction, and the patient had 
used this medication several times with favorable results 
and no adverse effects. On this occasion he had ta.ken 10 
mg of tadalafil 2 hours before intercourse. He experi-
enced no neurologic symptoms until intercourse, at 
which time he had an abrupt onset of a 9/10 right-sided 
posterior parietal headache. He discontinued his activity 
and took an asprin as well as fexofenadine (Allegra, 
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) for nasal con-
gestion. He sought medical attention when his headache 
did not improve after approximately 1 hour. 
On initial examination at his local hospital, the patient 
was found to be neurologically intact. However, a head 
computed tomography scan revealed an acute 3.5 cm X 
4.5 cm x 6.5 cm bleed in the right temporoparietal area. 
The patient was transferred to the neurologic intensive 
care unit at our institution for further management. On 
arrival, his only neurologic deficits were a mild left 
pronator drift and an inconsistent visual field exam by 
confrontation that suggested a possible left homonymous 
hemianopsia. 
Cerebral angiography (Fig 1) demonstrated a small 
A VM located in the superficial aspect of the posterior 
right temporal lobe fed by a branch of the angular artery. 
A single superficial draining vein ascended laterally to 
empty into the superior sagittal sinus. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) (Fig 2) showed a 4.2 cm X 4.8 cm X

tered within the right temporal lobe and extending into 
the most anterior aspect of the right parietal lobe. Multi-
ple enlarged vessels were seen in the sylvian fissure, as 
well as the previously noted superficial draining vein to 
the superior sagittal sinus. Formal visual field testing 
confinned a complete left hemianopsia. The patient was 
taken to surgery, and the A VM was excised. He had an 
uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 
home with a resolving left-sided hemianopsia as his only 
remaining neurologic deficit. 
Discussion 
A number of adverse neurologic events are associated 
with sexual intercourse. Benign coital headache, vertebral 
and carotid artery dissection, and subarachnoid hemor-
rhage during coitus are all well known to neurosurgeons 
and neurologists. However, documentation of these 
events has been limited. Finelli3 reported a case of hem-
orrhage of a probable cavernous malformation during 
sexual intercourse in a hypertensive patient. More re-
cently, several cases of intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
associated with sildenafil citrate, both with and without 
intercourse, have been described . Monastero et al4 re-
ported a lobar hemorrhage associated with sildenafil but 
without intercourse. Buxton et al5 described a lobar hem-
orrhage after intercourse and premedication with silde-
nafil that ultimately resulted in the patient's death. Most 
recently, Marti and Masso6 described a midbrain hemor-
rhage occurring after premedication with sildenafil and 
intercourse, although the exact onset of symptoms in

as in the large superficinl draining vein (white arrow) to the superior

APPENDIX -5 
COITAL HEMORRHAGE 
relation to these events was not described. To our knowl-
edge, no coital hemorrhage of an A VM in association 
with tadalafil, has yet been reported. 
Our patient was a 59-year-old man with a history of 
moderate hypertension and an underlying A VM whose 
hemorrhage occurred during intercourse and after pre-
medication with tadalafil. Given that the hemodynamic 
determinants of A VM hemorrhage have not been de-
fined, to what extent these factors may have interacted to 
increase this patient's risk of hemorrhage is open to 
speculation. 
Coitus is well known to have a marked effect on blood 
pressure in both normal and hypertensive subjects. Con-
tinuous intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring in am-
bulant hypertensive subjects has shown peaks values of 
up to 300/175 mmHg during intercourse, with a mean of 
237 /138 for men and 216/127 for women.7 In this con-
text, it is possible that extreme hypertension alone trig-
gered this man's hemorrhage, but the potential contribu-
tion of tadalafil to the presentation, whether directly or 
even indirectly by permitting him to engage in inter-
course, also should be considered. 
The adverse effect profile of all PDE 5 inhibitors is 
similar and includes headache, facial flushing, gastro-
esophageal reflux, nasal congestion, and visual distur-
bances. Tadalafil is also associated with myalgias and 
back pain, although the mechanism behind these symp-
toms is unclear. The effects of these agents on the intra-
cranial vasculature are still being elucidated. Tadalafil 
has greater selectivity than sildenafil for PDE 5 compared 
with the other PDE isoenzymes.1-6'8 But Kruuse et al9 
have shown that PDE 5 is present in the cerebral arteries 
of both rodents and humans, and that in vitro rodent 
cerebral arteries dilate in response to PDE inhibitors. 
However, in a more recent human study evaluating the 
effects of sildenafil on cerebral blood flow, Kruuse et al10 
detected no changes in middle cerebral artery diameter as 
measured with Doppler ultrasound and no change in 
cerebral blood flow as measured with single-photon 
emission computed tomography. 
The potential effects of the PDE inhibitors on A VM 
likewise have not been established; however, increased 
blood flow is known to produce progressive vessel 
changes in experimental models of A VMs. Tears in the 
internal elastic lamina of the afferent artery occur after 
2-5 days of high flow, and further changes progress to 
involve all layers of the vessel to the point where it can no 
181 
longer be identified as an artery or a vein.11 It remains 
possible that repeated use of PDEs, particularly those 
with prolonged half-lives such as tadalafil, could induce 
changes in an A VM that would make it more likely to 
hemorrhage when additional stresses from exertion and 
elevated blood pressure were placed on it. This is pre-
cisely the scenario that would be repeated time and again 
with the chronic use of tadalafil in sexual intercourse. 
Given the increasing popularity of these agents and the 
potential for their widespread use and abuse as perfor-
mance enhancers even among relatively young individ-
uals who do not suffer from erectile dysfunction, the risk 
of devastating neurovascular complication should be 
monitored.

Sudden deafness from stroke 
To the Editor: I was fascina ted by the re port by Leussink et al.' 
and b ow their patient, following a stroke, became s uddenly and 
totally deaf, but h ad no r ealization tha t this was the case. This 
s ingula r unconscious ness of a deficit is reminiscent of Anton syn-
drome, in whjch pa tie nts with cortical blindness may not only fail 
to realize tha t they ar e blind, but strenuously maintain that they 
can see perfectly. Whe n , as inevitably happe ns, they blunder into 
objects, they immedia tely explain s uch accide nts by confa bula -
tions ("the furniture h as been moved," "the light is bad"). One is 
tempted to see Le ussink and colleagues' case as an example of 
a uditory Anton syndrome. It would be valua ble to h a ve more 
informa tion a bout this patient. How, for exa mple, did sh e explain 
h er inability to under st and people's s peech? Did sh e confabulate 
r eason s for this, like som eone with Anton syndrom e? And wha t, in

Visual field defect and intracerebral h emorrhage 
associated with u se of vardenafil (Levitra) 
To the Editor: McGee et al. ' re port a case of intracer ebral hem-
orrhage (ICH) with vardenafil in a 66-year-old Ca ucasia n male 
with erectile dysfunction (ED) who h ad previously used sildenafil. 
This e vent h as to be viewed within the context of the occurre nce of 
ICH tha t b as been reported with the other currently availa ble 
pbosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors . 
As a point of comparison , McGee et al. cited two reported cases 
of ICH associated with silde n afil , with a third case r eported in 
2004.2 In contrast, there was one case of ICH with tadalafil, which 
was recently reported.8 These five reports cite cases of ICH associ-
a t ed with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. 
Worldwide utilization data for sildenafil and tada lafil and US 
data for vardenafil totals a pproximately 18.5 million men who 
have used a PDE-5 inhibitor for ED (according to informa tion 
from the McGee article, a Medical News Today news brief da ted 
June 3, 2004 availa ble at www .m edica lnew s today.com/ne ws-
search .php?newsid -9046, and a press r elease dated F ebruary 26, 
2004 availa ble at www.gsk.com). 
The worldwide incidence of ICH has been estima ted to range 
from 10 to 20 cases pe r 100,000 population; in the US, the annual 
incidence of ICH (adjusted for age, sex, a nd race) is estimated at 
15 cases per 100,000 population.•·• Used as a point of reference, 
these number s sh ow th a t the risk of ICH among p atients usi ng 
the currently a vaila ble PDE-5 inhibitors for ED is not consider-
a bly differ ent from the gener al popula tion. 
The issue of causality a nd association of vardenafil with ICH 
m ay be difficult to ascertain in this pa tien t in the McGee article 
because oftbe following confounders: a lthough rare, ICH has been 
r eported for all 3 PDE-5 inhibitors; the specific doses and dura tion 
of ther a py with the previously used PDE -5 inhibitor (silde na fil) 
were not given; although no his tory of drug use was m entioned , a 
toxicology screen was not conducted ; and a multiplicity of risk 
factors a re involved in the e tiology of ICH3. 
Correspondence 
did not fully realize tha t this was part of the more general prob-
lem of n ot being able to hear at all. 
While under investigation for a uditory brainstem potentials, 
s he would take off the headphones and look a t them as if to say 
"Wha t is this for?" or "Wha t do you expect me to do with it?" She 
would the n stand up from the examination ch a ir and w alk a way. 
Concurrently, there was additional difficulty in comm unication , 
which we la ter formally establi sh ed as a moder ate fluent Wer-
nicke type of a phasia. In this context, sh e would lat er r e peat part 
of the sentences said to her (always with a question tone as if sh e 
was still uncertain of wbat sh e h ad grasped ). On dictation, sh e 
much preferred to write down the end of sente nces and missed the 
beginning as if the auditory system (or verbal understanding) 
needed to be slowly tuned up. 
The condition s ubstantially improved within 24 hours a nd s ub-
sequ ently continued to improve. After a few days she told people 
who set out to communicate with her tha t sh e could not hear well. 
H er premorbid below average level ofinterngence proba bly did not 
permit h er to carefully r eflect and communica t e the more complex 
nature of her initial problem. We have no r ecollection of h er inter-
pretation of the initial type of disturbance. 
From a ll these features, we firmly believe that the patient a t 
least initially h ad a cortical dysfunction tha t went beyond simple 
hearin g loss. H owever , with a phasia interfering we ar e n ot certajn 
that t h er e was substa ntial anosognosia associated with it.

Reply from the Authors: We a ppreciate Dr. H ells trom's r e-
s ponse t o our article' and agree with a ll of his points. When 
assessing whether or not a side effect is r elated to a m edica tion, 
timing of onset of symptoms in rela tion to ingestion of drug is 
important in addition to whether symptom s r ecur whe n the pa-
tient takes the drug again . Today, serious side e ffects of m edica-
tion s a r e difficult to prove sin ce patients are r eluctant to r e-
challenge them selves with a drug th ey believe was implica t ed in 
causing their symptoms. Therefore, we are left with the timing of 
onset of symptoms t o ingestion. 
Although we, the a uthors, ar e a t a loss to h ypothesize a mech -
a nism of ca usation of ICH in our patient, our intention was to 
a lert the m edical community to this possible associa tion through 
publication .

Excess of serum copper not related to 
ceru.loplasD1in in Alzheimer disease 
To the Editor: I read with interest the article by Squitti et al.• I 
am u ncertain of t he significance of the non-ce r uloplasrnin bound 
copper in the serum of Alzheimer patients. Is it simply a conse-
q ue nce of Alzheimer disease (AD) activity or is directly impl icated 
in the disease process? 
AD a ppear s to have free copper unbound by ceruloplas min in 
increased amounts . This may have clinical i·mplications since 
treatment with clioquinol, a m etal-protein-atten uating compound 
wlricb inlribits zinc a nd copper ions from binding to Abeta and 
promotes Abeta dissolution, r esulted in minima l deterior ation of 
cognitive scores in treated patients compared to s ubstan t ial d ete-
rioration .in patients treated with placebo.2 
D e pleted copper levels have been noted to r educe APP produc-
tion in anim als and it is thought the APP regulation of production 
m ay represent a target for treatment of AD.3 The amyloidogenic 
pathway for Abeta pe ptides is initiated by BACEl. BACEl inter-
acts with the copper chaperone for s u peroxide dism utase-1 a nd 
reduces activity of superoxide dismutase through competition for 
availa ble copper chaperone for s uperoxide dismutase.• 
Intracellular copper h om eostasis is very regulated, since free 
cu prous ions react with hydroge n peroxide to yield hydroxyl radi-
cal. Copper is imported by plasma m embr ane transport protein 
a nd r apidly binds to in tracellular copper chaperone proteins. 
Amyloid precursor protein may be a copper chaperone protein ' 
a nd defective-free cuprous ions would be available to react with 
hydroxyl radical, a potent oxidative agent. Copper may interact 
with multiple mechanis ms implicated in AD.

rioxa rnine• has demonstrated act u al disease slowing effects, while 
a similar tre nd has also been sh own with th e use of clioquinol.2 
However , treatment duration appears to be a fundame ntaJ factor, 
as can it be expected with disease modifying compounds ra ther 
th an symptomatic a pproaches. 
The administr ation of clioquinol to AD patients for 36 weeks 
has provided encouraging results, yet these have been far Jess 
important than those obtained by the use of desferrioxamjne for 
24 months. In addition, a 24-week tr ial with D -pe nk illa mine' 
showed positive effects in reducing, during the administration 
phase, the oxidative stress that was present at baselin e in AD 
patients However , a significant cognitive effect coul d not be dem-
onstrated in this short observation period due mostly to lack of 
measu ra b le cognitive deterioration in t he placebo group. 
We agree with Dr . Brenner tha t copper is meta bolica lly very 
finely regula ted by th e organism and t hat is precisely why we 
believe that even a s mall increase of t h e serum low molecular 
weight component can be of a great significance, particularly over 
a long period of time. When copper is bound to low molecular weight 
copper compounds, it can be easily exchanged among albumin and 
small transporter molecules such as peptides or aminoacids.8 Tlris 
!ability can potentially render copper more toxic and promote oxida-
tive stress, which is significant because these low molecular weight 
components can easily cross the blood brain barrier . 
The putative chaperone role of the Amyloid Precursor P rotein 
(APP) has been shown and may be confirmed by our recent obser-
vations (m a nuscript in preparation) demonstrating a relationslrip 
between serum levels of copper unbound to ceruloplasmin and 
bet a amyloid in th e cerebrospinal fluid in AD patien ts.

lntracerebral hemorrhage 
associated with sildenafil 
use: a case report

Sirs: lntracerebral hemorrhage 
(!CH) accounts for approximately 
IO % of all strokes and carries high 
morbidity and mortality. Causes of 
nonhypertensive intracerebral 
hemorrhage are arteriovenous 
malformations, aneurysms, amy-
loid angiopathy, coagulopathies 
and drugs. Drug-induced !CH 
occurs mostly due to anticoagu-
lants, thrombolytics, sympath-
omimetics, metamphetamine and 
cocaine. To our knowledge, there 
are two previous reported cases 
about the relationship between 
sildenafil use and !CH [1,2]. Here 
we report a case of !CH after a 
single dose of sildenafil use. 
A 62-year-old, right-handed 
male was admitted with left-sided 
weakness and numbness. He re-
ported that he had taken 50 mg of 
sildenafil two hours previously and 
had noticed numbness and weak-
ness in his left arm and leg an hour 
after taking the drug. This was the 
first time he used the drug which 
was prescribed by a urologist He 
indicated that the symptoms devel-

oped before any attempt for sexual 
intercourse which rules out the 
possibility of sexual exertion being 
the precipitating factor. On admis-
sion, his blood pressure was 
150/90 mmHg and on neurological 
examination left hemiparesis, 
hemihypoesthesia, and hemihy-
poalgesia were evident. Cranial CT 
and MRI showed hemorrhage in 
the right thalamus, and the poste-
rior limb of the internal capsule 
(Fig. 1 ). Intracranial and extracra-
nial MRA were normal. He had a 
history of mild hypertension but he 
was not on any antihypertensive 
treatment. The patient was admit-
ted to the stroke unit and antihy-
pertensive treatment was initiated. 
Systolic blood pressure was be-
tween 120- 150 mm Hg and diastolic 
between 80- 90 mm Hg during his 
stay. Neurological status improved 
in one week and at discharge, he 
only had mild clumsiness of the left 
hand. 
Sildenafil is a selective phospho-
diesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. As a 
result of PDE-5 inhibition, cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (c 
GMP) increases in the vascular 
smooth muscle of corpus caver-
nosum, leading to muscle relax-
ation and vasodilation. Several 
studies have shown that NO- cGMP 
pathway may be responsible for 
cerebral vasodilation by similar 
mechanisms [3] . Recently, Ballard 
et al. have suggested that sildenafil 
acts on PDE-I and PDE-2 which 
are involved in the control of cere-
bral vasculature [4]. The increase 
in the blood flow may have raised 
the risk of !CH. 
Furthermore, it is advised that 
the initial sildenafil dose in the 
elderly should be 25 mg. Our pa-
tient had taken 50 mg of the drug 
as the initial dose which might 
have been another factor increas-
ing the risk of !CH. Sildenafil may 
be the cause of the intracranial 
bleeding in our patient although a 
chance association cannot be ruled 
out.

INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE ASSOCI -
ATED WITH USE OF TADALAFIL (CIALIS) 
T adalafil (Cialis; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is 
used to treat erectile dysfunction in men. The 
most common adverse effects reported include 
headache, dizziness, minor visual changes, and 
ischemic optic neuropathy. 1 We describe a patient 
who developed inrracerebral hemorrhage after 
taking two tablets of tadalafil 20 mg. 
Case report. 
A 70-year-old man presented to 
our emergency department with headache, nau-
sea, and vomiting lasti ng for 4 days. He was 
anxious a nd confused , with memory distur-
bances, but neurologic examination was other-
wise normal. His medical history included 
prostate ca ncer, erectile dysfunction, a nd de-
pression. There was no history of hypertension, 
head trauma, or prior cerebrovascular disease 
(stroke/T IA), and no underlying vascular or he-
mostatic risk factors. Blood pressure and pulse 
measured were 132/65 mm Hg and 78 bpm. A 
head CT sca n without contrast showed an in-
tracercbral hemorrhage (2 X 4 cm in diameter) 
in the right temporal lobe (figure, A). During 
admission the patient volunteered that he had 
taken two tablets of tadalafi l 20 mg (total 40 
Notes 
mg) to enhance his sexual performance 1 hour 
before onset of his acute headache and that his 
symptoms worsened moderately during his sex-
ua l intercourse. A head CT angiography showed 
no vascular anomalies or malformations. The pa-
tient was discharged after 7 days with no further 
headache and improvement of his neurologic 
symptoms. A brain MRI/angiography performed 
1 month after admission revealed the hypointense 
lesion with a surrounding rim of hyperinrensiry 
on Tl-weighted images, with no contra t en-
hancement and no evidence of underlying vascu-
lar malformation (figure, B). 
Discussion. 
Tadalafi l (Cialis), sildenafil (Vi-
agra, Pfizer Ltd.), and va rdenafil hydrochloride 
(Levitra, Bayer Pharmaceuti cal Corp. ) are 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhi bitors ap-
proved for the treatment of erectile dysfunc-
tion: they enhance penile erection by relaxing 
smooth muscles and increasing blood fl ow in 
the corpus cavernosum. Various side effects as-
sociated with the use of these medications have 
been reported: headache, facia l flushing, hypo-
tension, and dizziness. Minor visual changes 
and ischemic optic neuropathy with subsequent 
loss of vision are also described as side effects 
of th ese drugs.' Rare hemorrh agic adverse

events include epistax is and bleeding from 
esophageal varices and from hemorrhoids.2 Ce-
rebrovascu lar hemo rrhage is extremely rare, 
but has been described after ingestion of si lde-
nafil and verdenafil.3·5 Although cerebral amy-
loid a ngiopathy 1s 
a potential cause of 
intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly, in o ur 
patient's history there was no genetic risk fac-
tor and no evidence of old petechial bleeds on 
MRI; the onset of neurologic symptoms within 
a narrow time window after ra king radalafil 
suggests the hypothesis of a strict correlation 
between hemorrhage and drug ab use. In o ur 
case, we hypothesize that the abuse of this drug 
may have a ltered cerebra l autoregulation with 
resu ltant abnormal cerebral arterial vasodilara-
tion fo ll owed by regional cerebra l ischemia, in-
farction, and subsequent hemo rrh age. Only 
three case reports of intracerebral hemorrhage 
after PDE5 inhibitor medications have been de-
scribed ; our case suggests that tadalafil should 
be used at the dose recommended by the manu-
facturer. In o ur case, the trigger for intracere-
bra l hemo rrh age appea rs to have been the 
ingestion of two ta blets of tadalafil 20 mg, de-
spite the manufacturer's advice (recommended 
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT INVOLVEMENT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 3243A > G MITO-
CHONDRIAL DNA MUTATION 
Defects of the mitochondrial genome {mtD A) are 
increasingly recognized as common causes of neuro-
logic syndromes.' One of the most common patho-
genic mtD A mutations is the m.3243A>G in the 
MTTL1 gene. In addition to numerous neurologic 
features this mutation can also give rise to gastroin-
testinal symptoms including bloating, dysphagia, re-
current vomiting and anorexia, chronic diarrhea, 
and gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction.2_, To gain 
insight into the pathophysiology of gastrointes-
tinal symptoms associated with the m.3243A>G 
mtDNA mutation, we investigated the degree of re-
spiratory chain deficiency and the level of 
m.3243A>G mutation in individual areas from the 
gastrointestinal tract of two patients in whom gas-
trointestinal symptoms were both prominent and 
difficult to manage.

of the mitochondrial myoparhy, encephalopathy,

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra" ; Pfeizer US Pharmaceutical Group, New York, NY, USA) is a potent vasodilating agent to treat male erectile 
dysfunction. Among its adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke has not been widely reported yet. We present a case of a 33-year-old healthy man 
who ingested 50 mg sildenafil a half hour before onset of headache, nervousness and speech disturbance. Head computed tomogram of this 
stuporous man showed huge intracerebral hemorrhage and thick subarachnoid hemorrhage, but angiography failed to disclose any vascular 
anomalies. Subsequent surgical procedure was followed, and rehabilitation was provided thereafter. Sildenafil seems to act by redistributing 
arterial blood flow, and concurrent sympathetic hyperactivity, which lead to such hemorrhagic presentation. Extreme caution should be paid on 
even in a young adult male patient wven without known risk factors.

INTRODUCTION 
For a decade, sildenafi.l citrate (Viagra"; Pfeizer US Phar-
maceutical Group, New York, NY, USA) has become one 
of the top-selling product in the world-wide market for ma.le 
impotence treatment. Since its first introduction however, 
numerous adverse effects have been reported, and parricular 
anention should be paid upon when prescription is consi-
dered. With regard to intracerebra.l hemorrhage (ICH), 
there are only four English written literatures 1•4•9•10l. All of 
these cases showed minimal-to-moderate degree hemor-
rhage with unremarkable recovery. 
We experienced a case of massive ICH associated with 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) requiring surgical removal. 
This young ma.le parient did not have any risk factors for 
hemorrhage. A detailed case report and possible pachophy-
siologic explanarions are presented.

CASE REPORT 
A 33-year-old man was brought in to the Emergency 
Room for sudden unconsciousness following paroxysmal 
headache, nervousness and speech disturbance of two-hour 
durarion. Approximately a ha.If hour prior to symptom onset, 
he ingested one tablet of 50 mg si.ldenafiJ citrate to anempt 
sexual intercourse, but he could not. 
Although he was slightly overweight (178 cm, 88 kg), he 
had been healthy and free of any significant medical history, 
including arterial hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, 
migraine, pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
diseases. He took no ocher medications, except episodic 
common-cold remedies. He had a 15-year history of tobacco 
smoking (approximately 1 pack per day), and ingested 
irregular alcohol about two times per week, presumably 
more than social drinking. He had been married 35 days 
before this event, and had taken sildenaftl citrate 25 mg for 
two times during recent 2 weeks chat were prescribed by a 
urologist. His wife denied any similar symptoms when used 
previously. 
On admission, he was profoundly stuporous, densely quap-
riparetic (Grade 3/Grade 1), and had fully dilated pupils. 
Vital signs showed high blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg,

rapid pulse rate (108/min) and respiration (24/min), and 
fever up to 38.YC , respectively. Brain computed tomo-
graphy (CD showed a huge ICH on the right basal ganglia, 
intraventricular clots and thick SAH (Fig. 1). A CT angio-
graphy and trasnfemoral catheter angiography (TFCA) 
failed to disclose any vascular lesion on the corresponding 
hemisphere (Fig. 2). 
Because of impending herniation, we hurried him into 
the operating room for decompression. Following dural 
reflection, swollen brain was encountered, and prompt 
temporal corticectomy was conducted to find organizing 
hematoma. After gentle suction and irrigation of hema-
toma, the sylvian fissure was widely split to show most 
course of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). From 
distal portion, the MCA was thoroughly inspected up to 
the proximal MCA, but we could not find any aneurysmal 
dilatation or other angiomatous lesions. Meticulous hemo-
stasis and expansive duroplasty was done. Skull flap was not 
covered to control raised intracranial pressure. 
Postoperatively, he remained stuporous, but motor func-
tion was slightly improved (Grade 5/Grade 1). While in the 
intensive care unit stay, blood laboratory tests and serologic 
tests were undertaken, but there were no proven clues for 
the incracranial bleeding. Afterwards, robust rehabilitation 
was followed, and cerebrospinal fluid diversion and cranio-
plascy was performed for delayed hydrocephalus and skull 
defect, at postoperative 40 days (Fig. 3). At the last follow-
up visit, 18 months postoperatively, he regained conscious-
ness, was able to communicate with care givers in restricted 
extent, but was still hemiparetic (Grade 5/Grade 3) on 
wheel-chair and dependent for commanding major acti-
vities of daily living. 
DISCUSSION 
Causes of ICH in a non-hypertensive subject are largely 
divided into structural vascular anomalies (arceriovenous 
malformation, aneurysm, moyamoya disease, amyloid angio-
pathy), and dysfunctional coagulation (coagulopathy, drugs). 
Drug-induced ICH is mostly attributed to anticoagulants, 
thrombolytics, sympathomimetics, mecamphecamine, or 
cocaine!). Although there are four previous reports about 
ICH after sildenafil use, all of these were manifested as 
minimal volume hemorrhage in elderly with risk factors and 
thus, surgical evacuation was not required1•4•9•10l. The present 
case mimics either diffuse, thick SAH from rupture of the 
proximal MCA aneurysm, or massive ICH leaking into the 
ventricles and subarachnoid space. With the aid of angio-
graphy, possibility of vascular anomaly was discarded. The 
cause and effect relationship of sildenafil and ICH herein,

intention, it is manufactured aiming at the corpus caverno-
sum of the human male. It plays a role in causing muscle 
relaxation, vasodilatation and penile erection by increasing 
concentration of cGMP and nitrous oxide (NO) in the 
smooth muscle of the corpus cavemosum3l. Side effects of 
sildenafil, including flushing, headache, nasal congestion, 
and changes in pulmonary blood flow can tell us that such 
vasodilatory effect is not confined to the corpus cavemo-
sum 11·12l. This drug also redistributes the arterial flow, and 
decreases perfusion, consequently may lead to acute myo-
cardial infarction. For the above reasons, it lowers systolic 
blood pressure by 8 to 10 mmHg in clinical trials14l. 
Several ischemic manifestations, such as transient ische-
mic attack, ischemic stroke, cerebral infarction, or ischemic 
optic neuropathy can be explained by the above mecha-
nisms8l. Vasodilatory effect of sildenafil may also cause atrial 
fibrillation, provoke atrial thrombi and cardioembolism in 
a pre-existing cardiomyopathic patient by increasing pres-
sure gradient over the left ventricular outflow tracr2l. On 
the other hand, hypotension could lead to secondary sym-
pathetic hyperactivity'3·12l. Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, 
and rebound sympathetic hyperactivity seems to play con-
certed roles in producing stroke, especially in ischemic stroke. 
In previous literatures, we could not find any linear relation-
ship between drug dosage (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg) and 
occurrence of stroke1.4,5,7•10l. But, all cases were associated 
with utilizing more than 50 mg once or twice in a short 
period. An unknown process of sensitization may be involv-
ed however, the mode of drug action in large part, may be 
not cumulative but idiosyncratic. 
The reported occurrence of headache, dizziness, visual 
disturbances, retinal dysfunction, and a pupil-sparing oculo-
motor palsy suggest that sildenafil affects regulation of the 
cerebral microvasculature. In addition to a selective action 
on PDE-5, sildenafil may act on other two types of PDE 
(PDE-1 and PDE-2), which are involved in control of cereb-
ral vasculature6•13>. To date, there has been no clear evidence 
to explain pertinent mechanisms of ICH associated with 
sildenafil. 
In summary, sildenafil may act by redistributing arterial 
blood flow, hence rendering brain tissue more inappro-
priate perfusion, presenting as prodromes of headache, ner-
vousness and speech disturbance as shown in the current 
case. Ensuing sympathetic hyperactivity through PDE-1 
and PDE-2 might lead to rupture of vessels. Although it is 
contrary to common belief, we suggest that these inciting 
and propagating factors for ICH even in a young adult 
212 
male patient without known risk factors should be warned 
before prescribing sildenafil. 
CONCLUSION 
Sildenafil is a potentially dangerous drug, which can 
provoke life-threatening ICH and SAH in a young adult 
male. When considering usage, careful discussion and pre-
medication work-up with urologist is mandatory. Adverse 
effect, such as headache, nervousness, dizziness or speech 
disturbance should be promptly diagnosed to minimize 
sequelae.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage associated 
with tadalafil 
Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type-
s (PDES) inhibitor indicated for the 
treatment of erectile dysfunction. in-
hibition of the PDES isoenzyme, which 
is responsible for degradation of cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate in the corpus 
cavernosum, will ultimately enhance the 
effect of nitric oxide and, consequently, 
the relaxation of the vascular smooth 
muscle in the corpus cavernosum and 
penile erection after sexual stimulation. 
Tadalafil is the longest-acting PDES in-
hibitor, with an elimination half-life of 
17.5 hours and up to 36 hours' duration 
of effect. The drug has been associated 
with headache, flushing, dizziness, visual 
disturbances, and hypotension.1 
A 45-year-old previously healthy man 
arrived at the emergency department with 
a severe headache of five hours' duration 
associated with one episode of vomit-
ing. There was no decrease in the level 
of consciousness, no foca l neurologic 
deficit, and no convulsive activity. The 
patient was previously healthy, with no 
history of diabetes meUitus, hyperten-
sion, cerebrovascular disease, trauma, 
or bleeding disorders and denied taking 
any prescription medication, over-the-
counter medicine, or herbal products. 
The patient's family and social histories 
were unremarkable. On examination, he 
was agitated and in severe discomfort 
due to the headache. He reported tak-
ing one 20-mg tablet of tadalafil a few 
hours before the onset of symptoms 
and stated that he had started taking 
tadalafil recently "as needed" without 
consulting a health care provider. A 
computed tomography (CT) scan of his 
head revealed a subarachnoid hemor-
rhage (SAH) (3 x 4 cm in diameter); CT 
angiography of the head showed novas-
cular abnormalities or aneurysmal mal-
fo rmations. An electrocardiogram and 
a chest radiograph were normal, and 
all laboratory test values and vital signs 
were within normal limits. The patient 
had an uneventful fo ur-day stay in the 
intensive care unit; he received 60 mg of 
nimodipine orally very fo ur hours and 
was discharged home. 
This patient's adverse reaction can 
be attributed to tadalafil because of the 
temporal relationship between use of the 
drug and the SAH. The probable associa-
tion of the event with tadalafil use is en-
hanced by the fact that the patient had no 
risk factors for developing an SAH, and 
no underlying etiology was evident. Use 
of the Naranjo et aJ.2 adverse-reaction 
probability scale revealed a probable as-
sociation between the SAH and tadalafil 
(score of 6). In addition, a PubMed search 
about this probable association revealed 
two cases of intracerebral hemorrhage 
(!CH) associated with the use of tadalafil. 
Steeves et al.3 reported a possible associa-

tion between tadalafil use and arteriove-
nous malformation (AVM) hemorrhage 
during coitus in a 59-year-old man. 
The AVM was excised, and the patient 
made an uneventful recovery. Gazzeri et 
al.4 described an !CH in a 70-year-old 
man without evidence of any vascular 
anomalies who took 40 mg of tadalafil 
to enhance his sexual performance one 
hour before the onset of symptoms. The 
patient was discharged from the hospital 
after seven days with improvement in 
neurologic symptoms. Six cases of SAH 
or !CH have been reported after the in-
gestion of si ldenafil,'·10 and a single case 
of !CH was reported in a patient taking 
vardenafil. 11 
Tadalafil can inhibit PDES, which 
is found in platelets. This can lead to 
the inhibition of platelet activation and 
aggregation." On the other hand, ni-
tric oxide induces relaxation of vascu-
lar smooth muscles. Platelet inhibition 
combined with increased cerebral blood 
flow may be associated with an increased 
risk of SAH.9 Although tadalafil has not 
been shown to increase bleeding times in 
healthy patients, the manufacturer rec-
ommends that caution be exercised in 
patients with bleeding disorders or sig-
nificant active peptic ulceration. 1 
Given the potential risk of hemorrhag-
ic stroke after the ingestion of tadalafil, cli-
nicians should be cautious when prescrib-
ing this medication and should consider 
this agent as a potential cause of cerebral 
hemorrhage in patients with no other un-
derlying etiology or risk factors.

A Web-based experiential rotation platform 
Today's college students may require 
different approaches to teaching and 
learning. The so-called "video-game gen-
eration" currently populating the major-
ity of pharmacy schools is adept at using 
technology and seems to respond well to 
interactive teaching techniques.' Efforts 
to increase the use of technology to en-
gage students in learning have been met 
with some success.'"" To date, little has 
been reported outside the classroom set-
ting regarding the use of technology to 
individualize a student's experience or 
the integration of technology into the 
clinical experiences of a pharmacy resi-
dency program.5 
Currently, several colleges of phar-
macy use Web platforms to serve as a hub 
for students and preceptors at rotation 
sites.6 Our institution effectively uses this 
type of system to distribute important 
announcements, view student and pre-
ceptor schedules, and complete evalua-
tions. Recently, we began exploring the 
use of a Web-based platform (Microsoft 
SharePoint, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, 
WA) to organize and shepherd students 
through common advanced pharmacy 
practice experiences (APPEs) at our in-
stitution, as well as coordinate the rota-
tion experiences of pharmacy residents. 
For preceptors, this technology affords 
numerous advantages, which are de-
scribed below. 
Microsoft SharePoint is an integrated 
server program within the Microsoft Of-
fice system.' This platform enables pre-
ceptors to customize a website specific 
to their rotation. Students are provided 
with immediate and ongoing access to 
the overall rotation description, expecta-
tions, and assignments. 
One of the benefits of using this type 
of technology for experiential education 
is its customizability. Preceptors are free 
to upload documents, design student-
controlled pages (e.g., biogs), and de-
velop calendars. Users are granted per-
mission to view, modify, and control 
content by the preceptor. We have cho-
sen an approach that wiU allow each 
rotation site to have a similar structure 
while maintaining preceptors' autonomy 
regarding content. This should provide 
some fam iliarity for students who have 
several APPEs. In addition, a core group 
of preceptors can facilitate a site tem-
plate and design for those preceptors less 
comfortable with the process. Residents 
also frequently engage in these rotation 
experiences and can have materials and 
resources specific to their level of exper-
tise and rotation objectives layered into 
each rotation site. 
At its most basic level, the rotation 
website can be used to house the basic 
information a student or resident may 
need for the rotation experience. Links 
to the current syllabus, contact informa-
tion, and a rotation calendar are com-
mon components of our rotation web-
sites. Learning modules can add another 
layer of content to the website. Another 
approach to developing content for these 
Web pages may be to have each student 
or resident create a concise summary on 
a topic. This succinct, one- or two-page 
primer on a specific topic could serve as 
the initial content for each module. In 
combination with a library of represen-
tative readings and online resources, each 
module page can be a complete mixed 
media resource that students and resi-
dents can access at any point during the 
rotation experience. 
SharePoint also enables the construc-
tion of "wiki" and blog pages. This func-
tion would permit students to keep a 
journal of their experiences for the month 
(e.g., unique patient cases encountered, 
drug information pearls learned, key con-
cepts or queries that required time and ef-
fort to research). In addition, because the 
entire website is searchable, each topic re-
corded on the journal page is then part of 
the content on the site and viewable from 
the primary content pages. 
As with any new educational tool, the 
effectiveness of this Web-based module 
wiU need to be assessed. We believe that 
two global areas should be addressed 
in the assessment of this type of educa-

ABSTRACT 
Sildenafil is a drug used in the treatment of male impotence. Few cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage following the use of sildenafil 
have been cited in the literature. A 42-year-old man was admitted to the emergency outpatient clinic of Istanbul Educational and Research 
Hospital after sudden loss of con sciousness. He had ingested alcohol, taken 50mg sildenafil and had sexual intercourse. Non-contrast cranial 
tomography revealed an intracerebral hematoma with extension to the ventricles. 
Sildenafil Is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor. With the inhibition of PDE-5, the amount of cyclic-guanosine monophosphate 
(c-GMP) in the smooth vascular muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum increases, leading to a relaxation of muscles and vasodilatation. Studies 
have shown that the NO-c-GMP pathway leads to cerebral vasodilatatlon with a similar mechanism. The literature has shown that the effect of 
PDE-1 and PDE-2 on cerebral bleeding control is affected by sildenafil. This increased blood flow increases the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. 
Although data concerning the presentation of intracerebral hematoma in connection with the combined use of alcohol ingestion and use of 
sildenafil is inadequate, it can nevertheless be thought that the combined use increases the risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and 
caution is in order concerning the matter.

INTRODUCTION 
Sildenafil is a drug used in the treatment of male impotence. 
It has a direct effect on the vessels of the corpus cavernosum. 
Sildenafil acts on the corpus cavernosum by way of a raised 
concentration of c-GMP and NO in the smooth muscle cells. 
The increased c-GMP concentration leads to vasodilatation 
and the erection of the penis (7). In addition to this vascular 
reaction, other well-known side effects are flushing, headache 
and dizziness due to dilatation of the cerebral veins (10). 
Among its adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke has not been 
widely reported yet (7). Although few cases of spontaneous 
intracranial hemorrhage following the use of sildenafil have 
been reported in the literature. We report a case of fatal

subarachnoid and intracerebral haemorrhage as a result of 
ingestion of alcohol and non-prescription use of sildenafil. 
CASE REPORT 
A 42-year-old man was admitted to the emergency outpatient 
clinic of istanbul Educational and Research Hospital after 
sudden loss of consciousness. He was said to have ingested 
alcohol, taken SO mg sildenafil and had sexual intercourse. 
On admission, blood pressure was 210/ 130 mm Hg and pulse 
88 per minute. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5 (no eye 
opening, no verbal response and flexion to pain). Non-contrast 
cranial tomography revealed an anterior interhemispheric 
bleeding with extension to all four ventricles (Figure 1, 2). An

angiography would have preferably been performed but the 
patient's condition did not allow this. No other tests related 
to an increased risk of stroke could be performed. An external 
ventricular drain was placed and the patient was taken to 
the intensive care unit but he failed to respond to maximal 
therapy and died. 
DISCUSSION 
The reasons of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage can 
be categorised as hypertension, non-hypertensive gross 
structural vascular anomalies (AVM, aneurysm, MoyaMoya 
disease, amyloid angiopathy, etc.), intracranial neoplasms, 
cerebral venous thrombosis, infection and dysfunctional 
coagulopathy. Drug-induced intracerebral haemorrhages are 
related to anticoagulant thrombolytics, sympathomimetics, 
methamphetamines or cocaine (1, 7). Cases of intracerebral 
hemorrhages in relation to sildenafil use are being increasingly 
reported recently (1, 3 ,4,7, 11 ). 
Sildenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-S (PDE-5) enzyme 
inhibitor. With the inhibition of PDE-S, the amount of cyclic-
guanosine monophosphatase (cGMP) in the vascular smooth 
muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum increases, leading 
to a relaxation of muscles and vasodilatation (1 ). Studies 
have shown that the NO-c-GMP pathway leads to cerebral 
vasodilatation with a similar mechanism (1 , 4). Alpsan et al. 
has shown that the effect of PDE-1 and PDE-2 on cerebral 
bleeding is affected by sildenafil. This increase in blood flow 
may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (1 ). 
486 
Figure 2: Non-contrast cranial tomography revealed an anterior 
interhemispheric bleeding with extension to all four ventricles 
(fourth ventricle). 
The side effects of sildenafil are well known. There are side 
effects related to vascular structures such as headache, 
flushing, diuiness and nasal congestion (10). 
Another result of the non-prescription use of the drug is 
usage in improper dose. The recommended starting dose of 
sildenafil should be 50 mg and the maximum dose within 24 
hours should be 100 mg (10, 11). 
Sildenafil is the best selling drug in the global market for the 
treatment of male impotence (7). In addition to the use of 
prescription sildenafil, the non-prescription use of the drug 
is significantly high due to the ease in access to the drug 
without a prescription. 
In this study; an intracerebral hemorrhage case due to 
the ingestion of alcohol with sildenafil where surgical 
treatment was not possible is presented. Although there 
are cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral 
hemorrhage caused by the use of sildenafil, there are few 
cases in the literature reporting intracerebral or subarachnoid 
hemorrhage associated with the use of sildenafil (1 , 7, 8, 11 , 
10). 
Sildenafil is not reported to interact with ASA, antiacids and 
alcohol (6). It is difficult to understand the effects of alcohol 
ingestion in cases of intracranial hemorrhage caused by the 
combined ingestion of sildenafil with alcohol. There are reports 
in literature that point to a possible relationship between 
the ingestion of alcohol and spontaneous intracerebral

hemorrhage (2, 6, 9). There is no data suggesting an increase 
in the risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage due to 
combined ingestion of alcohol and sildenatil. However, our 
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage case after ingestion 
of alcohol and sildenatil indicates that this could be a harmful 
combination. 
CONCLUSION 
Although there is inadequate data to connect intracerebral 
hemorrhage to the combined use of alcohol ingestion and 
non-prescription use of sildenatil, caution should be exercised 
about drinking alcoholic beverages when using sildenatil 
as this may increase the risk of spontaneous intracerebral 
hemorrhage.

lntracranial aneurysm and sildenafil

Sildenafil is one of the most GOmmonly used drugs for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction. To date, we found five reported cases of intracerebral 
bleeding and two reported cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage related to 
sildenafil use. We report a 49-year-old hypertensive and diabetic patient 
who presented with acute pulmonary edema and loss of consciousness 
following ingestion of 100 mg of sildenafil prior to sexual intercourse. 
He was not previously aware of the presence of an aneurysm and had 
no family history of it. Computed tomography of his head revealed a 
subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm with 
subsequent repeat hemorrhage within a few hours of presentation. A 
sudden increase in blood pressure led to pulmonary edema. Studies have 
shown that sildenafil acts on phosphodiesterase-1, -2 and -5 receptors 
and leads to a secondary increase in intracerebral circulation and vaso-
dilatory effects, leading to sympathetic overactivity which increases the 
risk for intracranial bleeding. 
S 
ildenafil, marketed as Viagra, is a widely used phospho-
diesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitor to treat male sexual/erectile 
dysfunction and to increase libido and sexual perfor-
mance. The common adverse effects ofthis drug include 
headache, flushing, indigestion, and impaired vision. Five cases 
ofintracerebral bleeding and two cases of subarachnoid hemor-
rhage (SAH) due to sildenafil use have been reported (1-7). We 
report a 49-year-old man who presented with a hypertensive 
crisis and an SAR caused by rup.ture of a saccular intracranial 
aneurysm during sexual intercourse following sildenafil intake. 
CASE REPORT 
A 49-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and hypertension 
was brought in to the emergency department due to acute-onset 
shortness of breath and loss of consciousness during sexual inter-
course. The patient had ingested 1 oa mg of sildenafil prior to the 
event (unknown time gap). Reportedly, he was diaphoretic and 
short of breath and required intubation due to a low Glasgow 
Coma$cale score of <7. His blood pressure was 181/105 mm 
Hg with a mean arterial pressure of 124 mm Hg. His chest 
examination revealed bibasilar crackles. A neurological examina-
tion was not completed because the patient was sedated. His pu-
pils were.round and reactive with normal deep tendon reflexes, 
and he coulcj. localize the pain. Routine blood counts, platelet 
178 
counts, ,and coagulation factors were normal. His chest x-ray 
revealed diffuse bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary 
edema. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm. 
An arterial blood gas showed high anion gap (29) metabolic 
,acidosis with respiratory acidosis: pH 7 .22; partial pressure of 
oxygen, 68 mm Hg; par_tial pressure of carbon dioxidi:, 42.7 
mm Hg; bicarbonate, 17.1 mEq/L; and lactate, 4.7 mmol/L. 
Bedside t:ransthoracic echocardiography showed normal systolic 
function with no regional wall motion abnormality and grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. 
Computed tomography of the head showed a massive acute 
SAH with the largest blood collection in the area of the anterior 
communicating artery with mild hydrocephalus (Figure la). 
The patient was started on :mannitol 100 g over 30 minutes 
and underwent computed tomography angiogram of intracra-
nial vessels, which showed an aneurysm at the junction of the 
right anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating ar-
tery (Figure lb). He was urgently taken to the operating room 
and underWent ventriculostomy. While in the operating room, 
his ventricular pressures increased, his pupils dilated, ~uggest-
ing brain herniation, and he underwent bilateral decompres-
sive craniotomy and aneurysm clipping. Postoperatively, his 
Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3/f5, and he was· coolecj. to 
maintain temperature around 35°C for 48 hours. Because of 
his low Glasgow Coma Scale score, his chances for safe extu-
bation seemed unlikely, and a tracheostomy and percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy tube were placed on postoperative day 
8. On postoperative day 10, he started to improve slowly, and 
his Glasgow Coma Scale increased to 15/15 on postoperative 
day 31. He continued to require a tracheostomy collar and was 
discharged to a neurorehabilitation instituti:.

cerebrovascular smooth muscles is affected by nitric oxide and 
PDE. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase in the cerebral 
arterial cells. The activated guanylate cyclase converts guanosine 
triphosphate to cGMP. The latter causes relaxation of vascular 
smooth muscle cells in the cerebral vasculacure (9, 10). 
The relationship between intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) 
and sildenafil use is likely due to increased blood flow to the 
intracranial vessels, which is significantly increased during sexual 
intercourse. Increased blood flow to the cerebral blood vessels 
facilitates rupture of the cerebrovascular vessels in patients with 
other hemorrhagic risk factors (3). Ballard et al suggested that 
sildenafil also acts on PDE-1 and PDE-2, which are involved 
in controlling cerebral circulation (11). Studies on mice have 
demonstrated that sildenafil decreases cerebral vasospasm by 
increasing and restoring cGMP levels (12). The reported ad-
verse effects of sildenafil include headache, visual disturbances, 
pupil-sparing third nerve palsy, and transient hypertension, and 
these symptoms suggest that sildenafil also affects brain micro-
vasculature regulation (13, 14). Unusual susceptibility to this 
drug could lead to abnormal vasodilatation of cerebral arteries 
and abnormal redistribution of arterial blood flow in the brain. 
The hypothetical relationship between ICH and sildenafil 
ingestion is not well understood (2, 5). Transcranial Doppler 
studies have shown that sildenafil increases cerebrovascular re-
activity and causes vasodilation with increased blood flow and 
volume (15). The vasodilatory effect of sildenafil causes hypo-
tension that could lead to an increase in sympathetic activity, 
which might be the reason for secondary hypertension leading 
to SAH, as occurred in our case. Ayberk et al reported a case of 
intracerebral bleed in a healthy 35-year-old man 3 hours after 
ingestion of 50 mg of sildenafil without any sexual activity (5) . 
This supports our conclusion that sildenafil results in reactive 
sympathetic hyperactivity that leads to ICH regardless of the 
presence or absence of other risk factors, such as hypertension 
and sexual intercourse. Nevertheless, our known hypertensive 
patient had an elevated blood pressure and SAH after sildenafil 
use. Whether the hypertensive crisis in this patient caused by 
sildenafil was secondary to sympathetic hyperactivity or sexual 
intercourse or whether the ICH itself caused hypertension can-
not be determined. Also, we do not know if there is a dose-
related effect which causes ICH. All reported patients ingested 
50 mg or more (Table 1). 
Sildenafil citrate has been shown to be safe in patients without 
cardiovascular disease but is contraindicated in those with acute 
coronary syndromes, life-threatening coronary arrhythmias, and 
recent stroke. The US Food and Drug Administration advises

cautioned use of sildenafil in patients with a history of myo-
cardial infarction or stroke within 6 months and those with 
resting hypotension, severe hypertension (<170/110 mm Hg), 
and heart failure (16). 
All five previously reported intracerebral hemorrhages with 
sildenafil use presented with minimal volume hemorrhage in 
elderly patients with a risk factor ofICH, and surgical evacuation 
was not required (Table I) (l-5). However, the previous two re-
ports ofSAH with sildenafil use were associated with severe bleed-
ing (6, 7). One patient required emergency decompression due 
to impending herniation, and the other patient was pronounced 
dead on arrival (6, 7). Our patient rebled following the initial 
SAH and underwent ventriculostomy and bilateral decompres-
sive cranioromy. His neurological status improved tremendously, 
and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15/15 on discharge. In 
conclusion, sildenafil is a relatively safe and widely used medica-
tion to treat erectile dysfunction. However, serious complications, 
such as severe ICH and SAH, have been reported with its use.

A 28-year-old healthy man was admitted to our hospital because of right-sided 
headache, vomiting, and lower back pain after the administration of vardenafil. 
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a 
small, right-sided, subdural hematoma. A lumbar magnetic resonance 
imaging showed a longitudinalJy extended subdural hematoma. He had no 
history of trauma. We specu.lated that vardenafil might have had an association 
with the bleeding. Several reports have suggested a relationship between 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Our case suggested that there may also be risks of bleeding into the subdural 
space. Although headache and nausea are common side effects of vardenafil, 
hemorrhagic diseases should also be considered when symptoms are severe or 
prolonged. Key Words: Subdural hematoma-vardenafil- pho phodie terase-5

Introduction 
Phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, 
are widely used for the treatment of erectile dysfunc-
tion. Headache and vomiting are common side effects of 
PDE-5 inhibitors. Recently, cases of intracerebral and sub-
arachnoid hemorrhages possibly representing the risks and 
severe adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors have been 
reported.1-< We report the case of a healthy young man

sided headache with vomiting occurring 2 hours after 
taking 10 mg of vardenafil. He also noticed lower back 
pain after the headache onset. He had no history of trauma 
and his only cardiovascular risk was a 7-year smoking 
history. He reported having ingested vardenafil solely out 
of curiosity and denied sexual intercourse. His neuro-
logical exa mination result was nonfocal. Laboratory 
findings, including platelet count and coagulation panels, 
were normal. Computed tomography and magnetic res-
onance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a small, right-
sided, subdural hematoma (Fig 1, A,B). Magnetic resonance 
angiography and venography showed no vascular lesions.

improved with conservative management, and all symp-
toms had completely disappeared 10 days after onset. 
Repeat computed tomography and MRI scans showed 
decreased intracranial and spinal hematoma sizes (Fig 1, 
E-H). 
Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the first case of subd ural 
hemorrhage associated with PDE-5 inhibitors. Concom-
itant intracranfal and spinal ASDH are also rare 
phenomena.• A previous study reported a 3% incidence 
rate for intracranial, nontraumatic ASDH,6 with risk 
factors including hypertension, vascular abnormalities 
such as aneurysm, and anticoagulation therapy.' In con-
trast, similar to other reported cases, our patient had 
almost no risk factors.24 Although the underlying mech-
anism remains unknown, the vasodilatory and antiplatelet 
effects of PDE-5 inhibitors8·9 may be associated with the 
ASDH in our patient. Further evidence of the relation-
ship between va.rdena.fil and bleeding in our patient is 
based on the time from drug ingestion to headache 
onset, which corresponds to the time to maximum 
concentration of vardenafil.10 PDE-5 inhibitors may be 
associated with intracranial and spinal hematoma risks. 
When headache, vomiting, and lower back pa.in appear 
after the administration of PDE-5 inhibitors, the possi-
bility of hemorrhagic diseases must be considered.

Astract 
lntracerebral hemorrhage 
occurs when a diseased blood 
vessel within the brain bursts. 
We present a case of 69-year-
old patient with two sequential 
episodes of lobar intracerebral 
hemorrhage occurring during 
sexual intercourse. Both 
episodes were associated with 
the use of phosphodiesterase-5 
inhibitors. This is the first case 
reported which is temporally 
associated with isolated bilateral 
lobar bleeds with appropriate 
use of phosphodiesterase-5 
inhibitor on two different 
occasions associated with sexual 
intercourse. 
Introduction 
lntracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) (code 43 1, International 
Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Revision) is a neurological 
deficit documented by brain CT 
or MRI showing the presence 
of an intracranial bleed in the 
parenchyma of the brain. ' ICI-I is a 
serious cerebrovascular condition 
associated with high mortality and 
morbidi ty in adults. Etiological 
factors fo r spo ntaneous ICH include 
vasculopathies, such as, cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy, hypertension, 
aneurysms, vascular malfo rmations;

APPENDIX -28 
Case Report: History and Clinical Findings 
The patient was a 69-year-olcl white male who 
experienced two episodes of intracranial lobar 
hemorrhage temporally associated with PDE-5 use. He 
had previous history of intracerebral hemorrhage nine 
months prior to presentation, coronary artery disease, 
colon cancer status post two resections, and subsequent 
chemo and radiation therapy, erectile dysfunction 
and hyperlipiclemia. He presented to the emergency 
department with complaints of one-clay history of 
headache, confusion, and inability to concentrate. The 
headache was bifrontal in location without radiation, 5/ 10 
in intensity and squeezing in character. There was no 
associated photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, congestion 
or lacrimation. There was no slurring of speech, hearing 
loss, neck stiffness or significant weakness. The patient 
has been normotensive and non-diabeti c throughout his 
life. He was on multi-vitamin, 8 1 mg aspirin, silclenafi l 
(25 mg) for his erectile dysfunction, and tamsulosin for 
benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
He had strong family history of coronary artery 
disease and myocardial infarction. He had a daughter with 
brain aneurysm which was treated surgically. He did not 
smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. His labs were within 
normal range without abnormal platelet count or I R. 
On examination, he was well nourished and in no 
acute distress. The remainder of the general examination 
was unremarkable. On mental status exam he scored 
12/ 30 on ,vtMSE with deficits in all spheres except 
repetition and orientation to place. His executive 
functions were compromised with difficulty calculating 
and was also not able to follow three step commands. He 
was not able to repeat three objects consecutively and 
follow written commands. In addition, he had verbal and 
action perseveration. The remainder of the cranial nerve 
exam was unremarkable. 
Motor exam was unremarkable. Deep tendon 
reflexes were symmetric. Sensation to all modalities was 
intact. He had no ataxia. Cortical sensations including 
graphesthesia and stereognosis were normal. 
On funcloscopic c,,am, the patient had 
bilateral papilleclema. The patient was hypertensive 
( I 60/90mmHg) and required intravenous (IV) hyclralazine 
for control of blood pressure. While in the emergency 
department his headache resolved a few hours after 
presentation. He was started in emergency department on 
phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis after ICJ-1. 
SCIENCE OF MEDICINE I FIRST LITERATURE REPORT 
on-contrast computed tomography (Cl) of brain 
showed acute left frontal lobe bleed and chronic right 
frontal encephalomalacia from prior ICH (Figure 1). 
About nine months prior to current presentation, he had 
presented with a similar syndrome and brain CT at that 
time showed large right frontal bleed (Figure 2-the 
remnant of this bleed is the source of chronic changes 
in Figure 1). Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
exam showed a left frontal intracerebral hemorrhage 
with both a subacute and acute component with minimal 
mass effect on left lateral ventricle and no miclline shift. 
The MRI was also notable for evidence of previous right 
frontal hemorrhage, mostly resolved, with resultant 
encephalomalacia. Periventricular T2 hyperintense signals 
were present in the frontal areas suggesting chronic small 
vessel disease (SVD) (see Figure 3 current bleed, Figure 
4 for prior right bleed). Carotid duplex ultrasound 
demonstrated mild carotid plac1ues bilaterally without 
any significant stenosis. MRA angiogram of head and 
neck were negative for any aneurysm, arteriovcnous 
malformations or other vascular anomalies. 
On further discussion with the patient's wife on the 
second clay of the admission, she noted that the patient's 
headache began while they were in engaged in sexual 
intercourse. She also noted they had been engaged in 
intercourse leading up to the previous episode of ICH 
approximately nine months prior when the patient had 
the initial right sided frontal intralobar hemorrhage 
(Figure 4) . She noted the prior headache occurred during 
intercourse while using tadalafil fo r erectile dysfun ction. 
She also noted he had taken silclenafi l (25mg) and was 
engaged in intercourse just prior to development of the 
headache which led to the current presentation, and 
discovery of the new left intra lobar frontal hemorrhage 
(l' igure 3). 
The temporal relationship of the two occurrences of 
ICJ-1 on two different occasions with the use of the PDE-5 
inhibitors was concerning for possible causality. It seems 
likely that type PDE-5 inhibitor use and sexual activity 
in the setting of underlying vascular pathology, possibly 
amyloicl angiopathy, contributed to the bleeds. He had 
used PDE-5 inhibitors several other times in the past, 
but not with a great deal of frequency. The wife could 
not give a detailed history of this and the patient wasn't 
aware at that point and time hm often he had used them. 
He never reported a sexual headache prior to his first 
presentation of ICH. He was counseled to stop taking any

he was not achised to discontinue use of PD E-5 inhibitors 
after his first episode of intracerebral hemorrhage. 
The patient did well initially with conscn ·ati\·c 
111anage111ent after both bleeds. His phenytoin was 
disco ntinued al discharge. Approximately eighteen 
mo nths aflt' r the second bleed, he de1·cloped partial 
complex epilepsy and was treated with lnetiracctarn 
which he tolerated very well. He had to give up hi. real 
estate business due to his executi,·e dysfuncti o n resulting 
from the bilateral bleeds. 
Discussion 
The 01·erall incidence of intracerebral he111orrhage 
(!CH) is 12 to I 5 cases per I 00,000 individuals o r about 
40,000 cases per )"ear in the United States. Spontaneous 
(atraun1atic) primary !C H is a catastrophic for111 of 
stro ke associated with high 111orbidity and 111ortali ty 
402 I 116:5 I September/October 2019 I Missouri Medicine 
and a substantial recurrence risk. Lobar IC H locatio n is 
associated with the risk of subsec1uent ICH recurrence, 
likely because of the type and se,·erity of the underlying 
small ,·essel diseases (n1i croangiopathies), 1d1ich include 
arteriolosd crosis, lipohya linosis, and cerebral a111yloid 
angiopathy (CAI\)." 
lntracerebral hemorrhage 111o rtalit-y is about 40% al 
30 days, si111ilar to AH in acute 111o rtality ' The fi,-c-
year 111ortality rate is 01-cr 50% (52% for 111ab, 56% fo r 
fe111 ales) in !CH patients older than 45 years, and the 
I 0-Year sun·i,·al rate is 24. I %. 1·11 f o r those who sun-iYc 
a spo ntaneous ICH, the risk of recurrence is in the 2% 
range, annually. 1 Since our patient was norn1otensive 
and non-diabetic, it is highly suspicious that arnyloid 
deposition might have played a significa nt role in altering 
the Ill icrostructure of the cerebral w ssels. 
Fourteen cases of adult intracrania l he111orrhage 
associated with the use of PDE-5 were found o n re,·icw of 
the English language literature. The case reports' subjects 
range fro 111 33 years old to 70 years old. All developed 
cerebral hemorrhage symptoms (including heada ·he, 
dizziness, blurry visio n, decreased 111entation, and nausea) 
30 minutes to three hours after ingestio n of PDE-5 
inhibitor. 
one of these subjects had history of !CH. 
One report noted the patient described ll'as fo und to 
ha,·e an arterial 1-c nous n,alfo rmation, 1d1ich was thought 
to be the causes of the hemorrhage'". None of the other 
cases reported known vascu lar malfor111ations. Bleed 
locati on varied fro m cortical to subconical without ,1 ny 
appreciable correlation to age of subjects. Dosage ,·aried

The relatio nship between !CH and PD E-5 inhibitors 
is likely due to increased blood llow to the intracranial 
,·essl'ls during sexual intercourse which is further 
enhanced by concurrent use of these drugs. Sexual 
intercourse is knoll'n to produce a hyper dynamic 
circulato ry state in both men and ll'Olllen, mani fested 
by in creased hea rt rate and blood pressure. 7·' 5 fo llowing 
sexual stimu latio n, penile erection occurs through the 
release of nitric oxide ( 0 ), which causes dilatio n 
of the blood 1·cssds of the corpus ca1·ernosu111 l"ia an 
accumulation of cyclic guanosine 111o nophosphate 
(cG MP). The PDE-5 inhibito rs enhance this ,·asodilatory 
effect of NO-cGJ\ IP pathway by inhibiting PD E-5, the 
enzyme responsible for brcakdoll'n of cGMP. "tudies ha,-c

also shown that sildenafil acts on phosphodiesterase- I, 
-2 and -5 receptors and leads to a secondary increase in 
intracerebral circulation and vasodilatory effects, leading 
to sympathetic over activity which increases the risk 
for intracranial bleeding. 25•26 Side effects of sildenafi l, 
including flushing, headache, nasal congestion, and 
changes in pulmonary blood flow indicate the multisystem 
vasodilation caused by these drugs."·" 
Our case appears to be first one high lighting the 
temporal relationship between usage of two separate 
PDE-5 inhibitors and two separate episodes of !CH 
in different areas of the brain in one patient. This case 
bolsters existing evidence that PDE-5 inhibitors as a class 
should be viewed with caution. As of publication, I' DA 
warns against possible card iovascular adverse reactions, 
hearing loss, hypotension, and priapism, however does 
not warn that !CH may be possible side effect. 
Conclusion 
This case of recurrent lobar hemorrhages revolves 
around use of PDE-5 inhibitors and !CH likely associated 
with preexisting microvasculature pathology, precipitating 
ICH. It illustrates the risk of intracranial hemorrhage 
associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors during 
sexu al intercourse. It would appear to be a particularly 
cautionary tale in the instance of prior intracranial bleed, 
or in the setting of known cerebrovascular disease. It is of 
utmost importance to discuss the risks and benefits before 
prescribing such medi cations to patients with possible 
underlying vasculopathies ancVor prior bleed. If it is 
desirable to use these mediations, it is likely prudent to 
start at the lowest possible dose in these populations.
