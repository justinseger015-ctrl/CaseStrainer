Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
The Petitioner was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the 
First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a Controlled 
' 
Substance (Heroin), and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. See 
State v. Justin C. Lewis, 35775-9-111, 2019 WL 1568058 (Div. Ill, Apr. 
11, 2019)(Unpublished)(affached hereto).1 The underlying facts of 
the case are largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. 
Those facts pertinentto the issues raised, which th is Court specifically 
requested that the State address, are recited herein. 
The Petitioner was represented by attorney Robert Van ldour 
throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order (04/05/17) 
(attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour was, and is still currently, a licensed 
member of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and 
was assigned, at that time, to provide public defense, on contract 
under APR B(c). Declaration of Robert J. Van ldour (attached hereto). 
Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had 
arranged to practice under APR 8(c), which authorizes attorneys who 
are licensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public 
defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in 
Washington. Declaration ofRobertJ. Van ldour, Declaration ofVivian 
Bly. (attached hereto). Prior to contracting with Mr. Van ldour, the 
1The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but 
rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

--- Page 6 ---
Board of County Commissioners inquired of the Superior Court 
Judge, Scott Gallina, regarding Mr. Van ldour's qualifications to 
contract for public defense without being licensed in Washington. 
Declaration of Vivian Bly. Judge Gallina confirmed that Mr. Van I dour 
would be eligible through APR 8(c) process to perform duties under 
a contract while he applied for admission to the Washington State 
Bar. Throughout the process, the SuperiorCourtAdministratormade 
periodic efforts to contact the Washington State Bar Association to 
confirm that Mr. Van ldour's application was pending and processing. 
Declaration ofTammyTenny.(attached hereto). On October 26, 2017, 
the Court was notified via email that Mr. Van ldour's application for 
admission had been approved. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. 
In October of 2017, Mr. Van ldour indicated he needed a 
formal order from the Court which was provided, memorializing his 
acceptance by the Court as indigent defense counsel dated October 
6, 2017, nunc pro tune to February 1, 2017. Declaration of Tammy 
Tenny. 
Not until January 31, 2018, did the Court receive any 
information that there was any problem with Mr. Van ldour's 
application to practice under APR B(c).2 The Court immediately 
instructed Mr. Van ldour to arrange to transfer his cases to other 
2 For what it's worth, the Asotin County Prosecutor's office did not 
become aware of any irregularities concerning Mr. Van ldour's eligibility to 
represent indigent defendants until the Court assigned new counsel to Mr. Van 
ldour's cases in February of 2018.

attorneys. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Subsequently, the Court 
received a letter dated February 13, 2018, indicating Mr. Van ldour 
was not authorized to practice in Washington courts. Declaration of 
Tammy Tenny. 
The Petitioner, who was convicted on October 31, 2017 and 
sentenced on November 7, 2017, appealed his conviction, and it was 
affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, 
supra. 
The Petitioner then filed this personal restraint petition, 
alleging only that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying 
solely on the fact that Mr. Van !dour was not licensed to practice in 
Washington. The Defendant does not argue, nor does he make any 
showing that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or 
nonfeasance, nor does he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
RAP 16. 11 (b) authorizes dismissal of the petition if the petition 
is clearly without merit. The Respondent submits that the issues 
raised by the Petitioner are without merit and lack any basis in fact or 
in the law. 
A PRP is not a substitute for a direct appeal. In re Pers. 
Restraint of Hagler, 97 Wn.2d 818, 824, 650 P.2d 1103 (1982). 
Courts are reluctant to overturn a settled judicial decision where the 
Petitioner has had an opportunity for direct appellate review. In re 
Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180Wn.2d 664,676,327 P. 3d 660 (2014). 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
4 

--- Page 8 ---
Therefore, there are limitations on the use of a PRP to collaterally 
attack a conviction. Hagler, 97 Wn.2d at 824. A personal restraint 
petition must state with particularity the factual allegations which, if 
proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. In re Pers. Restraint of 
Rice, 118 Wn.2d 876,886,828 P.2d 1086 (1992). Factual allegations 
must be supported by evidence. 118 Wn.2d at 886. If the record does 
not support the factual allegations, then the petitioner must show 
through affidavits or other forms of corroboration that competent and 
admissible evidence will establish the factual allegations. 118 Wn.2d 
at 886. Bald assertions and conclusory allegations are not sufficient. 
Id. 
To be entitled to collateral relief through a PRP the Petitioner 
must prove the existence of error by a preponderance of the 
evidence. In re Pers. Restraint of Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479,490, 
251 P. 3d 884 (Div. II, 2010). Assuming error can be shown, he is 
also required to prove prejudice. Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 676. The 
significance of the level of prejudice depends on the type of error 
shown. Id. To be entitled to relief for a constitutional error, a 
petitioner must also prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
the error caused "actual and substantial prejudice." Id. (Emphasis 
added). This prejudice "must be determined in light of the totality of 
circumstances," and exists only if the error "so infected petitioner' s 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT

entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process." In re 
Pers. Restraint of Music, 104 Wn.2d 189, 191, 704 P.2d 144 (1985). 
To be entitled to relief for a nonconstitutional error, a petitioner 
must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused 
"a fundamental defect resulting in a complete miscarriage of 
justice." In re Pers. Restraint of Elmore, 162 Wn.2d 236,251, 172 
P.3d 335 (2007) (emphasis added). With this as the backdrop, the 
State will respond to the issue raised. 
A. 
DESPITE IRREGULARITIES WITH REGARD TO TRIAL 
COUNSEL'S LICENSURE. THE PETITIONER WAS NOT 
DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL WHERE TRIAL 
COUNSEL WAS A LICENSED ATTORNEY IN GOOD 
STANDING WITH THE IDAHO STATE BAR. 
The Petitioner bases his entire claim on the fact that his trial 
counsel, Robert Van ldour, was not licensed in Washington State. It 
is beyond dispute that Mr. Van ldour was not licenced with the 
Washington State Bar. It is, however, important to note that much of 
the information now contained in the Bar Association's complaint 
against Mr. Van ldourwas unknown to either Asotin County or the trial 
court. On advice from the Superior Court Judge, the County entered 
into a contract with Mr. Van ldour, who had decades of experience 
representing criminal defendants. The picture painted by the 
Petitioner of a system which was cavalier with regard to the 
Petitioner's right to counsel is not accurate. The Petitioner was 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
6 

--- Page 10 ---
represented by a veteran and capable attorney throughout the 
process, despite the subsequent revelations regarding counsel's 
failure to obtain licensure. 
There can be no question that a criminal defendant has the 
right to effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 
of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint 
of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 672, 101 P.3d 1 (2004). 
Where a 
defendant is denied counsel because the "attorney" was not licensed 
in any state, prejudice may be presumed. See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 
F.Supp. 472,474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), atrd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). 
However, this per se rule does not apply where the attorney is 
licensed to practice but merely lacks a license in the jurisdiction where 
the case occurs. Id. The Petitioner's reliance on Solina is misplaced. 
As explained in Ferrara: 
In support of his position, petitioner looks to the holding of 
Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir.1983), where the 
court found that a per se violation of the right to counsel had 
occurred where the defendant's counsel had repeatedly failed 
the New York bar examination and was not a member of any 
bar. Here, however, {trial counsel] had been a member of the 
New Jersey bar for more than 30 years and was well 
familiarized with general criminal procedure because of his 
years spent as a county prosecutor. 
Ferrara, at 474. Here, Mr. Van ldour was licensed (for more than 30 
years) in Idaho, having handled hundreds of criminal defense cases. 
BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 
7 

--- Page 11 ---
Even assuming that his qualifications under APR 8(c} were lacking, 
he was an attorney licensed to practice. As a result, there was no per 
se deprivation of counsel because Mr. Van ldour was licensed to 
practice in Idaho, and the Petitioner must therefore make a further 
showing under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 
2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). 
To establish that the right to effective assistance of counsel 
has been violated, the Petitioner must make two showings: that 
counsel's representation was deficient and that counsel's deficient 
representation caused prejudice. Ferrara, at 474 (citing Strickland v. 
Washington, 466 U.S. at 687). The Petitioner makes no showing that 
Mr. Van ldour was ineffective or that but for any deficient 
performance, the outcome would have been different. First, the 
Petitioner points to no action or inaction on the part of Mr. Van ldour 
that would constitute deficient performance. Further, the Petitioner, 
as evidenced by his failure to aver otherwise, cannot point to any 
scintilla of prejudice suffered as a result of any act or omission on the 
part of Mr. Van ldour. The Petitioner's sole claim rests on the lack of 
a license to practice law in Washington. Because Mr. Van ldour was 
an attorney and licensed by another state, the Petitioner's per se 
claim of deprivation of the right to an attorney fails. He further fails to 
demonstrate His claim therefore necessarily fails.

V. CONCLUSION 
In summary, the petition filed in this matter, based upon the 
record, is without merit. In the best interests of justice this petition 
shou Id be dismissed. The Respondent respectfully requests that this 
Court enter an order dismissing Petitioner's Personal Restraint 
Petition pursuant to RAP 16.11(b).

SIDDOWAY, J. -Justin Lewis challenges the sufficiency of evidence to support 
his conviction for first degree assault. It is undisputed that Mr. Lewis was present when 
his cousin, David Rickman, struck Michael Evans with a table leg repurposed to serve as 
a bludgeon. Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence demonstrated 
that Mr. Lewis participated in the assault as an accomplice. 
Because the evidence was sufficient and Mr. Lewis raises no viable challenge in a 
statement of additional grounds, we affirm the conviction. We grant Mr. Lewis's motion 
challenging the trial court's imposition of criminal filing and DNA 1 collection fees, and 
remand with directions to strike them.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
On an evening in the spring of 2017, a female acquaintance of Michael Evans 
expressed interest in buying hydrocodone he had offered to obtain. She said she would 
send her friend, Justin Lewis, to pick up Mr. Evans at the Albertson's store in Clarkston. 
Mr. Lewis arrived at the grocery store as arranged, and Mr. Evans told him that 
they needed to go to an apartment complex in Lewiston Orchards, where he would pick 
up the drugs. Mr. Lewis said he needed to stop at his place quickly first. He drove to his 
apartment and went inside while Mr. Evans waited in the truck. 
While Mr. Evans waited, a man he did not know but who turned out to be Mr. 
Lewis's cousin, David Rickman, walked out toward the truck and spoke to Mr. Evans. 
Mr. Evans's and Mr. Lewis's versions of what happened next diverge. 
Mr. Evan's version of events is that Mr. Rickman noticed he was holding 
electrical tape and asked for some, which Mr. Evans provided.2 Mr. Rickman then 
walked to the back of the truck, where Mr. Evans heard him talking to someone. He 
assumed it was Mr. Lewis, who came back out to the truck shortly after Mr. Rickman. 
Mr. Lewis then walked to the front passenger door where Mr. Evans was sitting 
sideways, with the door open. Mr. Lewis was holding what appeared to Mr. Evans to be 
2 Both counsel asked at trial why Mr. Evans was carrying electrical tape. Mr. 
Evans had no explanation other than that it is useful.

a handgun (it turned out to be a BB gun) and began asking him accusatory questions 
about the night before, when Mr. Evans had shared some heroin with Michelle Curran, 
Mr. Lewis's girlfriend. It is not clear what Mr. Lewis's questions implied, but Mr. Evans 
objected, telling him, "You've got this wrong." Report of Proceedings (RP) at 167. 
As Mr. Evans sought to placate Mr. Lewis, Mr. Rickman had walked to and 
opened the truck's driver's side door. He reached in and struck the back of Mr. Evans's 
head with a wooden table leg, to the end of which (using electrical tape) he had attached a 
large hex nut bolt. After he was struck a couple of times, Mr. Evans believes (but is not 
sure) that Mr. Lewis grabbed him, pulled him out of the truck, and threw him to the 
ground. He claims Mr. Lewis and Mr. Rickman continued to kick and beat him while he 
was on the ground, telling him to give them his "stuff," which he assumed meant his 
drugs. RP at 169. He was carrying heroin. The two men finally stopped when Ms. 
Curran, who Mr. Evans was unaware had arrived at the scene, said, "Hey, that's enough." 
RP at 170 .. Seeing Ms. Curran, Mr. Evans pleaded with her to tell the men he had not 
done anything. When it appeared she was not going to say anything to help him, he fled. 
He first hid in a field and then sought help at a home in the area, whose owners let 
him in and called police. Mr. Evans lied to the responding deputy sheriff, Deputy Nathan 
Conley, telling him he was walking down the street when he was jumped by two 
3

State v. Lewis 
() 
unknown men. 3 (He later explained that he lied because he was carrying heroin and did 
not want to admit the drug involvement.) That night, however, he provided Deputy 
Conley with a description of the men and of the brown and black backpack he claimed 
they had taken, which bore the letters "FUL" across the front. He also told the deputy 
that after being chased and hiding, he observed a white Chevrolet pickup truck going up 
and down the road that he believed was involved. While being interviewed by Deputy 
Conley, medics evaluated Mr. Evans, and asked. to transport him to a hospital. He 
declined the ambulance transport, later explaining that he could not afford it. 
Information provided by Mr. Evans was enough to enable a patrol deputy to locate 
Mr. Lewis's truck and pull it over. The patrol deputy observed a backpack in the truck 
that met Mr. Evans's description. When asked about the backpack, Mr. Lewis told the 
patrol deputy it was his. He claimed to know nothing about any assault or attempted 
robbery. 
The patrol deputy arranged for Deputy Conley to transport Mr. Evans for a field 
showup. When Mr. Evans identified Mr. Lewis as one of his attackers and identified the 
backpack, the patrol deputy placed Mr. Lewis under arrest. In a search incident to arrest, 
he recovered drug paraphernalia that proved to contain residue. He did not find Mr. 
Lewis to be carrying any cash. 
3 In a conversation with the deputy sheriff the next day, Mr. Evans admitted lying, 
that a planned drug exchange had led to the assault, and that he knew Mr. Lewis.

Mr. Lewis consented to Deputy Conley's search of his truck, during which the 
deputy located Mr. Evans's wallet and cell phone. In a search of the bed of the truck, the 
deputy found the modified table leg and showed it to Mr. Evans. Mr. Evans expressed 
his belief that it was the weapon used in the assault. The deputy sheriff also noticed 
blood on Mr. Lewis's shirt and arranged for it to be taken into evidence once Mr. Lewis 
arrived at the jail. DNA in the blood stain on the shirt later proved to be a match for Mr. 
Evans. A BB pistol was later found in the passenger compartment of the truck. 
The deputy sheriff read Mr. Lewis Miranda4 warnings and Mr. Lewis agreed to 
speak. When asked generally about his activities that evening, he described taking 
friends to Walmart and going to his mother's house, but made no mention of any assault 
or robbery. When asked more pointedly about a robbery or assault, Mr. Lewis said he 
saw two men assaulting another man, but he was not involved. Asked why, if he was not 
involved, he had the victim's backpack and property, Mr. Lewis said he did not know. 
The deputy sheriff later described Mr. Lewis as appearing to be "under some sort of 
influence" during the questioning. RP at 66.

Later in the evening, on the advice of the deputy sheriff, Mr. Evans went to the 
emergency room. He had a wound on the back of his head that was open and bleeding, a 
hematoma on his side, a fractured hip, and a broken pelvis. 
Mr. Lewis was charged with first degree assault, first degree robbery, possession 
of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Deadly weapon 
enhancements were charged in connection with the first two counts. 
At trial, the State presented evidence of all of the foregoing matters. Mr. Lewis 
testified in his own defense. His version of events was largely consistent with Mr. 
Evans' s up to the point where Mr. Lewis returned to the truck from his apartment and 
began questioning Mr. Evans. Mr. Lewis said he merely asked Mr. Evans "what might 
have happened that night before ... just to get clarification." RP at 243. He testified that 
he never pulled Mr. Evans out of the truck, and that Mr. Evans got out on his own after 
being struck two times by Mr. Rickman. He testified that Mr. Evans was "actually 
knocked out" by Mr. Rickman's blows, and that it was he who stopped Mr. Rickman's 
attack by telling him, "That's enough." RP at 245. He denied ever striking or kicking 
Mr. Evans and testified that he tried to help him. According to him, when Mr. Evans 
regained consciousness he started "swinging everywhere" and hit Ms. Curran, who had 
approached the truck. RP at 244. 
Mr. Lewis testified he took nothing from Mr. Evans that night. Instead, when Mr. 
Evans fled, he left his belongings behind. He claimed the assault on Mr. Evans was

o· 
committed by Mr. Rickman alone. The only explanation he offered for Mr. Rickman's 
actions was that his cousin "has a very- temper when he-when he's high." RP at 261. 
The jury found Mr. Lewis guilty of all counts and returned special verdicts that 
Mr. Lewis or an accomplice was armed with a deadly weapon during the assault and the 
robbery. Mr. Lewis appeals. 
ANALYSIS 
Mr. Lewis makes one assignment of error to the sufficiency of the evidence to 
prove he was guilty of first degree assault as a principal, and another to whether the 
evidence was sufficient to prove him guilty of first degree assault as an accomplice. The 
jury was instructed on accomplice accountability and could have found Mr. Lewis guilty 
as a principal or accomplice. We need not examine whether the evidence was sufficient 
to prove both. 
First degree assault was charged under RCW 9A.36.0l l(l)(a). The to-convict 
instruction set forth the essential elements the State was required to prove: 
To convict the Defendant of the crime of Assault in the First Degree 
as charged in Count 1, each of the following elements of the crime must be 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt: 
(1) That on or about the 4th day of April 2017, the Defendant or an 
accomplice assaulted Michael Evans; 
(2) That the assault was committed with a deadly weapon or by a 
force or means likely to produce great bodily harm or death; 
(3) That the Defendant or the accomplice acted with intent to inflict 
great bodily harm; and

(4) That the acts occurred in Asotin County, the State of

Clerk's Papers (CP) at 27. Mr. Lewis argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove 
the second and third elements of the instruction beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The standard of review for a defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the 
evidence requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and 
determine "whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the 
charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Brown, 162 Wn.2d 422,428, 173 
P.3d 245 (2007). "A claim of insufficiency admits the truth of the State's evidence and 
all inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom." State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192, 
201, 829 P.2d 1068 (1992). "In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, 
circumstantial evidence is not to be considered any less reliable than direct evidence." 
State v. Delmarter, 94 Wn.2d 634,638,618 P.2d 99 (1980). This court defers to the fact 
finder on issues of witness credibility and persuasiveness of the evidence. State v. 
Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 874-75, 83 P.3d 970 (2004), ajf'd, 166 Wn.2d 380,208 P.3d

THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO PROVE USE OF A DEADLY WEAPON 
In connection with the second element-that the assault was committed with a 
deadly weapon or by a force or means likely to produce great bodily harm or death- the 
8 

--- Page 22 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
State's theory was that the repurposed table leg wielded by Mr. Rickman was a deadly 
weapon. 
Jurors were instructed that "deadly weapon" means 
any weapon, device, instrument, substance, or article, which under the 
circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be 
used, is readily capable of causing death or substantial bodily harm. 
CP at 31 (Instruction 9). The circumstances of a weapon's use include the intent 
and present ability of the use, the degree of force, the part of the body to which it 
was applied, and the physical injuries inflicted. State v. Winings, 126 Wn. App. 
75, 88, 107 P.3d 141 (2005). 
The table leg was used by Mr. Rickman to strike Mr. Evans in the head. Even Mr. 
Lewis admitted that it was a "serious weapon" with "a lot of heft." RP at 251-52. The 
leg was admitted into evidence, and in closing argument, the State encouraged jurors to 
examine it: 
[L]adies and gentlemen of the jury, pick this thing up. You'll go back-
you'll get-get to take this back with you. Pick it up. Feel the heft. Feel 
the weight on the end. Think about the damage that could be done to a 
person's skull, striking them with this-this-this implement. 
RP at 316. 
In its own closing argument, the defense did not contest the characterization of the 
table leg as a deadly weapon. It admitted that evidence Mr. Evans was struck twice in the 
back of the head with the table leg "is consistent with what you saw in the pictures. 
9

Clearly he was struck." RP at 330. The defense told jurors that "Mr. Rickman did indeed 
attack Mr. Evans." RP at 331. The defense challenged only whether the State had 
proved that Mr. Lewis participated in the assault as a principal or as Mr. Rickman's 
accomplice. The State's evidence was sufficient to prove use of a deadly weapon. 
II. 
THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH THAT MR. LEWIS AND MR. 
RICKMAN ACTED IN CONCERT AND THAT ONE OR BOTH OF THEM ACTED WITH 
INTENT TO INFLICT GREAT BODILY HARM 
Mr. Lewis makes a multifaceted challenge to the sufficiency of the State's 
evidence to prove that acting as a principal or accomplice, he intended, in assaulting Mr. 
Evans, to inflict great bodily harm. 
First degree assault requires proof of specific intent, which is intent to produce a 
specific result: in the case of first degree assault, to inflict great bodily harm. State v. 
Elmi, 166 Wn.2d 209,215,207 P.3d 439 (2009). In determining intent, the "jury may 
consider the manner in which the defendant exerted the force and the nature of the 
victim's injuries to the extent that it reflects the amount or degree of force necessary to 
cause the injury." State v. Pierre, 108 Wn. App. 378, 385, 31 P.3d 1207 (2001). While 
specific intent may not be presumed, the jury may infer it "as a logical probability from 
all the facts and circumstances." State v. Wilson, 125 Wn.2d 212,217,883 P.2d 320 
(1994). 
Mr. Lewis first argues the State failed to prove that Mr. Evans sustained great 
bodily harm, which was defined for jurors as bodily injury "that creates a probability of 
10 

--- Page 24 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
(J 
0 
death or which causes significant, serious impairment, disfigurement or that causes a 
significant permanent loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part or organ." RP 
at 288. But the third element of the to-convict instruction required only proof that the 
defendant intended to inflict great bodily harm, not that such harm was inflicted, 
consistent with RCW 9A.36.01 l(l)(a). 
Mr. Lewis next argues that the State's evidence was insufficient to prove even an 
intent to inflict great bodily harm. Two of his arguments can be rejected summarily: he 
contends there was no evidence of any plan to use the table leg as a weapon, and that Mr. 
Lewis stopped the attack by saying, "[T]hat's enough." RP at 170. Those arguments 
view the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Lewis, contrary to the standard of 
review. Direct evidence from Mr. Evans established that it was Ms. Curran, not Mr. 
Lewis, who uttered words that suspended the attack. And the attackers' opportunity to 
identify the table leg.as a weapon, its modification, and Mr. Rickman's use of it is 
sufficient circumstantial evidence of a plan to use it as a weapon. 
Mr. Lewis also argues there was not enough evidence of blood or physical 
evidence of a fight at the scene to prove the required intent. He also attaches significance 
to the fact that Mr. Evans was well enough to travel to a field showup before going to the 
hospital. 
Using a bludgeon to strike someone's skull and kicking someone on the ground 
with enough force to fracture a hip, break a pelvis, and cause the discoloration and

State v. Lewis

swelling observed by Deputy Conley, could be found by a reasonable juror as evincing an 
intent to cause great bodily injury. And jurors could reasonably infer that Mr. Rickman 
and Mr. Lewis intended more harm than they inflicted, since Mr. Lewis was able to 
escape. The evidence was sufficient to prove the required specific intent. 
Finally, Mr. Lewis challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his 
liability as an accomplice_. Specifically, he argues that the State was required to prove his 
knowledge that Mr. Rickman intended to inflict great bodily harm. Br. of Appellant at 
13. 
A person is an accomplice to a crime if "with knowledge that it will promote or 
facilitate the commission of the crime, he or she . .. encourages ... [another] person to 
commit [ the crime] ... or ... [ a ]ids or agrees to aid another person in planning or 
committing [the crime]." RCW 9A.08.020(3). "[A] jury is not required to determine 
-which participant acted as a principal and which participant acted as an accomplice." In 
re Pers. Restraint ofHegney, 138 Wn. App. 511, 524, 158 P.3d 1193 (2007). Contrary to 
Mr. Lewis's argument, the State was required to present evidence that Mr. Lewis acted 
on a plan to assault Mr. Evans- not that he foresaw that his and Mr. Rickman's actions 
would qualify as first degree assault. It is a longstanding rule that "an accomplice need 
not have specific knowledge of every element of the crime committed by the principal, 
provided that he, the accomplice, has general knowledge of that specific crime." In re· 
12 

--- Page 26 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
0 
Pers. Restraint of Sarausad, 109 Wn. App. 824, 835, 39 P.3d 308 (2001). Where the 
charge is assault in the first or second degree, 
an accused ... must have known generally that he was facilitating an 
assault, even if only a simple, misdemeanor level assault, and need not have 
known that the principal was going to use deadly force or that the principal 
was armed. 
Id. at 836. 
The evidence was more than sufficient to prove that Mr. Lewis acted as an 
accomplice. It included Mr. Evans's testimony that Mr. Lewis was one of his attackers, 
throwing him from the truck onto the ground, and kicking him. 
Even if jurors believed that only Mr. Rickman had inflicted the physical harm, 
plenty of circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, 
supported the State's theory that Mr. Lewis enlisted his cousin's help to assault Mr. 
Evans and take his heroin. There was a detour to Mr. Lewis's apartment, where Mr. 
Rickman coincidentally appeared and approached Mr. Evans and the truck. Mr. Evans 
testified to his belief that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Rickman spoke together quietly before Mr. 
Rickman's attack. While Mr. Lewis distracted Mr. Evans with puzzling questioning, Mr. 
Rickman reached through the driver's side door to strike Mr. Lewis from behind with his 
repurposed weapon-an action for which the State's theory appeared to be the only 
plausible explanation. When stopped by police and questioned, Mr. Lewis falsely 
claimed that Mr. Evans's backpack was his and made inconsistent statements (although 
13 

--- Page 27 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
A 
X::fl 
continually false statements) about what he knew about an assault taking place earlier in 
the evening. The search incident to arrest revealed that Mr. Lewis was carrying no 
money, yet his reason for picking up Mr. Evans had ostensibly been to make a drug 
purchase. Mr. Lewis's version of events was full of holes. We defer to the jurors' 
decision not to believe him. 
Ill. 
WE GRANT MR. LEWIS' S MOTION TO REMAND WITH DIRECTIONS TO STRIKE TWO 
LEGAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS (LFOs) 
Relying on State v. Ramirez, 191 Wn.2d 732,426 P.3d 714 (2018), which was 
decided after Mr. Lewis filed his opening brief, Mr. Lewis filed a motion to strike the 
criminal filing and DNA collection fees imposed in his judgment and sentence. Ramirez 
holds that amendments made in 2018 to Washington's legal financial obligation system, 
which provide relief to offenders in a number of respects, apply prospectively to cases on 
direct review. Id at 749-50. 
The 2018 amendments prohibit imposition of a $200 criminal filing fee on 
defendants who are indigent at the time of sentencing as defined by RCW 
10.101.010(3)(a)-(c). RCW 36.18.020(2)(h). Mr. Lewis was found by the trial court to 
be indigent for purposes of appeal. 
The amendments prohibit the assessment of a DNA database fee if the State has 
previously collected the defendant's DNA as a result of a prior conviction. RCW 
43.43.7541. Mr. Lewis's criminal history reveals several prior felonies, on the basis of 
14 

--- Page 28 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
which we will accept his contentionthat his DNA has been collected before. We grant 
Mr. Lewis the relief requested by his motion and direct the trial court to strike the $200 
filing fee and $100 DNA fee from his judgment and sentence. 
STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS 
In a pro se statement of additional grounds (SAG), Mr. Lewis raises two. He first 
argues that the "county jail'' had him wear an orange jail-issued shirt at trial. SAG at 1. 
Several witnesses, when asked to identify Mr. Lewis in the courtroom, described him as 
wearing an orange shirt. Two of them described him as wearing a blue or green shirt 
over the orange shirt, however. 
"' The State cannot, consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth 
Amendment, compel a defendant to stand trial before a jury dressed in jail attire 
identifiable by a jury as such."' State v. Sanchez, 122 Wn. App. 579, 587, 94 P.3d 384 
(2004) (quoting State v. Stevens, 35 Wn. App. 68, 70,665 P.2d 426 (1983)). Instances 
arise where a defendant chooses to stand trial in prison garments, however, so " '[t]he 
particular evil proscribed is compelling a defendant, against his will, to be tried in jail 
attire.,,, Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501,508, 96 S. 
Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976)). Courts require an accused to object to being tried in 
jail garments, '"just as he must invoke or abandon other rights."' Id. lfMr. Lewis's 
orange shirt was jail attire, he did not object that he was being required to wear it. The 
issue was not preserved. 
15 

--- Page 29 ---
No. 35775-9-III 
State v. Lewis 
0 
0 
Mr. Lewis's second ground is that his trial lawyer failed to strike a juror despite 
Mr. Lewis telling the lawyer that the juror had done work at the county jail and would 
recognize him as an inmate. Nothing about this appears in the record. Because this court 
has no ability to assess this argument without a record, Mr. Lewis's remedy is to seek 
relief by personal restraint petition. State v. Norman, 61 Wn. App. 16, 27-28, 808 P .2d 
1159 ( 1991 ). To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, he will need to demonstrate that 
his trial lawyer's representation was both deficient and prejudicial. See State v. 
McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35, 899 P.2d 12S 1 (1995) (citing Strickland v. 
Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)). 
We affirm the assault conviction and remand with directions to strike the court's 
imposition of the criminal filing and DNA collection fees. 
A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the 
Washington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW 
2.06.040.

After looking at the attachment Bob provided (from your legal perspective), do you believe we can offer him a contract

I have attached a copy of the Washington Rule regarding admission to practice (Pro hac vice) of public 
defenders awaiting reciprocal admission. I wanted to let the Commissioners know that there is a rule allowing 
admission of lawyers who are doing public defense work pending receipt of their license. This is covered under

DIVISION Ill 
IN RE THE PRP OF: 
JUSTIN LEWIS 
COA NO. 37284-7-111 
DECLARATION OF TAMMY TENNY 
COURT ADMINISTRATOR 
DECLARATION 
Asotin County Superior Court contacted Robert Vanldour via e-mail to inquire of the status of his 
licensure, (see attached e-mail dated March 2, 2017 and follow-up e-mail dated March 17, 2017). Mr. 
Vanldour's response was that the Admissions Department was currently processing his application. 
After several weeks, I called the Washington State Bar Association and spoke with Barbara Ochota 
of the Admissions Department and inquired status regarding Mr. Vanldour's application. Ms. Ochota stated 
that the application was submitted and could take up to 6 months to process. 
On September 5, 2017, I contacted Ms. Ochota via e-mail for follow-up regarding status of Mr. 
Vanldour's application. Ms. Ochota's response was that it was being reviewed by regulatory service counsel. 
On October 26, 2017, Mr. Vanldour forwarded an e-mail from the WSBA stating that the application 
had been approved and that the admissions process needed to be completed. 
On January 31, 2018, Judge Gallina received an e-mail from Mr. Vanldour advising that he had 
received an e-mail from Ms. Biestek of the WSBA stating that the Order of Conditional Admission was not 
sufficient basis for allowing him to practice in Superior Court. 
Communications regarding my inquiries of the Status of Mr. Vanldour's application are attached as 
well as a letter from the WSBA to Judge Gallina and Judge Gallina's response.

Dear J~dge Gallina 
I 
VIA U.S. MAIL ONLY 
Idaho ~ttorney Jerry Van ldour (ID Bar No. 2644) is not presently and never has been licensed to practice 
law in ihe state of Washington under any provision of the Washington Supreme Court Admission and 
Practiqe Rules (AP Rs). This information is of public record in that all individuals who have been licensed 
to pra4tice law in this state can be found in the Legal Directory at 
https:f/www.my\A/sba.org/LegalDirectory.aspx, whether or not they are currently in active status. A 
search for Mr. Van ldour in this Legal Directory returns no results. 
i 
The ~shington Supreme Court has the sole authority to grant admission to the practice of law in this 
state. ~ecause the Washington Supreme Court has not issued an order authorizing Mr. Van ldour's 
admis~ion to practice law under any provision, he is not authorized to practice law in Washington. 
If Mr. yan ldour has made representations to you and/or other staff or officials of your court that he has 
the a~hority to practice law in Washington under APR 8 or any other provision, we respectfully request 
that y~u provide us information and documentation, if any, of such representations.

Re: JenyV an ldour 
I 
Dem/ Ms. Biestek 
I 
February 22, 2018 
This; letter is written in response to your correspondence of February 13, 2018. Given recent events 
here;1 cannot say your inquiry comes as a complete surprise as we, too, have had serious and 
continuing concerns about the representations being made to us regarding Mr. Van !dour' s ability to 
prac;tice here under APR 8. While your references to the legal directory are undoubtedly accurate, 
we y.rould never have: expected to see Mr. Van !dour listed therein. Were he licensed, he would not 
hav~ to seek approval for limited admission. 
I . 
I ~ 
a historical overview would be helpful. The Asotin County Commissioners put out requests 
for ~ids for indigent defense services for the period spanning 2/1/2017-2/1/2018. Only two 
responsive bids were. up for consideration despite our need for 3-4 attorneys, 11).e commissioners 
inqljrired of county counsel and me as to whether or not Mr. Van !dour could be offered a contract. 
See!A-ttacbment A. They were advised that there was a path to do so, as long as the requirements of 
AP:(l(8) subsection C were satisfied. 
' 
' 
Shtjrtly th~eafter, Mr. Van ldour advised that he would be under the supervision of Mr. Neil Cox, 
an ~omey in good standing and well known to the court. Mr. Van !dour advised that, pursuant to 
the:rule, he had applied to the bar for admission under the rule, was associated with an active 
meplber of the Bar, ~d that be bad filed an application for admission by motion and was good to 
I 
go., 
Th~reafter, Mr. Van/Idour assumed his duties here as indigent defense counsel. Because of the 
~ue circum.stan~s under which the application was made and no specification existing in the 
rul~, we did not ex~t any formal notification from the Bar and relied instead on counsel's 
re*esentations. 
I 
I 

--- Page 43 ---
. I 
-I 
. 
I 
t 
Upo.d direct inquizy about his status, he advised that after speaking with Bar Association, he had 
met ·411 preliminary req., uirements and was authorized to practice and that his full admission to the 
Bar tould take a couple of months. Time went on and numerous inquiries were made by our 
Cowft Administrator advising the Bar that Mr. Van Idour was acting as indigent counsel here and 
requ¢sting information as to the status of his admission. We were told that the process was 
contijnuing and no ~er information could be provided. The Bar also contacted us in regard Mr. 
Van idour's rendering of services here and his supervising attorney. The Bar was given Mr. Cox's 
conn,ct information. ~t no time were we ever contacted or advised regarding any problem with Mr. 
Van f dour' s admissiof status. 
I 
; 
As "Ve progressed into the fall-of 2017, we began to press Mr. Van Idour for more specific 
infothiation regarding his communications and status with the 'bar. His answers were unsatisfactory. 
I ad'{ised him that I needed to see some kind of order admitting him Pro Hoc Vice. He submitted a 
· couple of drafts which were rejected and he was referred back to the Bar. See Attachment .B. He 
advised us that he needed something from us to submit to the bar showing his acceptance by the 
comi. 
I 
i 
On (j>ctober 6, 2017, to accommodate his request, I drafted an order for our files to document our 
acceptance of Mr. Van ldour. See, Attachment('.. He was advised however that this was not a 
substitute for Bar approval. Mr. Van Idour continued to submit additional orders which were 
rejeqted. See Atfae~e~ I), 
I 
Firi~ly, on October 26, 2017, Mr. Van !dour advised that his_request for admission to the bar had 
beeq approved. See Attaclnn~t-~. Nonetheless, we pressedhim for a bar number to which he 
· re·sppnded that he had a couple of loose ends to take care.of but that he was still operating under 
AP~ 8. He was again referred back to the rules to insure hi~ compliance. See Attacbment F,. He was 
alsojadvised that his ~R 8 status would terminate on the one year anniversary of his admission by 
rule1ifhe did not have a bar number by that time. We repeatedly inquired of the Bar but were told 
that /fue information was confidential. 
; 
·we ~ere incredulo~s that, by the end of January 2018, Mr. Van Idour still did not have a bar 
nWJ1.ber and could not give a n:ieaningful response to our ·direct questions regarding the hold up in 
his :final approval. Finally, on January 31, 2018, Mr. Van ldour advised for the first ti.me that there 
wasian issue with his Pro Hoc Vice status despite our inquiries of him for the past calendar year. 
See Attachment G. Mr. Van Idour was immediately advised that he had no authority to appear 
furtti,er as counsel in any case pending in our court. 
I 
Yoqr letter of February 13, 2018 was the first direct communication I have received from the Bar 
regih-ding Mr. Van Idour.

Good Eveping.; I reviewed the prior format I sent in the Kyle Light case. Based on my recoll~on of our· 
discussio~ I have prepared a broader Order as an administrative Order. I would attach a copy ofmy case lists 
as submittpd to Tammy earli~r to provide Defendant's names and case numbers: I would also attach Neil's · 
statement pf supervision to provide a more blanket coverage for the pro hac vice status. The alternative would 
be orders· (or each case, which I think would ·be cumbersome to administer. If this format an4 idea works for 
you let mq know and I wm submit ( via email) a final draft.

Barbara at the Admissions Department is the one with whom I am dealing. I will check again with her next

started on it on Monday, per the phone conversation I had with her.

Bob: The clerk's office rec'd a fax of an Interim Order for Pro Hae Vice appearance on Kyle Light. I believe the judge was 
asking you to submit a general order of Pro Hae Vice which will also require sign off by you. 
Please follow-up with Judge Gallina on Monday regarding clarification of what is required for this order. 
Thank you.

Bob: Please be advised that Judge Gallina has stressed the importance of getting the Pro Hae Vice order in place 
numerous times. This needs to be in place no later than Friday, October 21ttt, 2017. If the court does not receive a 
signed order (signed by you and Neil Cox), by that date then Judge Gallina will need to suspend your 
contract/services. Thank you.

Pro Hae vice order 
In the Matter of Listed CasesAdministrative Order.docx 
Good Evening- I reviewed the prior format I sent in the Kyle Light case. Based on my recollection of our 
discussions I have prepared a broader Order as an administrative Order. I would attach a copy ofmy case lists 
as submitted to Tammy earlier to provide Defendant's names and case numbers. I would also attach Neil's· 
statement of supervision to provide a more blanket coverage for the pro hac vice status. The alternative would 
be orders for each case, which I think would be cumbersome to administer. Ifthis format and idea works for 
you let me know and I will submit (via email) a final draft. 
Thank you for your consideration 9f this matter.

Good evening- I have attached a draft of a Pro Hae Vice Order for Judge Gallina's review. I patterned it after the 
Limited Admission Order of October 6th which Tammy forwarded to me. The case list is taken from my 
caseload reports. I have also attached Neil Cox's certificate as attorney of record. Please let me know if this 
works for you. 
I have attached a revised first page of the Order. The only change from the full draft is that the retroactive date 
was changed from February 6th to February 3rd. 
Thanks.

Re: Pro Hae Vice order 
I applied under APR 8(B). This is the limited admissions rule that governs public defenders. I applied for that 
earlier this year. It appears that this is the admission granted by Judge Gallina in the October 6th Order that you 
forwarded to me. I submitted the certificates signed by the Commission and Neil Cox as part of that process. 
The admission under that rule is limited to my public defender cases. 
Does this answer your question? If not please let me know. 
Thanks.

Re: WSBA admission 
This isn't making me all warm and fuzzy. Please contact the other public defenders and arrange a contingency 
plan for the immediate transfer of all of your pending cases should that become necessary by the February 5, 
2018, docket. These continuing problems are being nebulously expressed and it does not appear that there is a 
clear path to a resolution. As the bar will not speak with us directly, you are our only conduit for information.

Good Morning- I called Ms. Biestek at the WSBA yesterday. I did not receive a return call, but did get an email 
from her. The email stated that the Order of Conditional Admission was not sufficient basis for allowing me to 
practice in Superior Court. She asked for a case list of the matters I worked on and a summary of what I did. I 
emailed her that information. She also asked if I had associated with another attorney. I provided her with a 
copy of the notice that Neil Cox signed originally back when I applied under APR8(c). She asked for a copy of 
any Notice of Appearances. In response I told her that the practice was to use an Order Appointing Attorney 
instead of an appearance notice. That is the status as of yesterday afternoon.
