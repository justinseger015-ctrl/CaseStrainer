Appellant Proponent C Davis respectfully submits the 
following supplemental statement of authority in support of its 
opening brief and reply brief on file with this court.
It is a striking coincidence that the published opinion, in 
Gonzales v. Inslee, was written on February 23rd, 2022, one day 
after our reply brief was filed.  
In our reply brief, we replied to Governor Inslee’s 
response brief's claim that there was no evidence that landlords 
have been harmed by Governor Inslee's violation of separation 
of powers. The Horwath article cited in our reply brief was 
cited solely as an anecdotal example of a harmed landlord. 
Others examples were also given, they are plentiful, as we 
stated in the reply. We made no determination on the merits of 
the Gonzales case.
Even if the appellate court made an opinion on the 
constitutionality, it does not change the fact that the Gonzales' 
were harmed.  Though the appellate court made an opinion of 
the Gonzales case, it is by no means a final determination.  That

case will likely precede to the Washington Supreme Court.
Quoting, in Brown v. Owen, 165 Wn.2d 706, cited in the 
Notice of Supplemental Authority:
“None of the proclamation provisions are directed
to the courts, and the proclamations do not purport to 
prevent the courts from taking any actions.” 
Though the proclamation does not prevent courts from 
TAKING action, it does prevent the court from initiating action,
which on its face is interference.  This was pointed out in both 
our opening brief and our reply brief.
Political questions are "'political and governmental, and 
embraced within the scope of the powers conferred upon 
Congress [Legislature], and not therefore within the reach of
judicial power.'" State v. Manussier, 129 Wn.2d 652, 670-71,
921 P.2d 473 (1996) (quoting Pac. States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. 
Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 151, 32 S. Ct. 224, 56 L. Ed. 377 
(1912)). Where the judicial branch is involved, our primary 
concerns are that the judiciary not be drawn into tasks more 
appropriate to another branch and that its institutional 
integrity be protected. Carrick, 125 Wn.2d at 136 
(citing Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 383, 109 S. 
Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989)).

This is the result of prohibiting a landlord from filing a writ of 
unlawful detainer, as a device of imposing an eviction 
moratorium, which is a political matter. As we stated in our 
reply regarding the AG's note that Washington's failing 
economy and it's out of control homeless problem are political 
policy issues and do not relate to separation of power.
Pursuant to RAP 18.17, I hereby certify there are 628 words 
in this brief as indicated by the word processing program used 
in preparation.
Dated this 25th day of February, 2022.
