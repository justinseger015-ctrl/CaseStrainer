I. IDENTITY AND INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE 
The Washington State Association for Justice Foundation 
is a not-for-profit corporation organized under Washington law, 
and a supporting organization to Washington State Association 
for Justice. The Foundation operates an amicus program and has 
an interest in the rights of persons seeking redress under the civil 
justice system, including an interest in the interpretation of the 
Washington Product Liability Act, ch. 7. 72 RCW (WPLA). 
II. INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
This case presents the Court with the opportunity to decide 
whether Washington's learned intermediary doctrine (LID) -
a 
common law exception to manufacturers' duty to warn -
should 
apply when prescription drug manufacturers engage in direct-to-
consumer marketing (DTCM). The facts are drawn from the 
certification order and the parties' briefs. See Dearinger v. Eli 
Lilly and Company, No. C21-0060-JCC, 2021 WL 2805328 
(W.D. Wash. July 6, 2021); Op. Br. at 5-19; Resp. Br. at 4-12.

Background Regarding DTCM of Prescription Drugs1 
Manufacturers of prescription products historically focused 
their marketing on medical providers. See Cecilia Plaza, Cutting 
out the Middleman: 
Empirically Testing the Continued 
Applicability of the Learned Intermediary Rule in the Age of 
Direct-to-Consumer 
Advertising 
of 
Prescription 
Pharmaceuticals, 24 Quinnipiac L.J. 393,403, 405 (2021 ). In the 
early 1980s, however, manufacturers introduced DTCM of 
prescription drugs, and it has since grown exponentially. See 
Plaza at 403; Op. Br. at 25. From 1997-2016, DTCM increased 
from $2.1 billion to $9.6 billion. See Lisa M. Schwartz, et al., 
Medical Marketing in the United States, 1997-2016, J. Am. Med. 
Ass'n, Vol. 321, No. 1, 80 (2019). From 2016-2018, $17.8 billion 
was spent on DTCM. See U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO 
21-380, Prescription Drugs: Medicare Spending on Drugs with 
Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, at 9 (May, 2021). 
1 The materials cited herein offer important factual context for the 
public policies that bear on the certified question. Courts may take 
judicial notice of "legislative facts" that "supply premises in the 
process of legal reasoning." Wyman v. Wallace, 94 Wn.2d 99, 
102, 615 P.2d 452 (1980) (citation omitted). Of course, if the 
Court requires additional factual or legal analysis, it may request 
further briefing. 
2 

--- Page 10 ---
One study reports that DTCM television ads generally do 
not appeal to "rational consideration of medical costs and 
benefits." See Dominick L. Frosch, et al., Creating Demand/or 
Prescription Drugs: A Content Analysis of Television Direct-to-
Consumer Advertising, Ann. Fam. Med., Vol. 5, No. 1, 6, 12 
(2007). Some ads include "find a doctor" features directing 
consumers to 
providers willing to prescribe particular 
pharmaceuticals; others encourage consumers to schedule 
"telemedicine" visits and obtain prescription drugs from home. 
See Schwartz at 88. Ads tend to be "low quality," offering 
anecdotes and testimonials, and presenting little quantifiable or 
educational information. See id.; Frosch, at 6. 
A follow-up to the Frosch study reported that ad quality is 
declining, disproportionately emphasizing drug benefits through 
emotional appeals at the expense of education. See Janelle 
Applequist, et al., An Updated Analysis of Direct-to-Consumer 
Television Advertisements for Prescription Drugs, Ann. Fam. 
Med., Vol. 16, No. 3, 211, 214-15 (2018). There is concern that 
DTCM increases "medicalization" of natural human experiences, 
encouraging drug use that is both unnecessary and risky. See

DFFRPSOLVK´ Frosch, at 12.  
Only the United States and New Zealand permit DTCM of 
prescription drugs. See Schwartz, at 87. Many states have enacted 
legislation to control or limit DTCM, though Washington is not 
one of them. See Marketing and Advertising of Pharmaceuticals, 
1DW¶O Conf. of State Legislatures (Nov. 5, 2018). The American 
Medical Association, the American College of Physicians and the 
Institute of Medicine have all publicly opposed DTCM, with the 
AMA calling for an outright ban. See Schwartz, at 89; American 
College of Physicians, Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug 
Advertising Position Paper, at 1 (2006).  
 
FDA regulations impose a number of requirements on 
DTCM, including that it not be false, misleading or unbalanced. 
See 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e) (2008). The FDA has had limited ability 
to enforce compliance, however. See Frosch, at 12; Ashley Porter, 
Old Habits Die Hard: Reforming the Learned Intermediary 
Doctrine in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, 43 

--- Page 12 ---
McGeorge Law Review 433, 443 & n.91 (2012). Despite a 
dramatic increase in DTCM promotional materials during the 
same time period, FDA warning letters dropped from 156 in 1997 
to only 11 in 2016. See Schwartz, at 85. Disturbingly, violations 
increasingly reflect manufacturers' failure to adequately convey 
risk information. See id. 
Studies show DTCM significantly affects physicians' 
prescribing practices. Consumers disproportionately request 
DTCM drugs after viewing ads, and doctors frequently comply 
with such requests, including when they deem requests 
inappropriate. See Elizabeth Murray et al., Direct to Consumer 
Advertising: Physicians' Views of Its Effects on Quality of Care 
and the Doctor-Patient Relationship, J. Am. Board Fam. Pract. 
Vol. 16, No. 6,513, at 521-22. (Nov. 2003); Porter, at 452 & nn. 
173 & 174 (2012); Schwartz, at 88-90. 
DTCM prescription drugs may pose umque dangers. 
Because of the period of exclusivity afforded by the patent and 
FDA approval processes when new drugs enter the market, there 
is substantial financial incentive to focus DTCM on new drugs. 
See Plaza, at 403. Unfortunately, new drugs lack the more robust 
5 

--- Page 13 ---
vetting that occurs once a drug is circulated, and its full risks may 
be unknown or underestimated. See Alina Baciu, et al., The 
Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of 
the Public, Institute of Medicine, Nat'l Academies Press, at 1-2. 
(2007). For this reason, the Institute of Medicine recommended a 
DTCM moratorium in the period immediately following FDA 
approval. See id. at 11; see also Schwartz, at 89. 
After the period of market exclusivity, the financial 
incentive for DTCM drops. Accordingly, DTCM is focused on a 
small percentage of total marketable drugs. There are currently 
over 20,000 prescription drugs approved for marketing in the 
United States. See U.S. Food & Drug Administration, FDA at a 
Glance (Nov. 2021). Yet the GAO reports that from 2016-2018, 
DTCM targeted only 500 drugs, with 67% of funds used to market 
just 39. See GAO-21-380, at 9, 11. 
Among 
the 
most 
heavily 
promoted 
prescription 
medications in the United States is Lilly's erectile dysfunction 
drug, Cialis. See Op. Br. 7-10. After Cialis received FDA 
approval in 2003, Lilly launched an ambitious DTCM campaign. 
See id. In 2014, Cialis was number one in total dollars in 
6 

--- Page 14 ---
marketing, with $248. 7 million invested. See Allison Gilchrist, J 0 
Most-Advertised Brand-Name Drugs, Pharmacy Times, Aug. 27, 
2015. 
On January 17, 2018, Plaintiff David Dearinger suffered a 
stroke less than two hours after ingesting Cialis. The stroke left 
him paralyzed on his left side. The Cialis physician insert warned 
of "serious cardiovascular events, including . . . stroke." 
Dearinger, 2021 WL 2805328, at *1. However, the patient insert 
Dearinger received warned only of a risk of stroke if the drug "is 
taken with certain other medications." Id. 
Dearinger brought this action under the WPLA, alleging, 
inter alia, failure to adequately warn of the risks associated with 
Cialis. Lilly moved to dismiss, asserting application of the LID. 
Recognizing this Court has not had the opportunity to address 
whether the LID applies when a manufacturer markets directly to 
consumers, the federal district court stayed Lilly's motion and 
certified the question below to this Court. 
III. ISSUE PRESENTED 
7 

--- Page 15 ---
Is a manufacturer that promotes a prescription drug through 
DTCM still exempt from warning the consumer of that drug's 
dangerous side effects under Washington's LID?2 
IV. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 
The WPLA was enacted in 1981 and became the exclusive 
remedy for product liability claims. However, it carried forward 
many pre-existing common law principles, including the LID 
exception to manufacturers' duty to warn. 
The text of the WPLA, properly interpreted, reqmres 
warnings be provided directly to consumers. Without any support 
in the statutory language, the LID exception should be applied 
2 This question does not address whether Cialis qualifies as an 
unavoidably unsafe product within the meaning of Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 402A comment k (1965). Whether 
prescription drugs are categorically considered unavoidably 
unsafe is an open question in Washington. Compare Young v. Key 
Pharm., Inc., 130 Wn.2d 160, 170, 922 P.2d 59 (1996) (Guy, J., 
4-justice lead opinion stating prescription drugs categorically are 
unavoidably unsafe), with 130 Wn.2d at 179-88 (Madsen, J., 4-
Justice dissent not concurring on this point of law). In Ruiz-
Guzman v. Amvac Chem. Corp., 141 Wn.2d 493, 508, 7 P.3d 795 
(2000), the Court declined to resolve the question left open in 
Young. If the Court is inclined to consider this question, WSAJ 
Foundation is prepared to submit additional briefing. 
8 

--- Page 16 ---
sparingly and limited to its purposes, which are not served in the 
DTCM context. 
Neither concern for consumer confusion nor fear of 
excessive liability supports a contrary conclusion. Manufacturers 
already have an obligation to directly warn consumers, including 
for nonprescription drugs. Warnings need only be "adequate," 
and manufacturers have tools available to craft effective drug 
warnings. DTCM occupies only a small fraction of the 
prescription drug market, and whether to directly advertise and 
thereby assume a duty to directly warn is ultimately within the 
control of the manufacturer. 
Lilly's selected outside authorities provide no basis for 
departing from Washington law. Washington's comprehensive 
statutory scheme and decades of case law provide clear guidance 
to resolve the certified question. To the extent the Court deems 
outside sources persuasive at all, Lilly exaggerates the consensus 
among these authorities. The Court should apply Washington law 
and answer "no" to the certified question. 
V. ARGUMENT 
9 

--- Page 17 ---
Lilly asserts the certified question threatens to "abrogate 
deeply-established law." Resp. Br. at 20. However, the issue here 
is not whether to abandon the LID, but whether to recognize a 
narrow limitation to its application. In Wash. State Physicians 
Exch. & Ass'n v. Fisons Corp., 122 Wn.2d 299, 313, 858 P.2d 
1054 (1993), this Court explained the LID was based on the 
"unique" relationship among drug companies, physicians, and 
patients, and the assumption that "the drug company targets its 
marketing efforts toward the physician, not toward the patient." 
DTCM upsets these assumptions, directly influencing consumers' 
expectations by circumventing the line of communication 
presumed by the LID. Recognizing the limitation proposed here 
1s necessary to prevent DTCM from rendering products 
unreasonably unsafe by tipping the balance and distorting 
consumer expectations. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the 
text of the WPLA, disregard the assumptions underlying 
Washington's LID and frustrate the public safety purposes that 
undergird both. 
A. 
Overview Of Washington Product Liability Law, 
Including The LID. 
10 

--- Page 18 ---
In 1969, this Court adopted the strict liability standard from 
Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1965). See Ulmer v. Ford 
Motor Co., 75 Wn.2d 522, 530-32, 452 P.2d 729 (1969). In 
Seattle-First Nat'! Bank v. Tabert, 86 Wn.2d 145, 154, 542 P.2d 
774 (1975), it clarified this standard focused on "the consumer's 
reasonable expectation of buying a product which is reasonably 
safe." Considering the "intrinsic nature" of the product, the 
factfinder determined whether it was unreasonably unsafe, based 
on factors such as cost, gravity of potential harm, and feasibility 
of minimizing risk. See Tabert, 86 Wn.2d at 154. These principles 
were later extended to duty to warn claims. See Teagle v. Fischer 
& Porter Co., 89 Wn.2d 149, 155, 570 P.2d 438 (1977). 
The Legislature enacted the WPLA in 1981. See Laws of 
1981, ch. 27 (codified in RCW 7.72.010 et seq). RCW 7.72.030 
codifies the three theories of strict product liability-
manufacturing defect, defective design, and failure to warn. 
While the WPLA preempts common law product liability, it 
carried forward many principles animating Washington's 
common law strict liability scheme. See RCW 7.72.020(1); 
11 

--- Page 19 ---
Macias v. Saberhagen Holdings, Inc., 175 Wn.2d 402,409,282 
P.3d 1069 (2012). 
RCW 7.72.030(1) and (3) establish two independent 
grounds for strict liability for design defect and failure to warn. 
See Falk v. Keene Corp., 113 Wn.2d 645, 654, 782 P.2d 974 
(1989). A product may be unsafe under either the risk-utility or 
consumer expectations test. See RCW 7.72.030(l)(a)-(b) & (3); 
Falk, 113 Wn.2d at 654. 
In Terhune v. A.H. Robins Co., 90 Wn.2d 9, 577 P.2d 975 
(1978), this Court addressed a failure to warn claim involving a 
prescription medical product, establishing two rules of law. First, 
it adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A comment k 
(1965) as a limitation on common law strict liability for certain 
"unavoidably unsafe products." Second, it recognized an 
exception to manufacturers' duty to directly warn consumers, 
holding that adequacy of warnings in the prescription product 
context is measured by warnings to the doctor, not the patient, 
giving birth to the LID. See Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 12-14. Since 
Terhune, this Court has discussed the doctrine in four cases. See 
McKee v. American Home Prods. Corp., 113 Wn.2d 701, 709-12, 
12 

--- Page 20 ---
782 P.2d 1045 (1989); Fisons, 122 Wn.2d at 313; Young v. Key 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 130 Wn.2d 160, 167-68, 922 P.2d 59 
(1996); Taylor v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 187 Wn.2d 743, 757-60, 
389 P.3d 517 (2017). These cases did not meaningfully examine 
the extent to which the LID comports with the text of the WPLA, 
and none address whether the LID exception should apply to 
DTCM. 
B. 
The Court Should Limit The LID Exception To Its 
Purposes And Hold That It Is Inapplicable In The 
DTCM Context. 
In Ruiz-Guzman v. Amvac Chem. Corp., 141 Wn.2d 493, 
506, 7 P.3d 795 (2000), this Court observed that the related 
doctrine of comment k "was not expressly provided for by the 
Legislature in adopting the WPLA." It cautioned that its use 
should be "sparing .. .lest we defeat the letter or policy of the 
WPLA." Id., 141 Wn.2d at 506. 
The same principle holds for the LID. Lacking any basis in 
the text of the WPLA, its application should be limited to its 
purposes, which are absent in the DTCM context. 
1. 
There is no basis in the text of the WPLA for the 
LID, particularly in the DTCM context. 
13 

--- Page 21 ---
This Court has adopted the "plain meaning" rule of 
statutory interpretation, whereby meaning is gleaned from 
interpreting the statutory scheme in its full context. See Dep 't of 
Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-12, 43 P.3d 
4 (2002). Only if the text is ambiguous will the Court resort to 
rules of construction. See id, 146 Wn.2d at 12. 
Interpreted as a whole, the WPLA' s plain language requires 
product warnings be given directly to consumers. 
Preamble: The Legislature expressed its aim to "create a 
fairer and more equitable distribution ofliability among parties at 
fault." Laws of 1981, ch. 27 § I. While addressing concerns 
regarding 
msurance 
costs 
and 
"unwarranted" 
liability, 
particularly for "retail businesses located primarily in the state of 
Washington," it emphasized "the right of the consumer to recover 
for injuries sustained as a result of an unsafe product not be 
unduly impaired." Id. 
RCW 7.72.010(4) defines "product liability claim" to 
include "any claim or action brought for harm caused by" a range 
of product features and conduct, including "warnings" and 
14 

--- Page 22 ---
"marketing." The Legislature intended manufacturers' duties to 
attach where "marketing" renders a product unreasonably unsafe. 
RCW 7.72.030(1)(b), governing inadequate warnings, 
states an unsafe product is one "not reasonably safe because 
adequate warnings or instructions were not provided with the 
product." 
In Taylor, a case involving a medical product, this Court 
interpreted the phrase "with the product." It held that the phrase 
required warnings to the physician be supplemented by warnings 
to the purchaser (a hospital).3 A number of factors necessitated its 
conclusion: 
• the purchaser played an active role in the purchase and use, 
• the purchaser was well-situated to reduce the risk of harm, 
• the physician did not function in a typical intermediary 
capacity. 
3 That Taylor noted the general applicability of the LID is 
unremarkable. Application of the LID as a general matter is not at 
issue here. Taylor is instructive as to when the phrase "with the 
product" should be interpreted in accordance with its plain 
meaning and require warnings to a purchaser to supplement those 
to the doctor. 
15 

--- Page 23 ---
See 187 Wn.2d at 755-58. The Court emphasized the LID should 
not foreclose additional required warnings where supplemental 
warnings facilitate public safety: 
Since the learned intermediary doctrine underscores the 
importance of patient safety, it would be illogical if the 
doctrine was used to excuse another avenue to achieve that 
goal. If patient safety is the goal, then it requires all hands 
on deck. 
187 Wn.2d at 759-60. Sec .. 030(1)(b) should be interpreted in 
accordance with its plain text, which requires warnings be 
provided "with the product." 
"Adequate warnings" m § .030(1 )(b) further informs 
legislative intent. It is sufficiently broad to encompass 
consideration of warnings' recipients, substance, and manner of 
delivery. "Adequate," undefined in § .030(1 )(b ), means "fully 
sufficient for a specified or implied requirement." Webster's 
Third New International Dictionary, 25 
(1993). 
Under 
§ .030(1)(b), the "specified requirement" is that warnings render 
the product "reasonably safe." The factfinder should be permitted 
to determine whether a product was unsafe because DTCM 
influenced a consumer's expectations and rendered physician 
warnings alone "inadequate." 
16 

--- Page 24 ---
RCW 7.72.030(3) provides an independent basis for 
determining product safety, stating "the trier of fact shall consider 
whether the product was unsafe to an extent beyond that which 
would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer." Under the 
LID, consumer expectations regarding a prescription drug's 
safety are presumed to be based on information from the 
physician. See Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 14. DTCM upsets this 
presumption by promoting a drug directly to consumers. In such 
circumstances, under § .030(3), the trier of fact should be 
permitted to consider whether the absence of direct warnings 
render the product unsafe "beyond that which would be 
contemplated by the ordinary consumer." 
Tabert explained that relative safety depends on what 
would be "contemplated by the ordinary consumer" who 
purchases a product "with the ordinary lmowledge common to the 
community as to its characteristics." Tabert, 86 Wn.2d at 150-51 
(citation omitted). DTCM alters the "ordinary lmowledge 
common to the community" regarding the drug's relative safety. 
This should be included in the factfinding calculus. 
17 

--- Page 25 ---
Teagle applied Tabert's "ordinary consumer" test in 
evaluating adequacy of warnings, and indicated that consumer 
expectations 
may 
depend 
on 
manufacturers' 
product 
representations. There, the plaintiff was injured when the 
defendant's product -
a "flowrater" -
exploded. The explosion 
occurred when pressure exceeded 50 pounds per square inch 
(PSI), yet the manufacturer represented the product could 
withstand 400 psi. The Court held the manufacturer's 
representations should be considered in determining consumer 
expectations: 
In terms of the reasonable expectations of the ordinary 
consumer, given the fact that this flowrater was rated at 440 
p.s.i., we believe reasonable persons could only conclude 
that this unguarded flowrater was not reasonably safe when 
it was sold without a warning. 
Teagle, 89 Wn.2d at 155-56; see also Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 402A cmt. c ("public policy demands that the burden of 
accidental injuries ... be placed upon those who market them"); 
Ayers v. Johnson & Johnson, 117 Wn.2d 747, 765-66, 818 P.2d 
1337 (1991) (representation that baby oil is "pure and gentle" 
contributed to consumer's misconception regarding risks, 
18 

--- Page 26 ---
permitting factfinder to conclude product was unsafe beyond 
expectations of ordinary consumer). 
DTCM ads "distort and inflate consumers' expectations." 
Frosch, at 12. Sec .030(3) should be read in accordance with its 
plain language to permit the factfinder to consider whether the 
marketing of a product, not accompanied by adequate warnings, 
rendered the product "unsafe beyond that which would be 
contemplated by the ordinary consumer." 
RCW 7. 72.050(1) permits consideration of evidence that 
a product violated administrative regulations. FDA regulations 
impose obligations on DTCM manufacturers to directly warn 
consumers. See 21 C.F.R. § 202. l(e) (2008). If the LID is applied 
here, it will squarely conflict with the clear language of§ .050(1). 
In sum, the WPLA plainly requires warnings be provided 
directly to consumers. Common law rules like the LID lacking a 
basis in the WPLA must be applied sparingly "lest we defeat the 
letter or policy of the WPLA," Ruiz-Guzman, 141 Wn.2d at 506. 
Applying the LID exception should require, at a minimum, that 
19 

--- Page 27 ---
its purposes are served; otherwise, it must yield to the 
unambiguous statutory text. 
2. 
The assumptions underlying the LID are absent 
in the DTCM context. 
Terhune described the conceptual underpinnings of 
Washington's LID: 
[T]he physician acts as a "learned intennediary" between 
the manufacturer or seller and the patient. It is his duty to 
inform himself of the qualities and characteristics of those 
products which he prescribes for or administers to or uses 
on his patients, and to exercise an independent judgment, 
taking into account his knowledge of the patient as well as 
the product. The patient is expected to and, it can be 
presumed, does place primary reliance upon that 
judgment. The physician decides what facts should be 
told to the patient. Thus, if the product is properly labeled 
and carries the necessary instructions and warnings to fully 
apprise the physician of the proper procedures for use and 
the dangers involved, the manufacturer may reasonably 
assume that the physician will exercise the informed 
judgment thereby gained in conjunction with his own 
independent learning, in the best interest of the patient. It 
has also been suggested that the rule is made necessary by 
the fact that it is ordinarily difficult for the manufacturer 
to communicate directly with the consumer. 
90 Wn.2d at 14 (brackets and emphasis added); see also Taylor, 
187 Wn.2d at 757-58 (recognizing Terhune as announcing the 
principles underlying the LID). From this, four basic assumptions 
of Washington's LID may be gleaned: 
1) physicians exercise "independent judgment," 
20 

--- Page 28 ---
2) patients place "primary reliance" on physicians, and 
3) the "physician decides what facts should be told the 
patient," 
4) it is "difficult for the manufacturer to communicate directly 
with the consumer." 
90 Wn.2d at 14. 
Regarding 1) & 2), patients' "primary reliance" on 
physicians 
and physicians' 
"independent judgment" 
are 
compromised by DTCM. It prompts consumers to request DTCM 
products, alters physicians' prescribing practices, and increases 
the prescribing of DTCM products. See Murray, at 521-22; 
Schwartz, at 88-90. The effect is to reduce consumers' reliance 
on physicians and alter the judgment of physicians that is 
presumed to be "independent." 
Assumptions 3) & 4) are patently absent in the DTCM 
context. Manufacturers offer "facts" to consumers, which doctors 
have no power to filter. And with the explosion ofDTCM, it is no 
longer "difficult for the manufacturer to communicate directly 
with the consumer." 90 Wn.2d at 14. 
21 

--- Page 29 ---
The assumptions on which Washington's LID is based are 
not present in the DTCM context. 
3. 
Recognizing the narrow limitation proposed here 
would be neither harmful to the public nor 
unduly burdensome for manufacturers. 
Lilly warns that limiting the LID as proposed here would 
result in "greater confusion, less precision, and ultimately greater 
risk to patients." Resp. Br. at 30. This Court in McKee expressed 
similar concerns. See 113 Wn.2d at 719. These concerns should 
not override the plain language of the WPLA. 
McKee assumed a world in which the predicates of the LID 
were present. See 113 Wn.2d at 711. DTCM manufacturers 
interject 
themselves 
into 
the 
physician-patient 
line 
of 
communication and promote product benefits; warnings are 
needed to clarify and supplement promotional information. 
Research demonstrates that consumers exposed to DTCM are far 
more likely to seek information about a product from sources 
other than the prescriber, most commonly the internet. See Plaza, 
at 429. When consumers are exposed to DTCM, it is not a matter 
of whether they will consume information outside the physician-
22 

--- Page 30 ---
patient relationship, but rather where the infonnation will come 
from and how educational and reliable it will be. 
Manufacturers already have a general duty to directly warn 
consumers -
the LID is itself an exception to this duty. Many 
products have complicated risks, including, for example, 
nonprescription drugs; the solution to the risk of potential 
confusion is not to relieve manufacturers of their obligation to 
warn. Rather, it is to require warnings be "adequate," or "fully 
sufficient for a specified requirement." Of course, consumers 
must still establish adequate warnings could have been provided. 
See RCW 7.72.030(1)(b). Additionally, plaintiffs must prove 
proximate cause, which in this context should require proof that 
the consumer relied upon DTCM. See Plaza, at 453-55. 
Changes in the pharmaceutical industry and information 
technology provide manufacturers with tools for crafting 
adequate warnings. As platforms like Google, Twitter and 
Facebook urge and facilitate a shift ofDTCM to social and digital 
media, see Schwartz, at 90, manufacturers can employ the 
interactive functions of those media to simplify and customize 
warnings. See Andrew Andrzejewski, Direct-to-Consumer Calls 
23 

--- Page 31 ---
to Action: Lowering the Volume of Claims and Disclosures in 
Prescription Drug Broadcast Advertisements, 84 BKNLR 571, 
589 & nn. 135 & 136 (2019) (citing FDA draft proposals 
recognizing internet resources for conveying risk information). 
Because DTCM products occupy only a tiny percentage of 
the prescription drug market, the limitation proposed here would 
affect only a small minority of products and should not be unduly 
burdensome. See GAO-21-380, at 11. And ultimately, whether a 
manufacturer assumes a duty to directly warn consumers is 
wholly within its power, as it decides whether to directly advertise 
to consumers. 
4. 
Lilly's selected authorities provide no basis for 
departing from the clear import of Washington 
law. 
This case should be resolved on the basis of Washington 
product liability law. Looking outside Washington has generally 
been seen as having marginal value because of the variations in 
substantive product liability law among jurisdictions. See, e.g., 
Ryder v. Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., 91 Wn.2d 111, 117-19, 587 
P.2d 160 (1978); Ayers, 117 Wn.2d at 763-64. 
24 

--- Page 32 ---
To the extent the Court is inclined to look elsewhere for 
guidance, the state of the law is far more diverse than Lilly 
suggests. See Resp. Br. at 1-4, 47-66 (declaring broad consensus 
among jurisdictions); but see Joshua E. Perry, et al., Trust in the 
Balance: Prescription Drug Risks, Patient Perspectives, and 
Legal (Re)considerations, 24 J. Health Care L. & Pol'y 27, 41 & 
n.59 (2021) (surveying research and cases that suggest that the 
extent of the LID's application and its exceptions is complicated 
and disputed); State ex rel. Johnson & Johnson Corp. v. Karl, 647 
S.E. 2d 899, 903-05 (W. Va. 2007) (collecting cases and 
concluding purported agreement regarding the LID is overstated). 
The majority of Lilly's cited cases merely acknowledge or 
adopt the LID, without addressing exceptions to the doctrine. See 
Resp. Br. at 4 7-66. Other cited cases suggesting broad support for 
the LID are outdated. Compare, e.g., Hill v. Squibb & Sons, E. R., 
592 P.2d 1383, 181 Mont. 199 (1979), with Stevens v. Novartis 
Pharm. Corp., 247 P.3d244, 257-60 & n.6, 358 Mont. 474 (Mont. 
2010) (noting LID and emerging exceptions, including DTCM). 
The New Jersey Supreme Court expressly adopted the 
DTCM exception. See Perez v. Wyeth Labs. Inc., 734 A.2d 1245, 
25 

--- Page 33 ---
1256-57, 161 N.J. 1 (N.J. 1999). The West Virginia Supreme 
Court rejected the LID altogether, based in part on the modem 
emergence of DTCM. See Karl, 647 S.E.2d at 907-14 4 In 
Massachusetts, the Court adopted the LID, but recognized an 
exception for oral contraceptives. See Cottam v. CVS Pharm., 764 
N.E.2d 814, 821 (Mass. 2002). In Rimbertv. Eli Lilly & Co., 577 
F. Supp.2d 1174, 1214, 1218 (D.N.M. 2008), a federal district 
court predicted that the New Mexico Supreme Court would not 
adopt the LID, largely due to the emergence of DTCM. The 
Supreme Court of Oklahoma adopted an exception to the LID 
where FDA regulations require direct warnings and warnings fail 
to adequately apprise consumers of drugs' inherent risks. See 
Edwards v. Basel Pharm., 933 P.2d 298, 303 (Okla. 1997). 
Some jurisdictions have adopted the Restatement (Third) of 
Torts § 6(d) (1998) as their versions of the LID. See, e.g., Watts 
v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 365 P.3d 944, 949, 239 Ariz. 19 (Ariz. 
2016); Larkin v. Pfizer, Inc., 153 SW.3d 758, 770 (Ky. 2004); 
Freeman v. Hoffman LaRoche, Inc., 618 N.W.2d 827, 842, 260 
4 West Virginia subsequently adopted the LID by statute. See 
WVC § 55-7-3. Since its enactment, the Court has not addressed 
the propriety of a DTCM exception. 
26 

--- Page 34 ---
Neb. 552 (Neb. 2000). Restatement (Third) incorporates a general 
exception to the LID, recognizing that direct warnings may be 
necessary where physicians' intermediary role is compromised. 
See § 6( d) (LID exception appropriate if "health-care providers 
will not be in a position to reduce the risks of harm in accordance 
with the instructions or warnings"); see also § 6( d) cmt. e (listing 
exceptions to the LID for DTCM or where regulatory agencies 
mandate direct warnings). 5 The Restatement leaves to 
"developing case law" when exceptions to the LID will be 
appropriate. See § 6( d) cmt. e. 
Washington product liability law is an intricate framework 
that reflects decades of common law jurisprudence and statutory 
law, and that framework provides ample guidance to resolve the 
issue presented here. The Court's analysis of the certified 
question is best grounded in Washington law. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
'The Third Restatement differs from Washington strict liability 
jurisprudence in that it has incorporated a negligence standard. 
See Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings, 165 Wn.2d 373, 384 n.5, 
198 P.3d 493 (2008). However, analysis regarding appropriate 
exceptions to the LID may be instructive here. 
27 

--- Page 35 ---
As DTCM grows and patients consume more information 
outside the context of the physician-patient relationship, 
administrative bodies, legislatures and courts must craft rules to 
address the emerging public policy issues this creates. FDA 
regulations alone have proven insufficient, and there is no 
indication manufacturers will police themselves. See Applequist, 
at 215 (noting Frosch Study's suggestions to manufacturers for 
improvement of ad quality "have not been heeded"). 
Tort law is well-situated to check the market forces that 
drive manufacturers' DTCM decisions and to address the harms 
DTCM inflicts. See Eastwoodv. Horse Harbor Foundation, Inc., 
170 Wn.2d 380, 407-08, 241 P.3d 1256 (2010) (Chambers, J., 
concurring) (recognizing the role of tort in vindicating social 
policy). Manufacturers already have a tort duty to directly warn 
consumers. The limitation here respects the text of the WPLA and 
serves the purposes of the LID. The Court should answer "no" to 
the certified question.

Marketing and Advertising of Pharmaceuticals 
11 /S/2018 
This report is a compendium of state laws and related resources describing or affecting the marketing and advertising of pharmaceuticals, Including 
disclosure of information relating to the practices. 
NOTE: Parts of the tables of enacted laws are an archive report, researched, pasted and updated as of 2010. Please note the dates related to legislation and st 
laws. 
Numerous states have attempted to legislate different aspects of DTCA, including advertising, marketing, and doctor detailing and counter-detailing. The tables 
below summarize measures that were enacted. Soaring drug costs have become a matter of concern for lawmakers and their constituents, especially those on fixe 
incomes. One question is just how much is advertising on television and in the popular press contributing to these increased costs. 
An early analysis provided by the managed care industry for 1999 to 2000 reported that prescriptions written for the top 50 most heavily advertised drugs rose 24.E 
percent, compared to 4.3 percent for all other drugs combined.1 With pressure to try to curb the increased costs of prescription medicine, lawmakers have taken a 
closer look at the implications of pricey advertisements on state-funded programs. At an estimated annual cost of $2.S billion, pharmaceutical advertising to consur 
made drug companies and their brand products household names, 
Legislative lawyers point out that it is nearly impossible for individual states to control national advertisements, now regulated by the Food and Drug Administratior 
But that did not prevent some states from seeking solutions. Back in 2001, 12 states considered bills regarding direct-to-consumer advertising, and at least one-We: 
Virginia-enacted a law that gives the director of the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency discretion to use "innovative strategies," such as requiring 
prescription drug manufacturers to show how much they're spending on advertising and what that adds to drug costs. 
However the director, Tom Susman, stated that West Virginia will most likely train a team of pharmacists to meet with and educate doctors about the fiscal impacts 
prescribing higher priced and advertised drugs. "The pharmaceutical industry [representatives] don't talk about costs," Susman stated, "We go in and educate [doct 
about less expensive and therapeutic equivalent drugs and then they can make decisions to use less costly generics." Susman added that physicians [who participa· 
Medicaid] have an incentive to prescribe less costly drugs. "With only so much money to go around and using less expensive drugs, we have more money to put int( 
paying the West Virginia physicians'." 
Enacted State Laws: 
As of December 2012, ten states: California (2004), Connecticut, Florida (2006) Maine (2003 2005 2007), Massachusetts (2008), Minnesota (1993), New 
Hampshire (2006), South Carolina (2006), Vermont (2QQL lQQZ, 2.Q.Qill, West Virginia (2001) and the District of Columbia (2003, 2008), have laws or resolutions 
affecting pharmaceutical marketing. A separate Texas law (2007) requires a state-sponsored public awareness campaign to educate consumers about marketing 
solicitations by email or Internet. Texas (2009} also has required a study regarding the confidentiality of prescription information records. The specific provisions dif 
among these states - refer to details in the charts below. Note that states such as Maine and Vermont each have two or more separate laws, enacted in different ye 
Measures that passed both legislative chambers in California and Colorado but were vetoed are not included in the tally above, 
As of late 201 o three states-Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Vermont-require drug companies to disclose payments to prescribers and make some of that data 
public. While each of these states takes a different approach to collecting and making the payment data available to the public (more on that here), information fror 
three have disclosed the dimensions and scope of marketing relationships. 
Recognizing the policy concern, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) issued a voluntary code of behavior for its member 
companies, effective July 2002 and updated as of 2013: 
• SEE: Code on Interactions With Health Care Professionals, at http://www.phrma.org/codes-and-guidelines/code-on-interactions-with-health-care-professional 
Federal Health Reform: Provision for "Sunshine Rule" Brings Disclosure by Drug and Device 
Manufactures 
The ACA includes a less-known provision (Section 6002), called the "National Physician Payment Transparency Program," or "OPENPAYMENTS."The CMS publish 
the final ru.J.e. on Feb. 8, which requires that manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, medical devices and supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Heal 
Insurance Program (CHIP) report payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, The final rule also requires manufacturers and group 
purchasing organizations (GPOs) to disclose physician ownership or investment interests. They must also disclose what they pay to doctors for purposes such as 
consulting or speaking on behalf of the manufacturer or a specific drug. See latest explanation and 2016 data here: https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/ 
CMS released the data on a public website beginning Sept. 30, 2014. 
Federal Analysis and Background 
In 2003, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (DIG) published the Compliance Program Guidance for PharmaceutiCi

many gifts, free samples, educational seminars, entertainment and consulting arrangements are practices that risk criminal liability under the federal anti-kickback 
statute (see 42 U S.C.A. 1320a-7b(bJ..'.'...Criminal penalties for acts involving Federal health care programs") whenever the intent of the activity is to increase business. 
time the activity provides a benefit to the physician with the intent to "induce or reward referrals" of federal health care business it violates the anti-kickback statute 
even if the activity has a legitimate purpose. (Updated 2018) 
In addition to the federal anti-kickback statute and the voluntary guidelines, many states also have their own anti-kickback statutes and many have Medicaid fraud 
statutes that include anti-kickback provisions. Some states also now require pharmaceutical companies to report annually the amount they spend on specified 
marketing activities. This survey includes statutes relating to gifts, samples, donations, bribes, and kickbacks by pharmaceutical companies or their representatives 
doctors. State anti-kickback laws and Medicaid fraud statutes are included where explicitly applicable,

GAO Report Improvements Needed in FDA's Oversight of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising (November 2006) 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for overseeing direct-to-consumer (OTC) advertising of prescription drugs. If FDA identifies a violation of law: 
regulations in a OTC advertising material, the agency may issue a regulatory letter asking the drug company to take specific actions. GAO was asked to discuss (1) 
trends in drug company spending on OTC advertising and other activities; (2) what is known about the relationship between OTC advertising and drug spending anc 
utilization; (3) the DTC advertising materials FDA reviews; (4) the number of regulatory letters that cited DTC materials and FDA's process for issuing those letters; ar 
(5) the effectiveness of these letters at limiting the dissemination of violative OTC advertising. GAO reviewed research literature, analyzed FDA's processes, and 
examined FDA documentation. http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0754.pdf 
Health Affairs- Forum on Prescription Drug Promotion. February 26, 2003- ABSTRACT: Spending on prescription drugs and promotion by the pharmaceutical industI 
grew substantially during the past ten years. Does the greater exposure offered by promotion fill a needed educational gap, or does it merely promote inapproprial 
use? This paper uses two recent studies to explore this question, presenting a framework in which the impact of promotion depends upon the level of evidence anc 
consensus on drug use .. The survey is accompanied by five perspectives debating the pros and cons of direct-to-consumer drug advertising. (Full report can be rea,

(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and 
(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with 
the seller.

Caveat: 
The Institute expresses no opinion as to whether the rules stated in this Section may not apply 
(I) to harm to persons other than users or consumers; 
(2) to the seller of a product expected to be processed or otherwise substantially chauged before it reaches the user or consumer; 
or 
(3) to the seller of a component part of a product to be assembled.

§ 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... 
Comment: 
a. This Section states a special rule applicable to sellers of products. The rule is one of strict liability, making the seller subject 
to liability to the user or consumer even though he has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product. The 
Section is inserted in the Chapter dealing with the negligence liability of suppliers of chattels, for convenience ofreference and 
comparison with other Sections dealing with negligence. The rule stated here is not exclusive, and does not preclude liability 
based upon the alternative ground of negligence of the seller, where such negligence can be proved. 
b. History. Since the early days of the common law those engaged in the business of selling food intended for human consumption 
have been held to a high degree of responsibility for their products. As long ago as 1266 there were enacted special criminal 
statutes imposing penalties upon victualers, vintners, brewers, butchers, cooks, and other persons who supplied "corrupt" food 
and drink. In the earlier part of this century this ancient attitude was reflected in a series of decisions in which the courts of a 
number of states sought to fmd some method of holding the seller of food liable to the ultimate consumer even though there 
was no showing of negligence on the part of the seller. These decisions represented a departure from, and an exception to, the 
general rule that a supplier of chattels was not liable to third persons in the absence of negligence or privily of contract. In 
the beginning, these decisions displayed considerable ingenuity in evolving more or less fictitious theories of liability to fit the 
case. The various devices included an agency of the intermediate dealer or another to purchase for the consumer, or to sell for 
the seller; a theoretical assignment of the seller's warranty to the intermediate dealer; a third party beneficiary contract; and an 
implied representation that the food was fit for consumption because it was placed on the market, as well as numerous others. In 
later years the courts have become more or less agreed upon the theory of a "wananty" from the seller to the consumer, either 
"running with the goods" by analogy to a covenant running with the land, or made directly to the consumer. Other decisions 
have indicated that the basis is merely one of strict liability in tort, which is not dependent upon either contract or negligence. 
Recent decisions, since 1950, have extended this special rule of strict liability beyond the seller of food for human consumption. 
The first extension was into the closely analogous cases of other products intended for intimate bodily use, where, for example, 
as in the case of cosmetics, the application to the body of the consumer is external rather than internal. Beginning in 1958 
with a Michigan case involving cinder building blocks, a number of recent decisions have discarded any limitation to intimate 
association with the body, and have extended the rule of strict liability to cover the sale of any product which, if it should prove 
to be defective, may be expected to cause physical harm to the consumer or his property. 
c. On whatever theory, the justification for the strict liability has been said to be that the seller, by marketing his product for 
use and consumption, has undertaken and assumed a special responsibility toward any member of the consuming public who 
may be injured by it; that the public has the right to and does expect, in the case of products which it needs and for which it is 
forced to rely upon the seller, that reputable sellers will stand behind their goods; that public policy demands that the burden 
of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them, and be treated as 
a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained; and that the consumer of such products is entitled to the 
maximum of protection at the hands of someone, and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products. 
d. The rule stated in this Section is not limited to the sale of food for human consumption, or other products for intimate bodily 
use, although it will obviously include them. It extends to any product sold in the condition, or substantially the same condition, 
in which it is expected to reach the ultimate user or consumer. Thus the rule stated applies to an automobile, a tire, an airplane, 
a grinding wheel, a water heater, a gas stove, a power tool, a riveting machine, a chair, and an insecticide. It applies also to 
products which, if they are defective, may be expected to and do cause only "physical harm" in the form of damage to the user's 
land or chattels, as in the case of animal food or a herbicide. 
e. Normally the rule stated in this Section will be applied to articles which already have undergone some processing before 
sale, since there is today little in the way of consumer products which will reach the consumer without such processing. The 
rule is not, however, so limited, and the supplier of poisonous mushrooms which are neither cooked, canned, packaged, nor 
otherwise treated is subject to the liability here stated.

§ 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... 
f Business of selling. The rule stated in this Section applies to any person engaged in the business of selling products for use 
or consumption. It therefore applies to any manufacturer of such a product, to any wholesale or retail dealer or distributor, and 
to the operator of a restaurant. It is not necessary that the seller be engaged solely in the business of selling such products. 
Thus the rule applies to the owner of a motion picture theatre who sells popcorn or ice cream, either for consumption on the 
premises or in packages to be taken home. 
The rule does not, however, apply to the occasional seller of food or other such products who is not engaged in that activity 
as a part of his business. Thus it does not apply to the housewife who, on one occasion, sells to her neighbor a jar of jam or a 
pound of sugar. Nor does it apply to the owner of an automobile who, on one occasion, sells it to his neighbor, or even sells 
it to a dealer in used cars, and this even though he is fully aware that the dealer plans to resell it. The basis for the rule is the 
ancient one of the special responsibility for the safety of the public undertaken by one who enters into the business of supplying 
human beings with products which may endanger the safety of their persons and property, and the forced reliance upon that 
undertaking on the part of those who purchase such goods. This basis is lacking in the case of the ordinary individual who 
makes the isolated sale, and he is not liable to a third person, or even to his buyer, in the absence of his negligence. An analogy 
may be found in the provision of the Uniform Sales Act,§ 15, which limits the implied warranty of merchantable quality to 
sellers who deal in such goods; and in the similar limitation of the Uniform Connnercial Code,§ 2-314, to a seller who is a 
merchant. This Section is also not intended to apply to sales of the stock of merchants out of the usual course of business, such 
as execution sales, bankruptcy sales, bulk sales, and the like. 
g. Defective condition. The rule stated in this Section applies only where the product is, at the time it leaves the seller's hands, 
in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him. The seller is not liable 
when he delivers the product in a safe condition, and subsequent mishandling or other causes make it harmful by the time it is 
consumed. The burden of proof that the product was in a defective condition at the time that it left the hands of the particular 
seller is upon the injured plaintiff; and unless evidence can be produced which will support the conclusion that it was then 
defective, the burden is not sustained. 
Safe condition at the time of delivery by the seller will, however, include proper packaging, necessary sterilization, and other 
precautions required to permit the product to remain safe for a normal length of time when handled in a normal manner. 
h. A product is not in a defective condition when it is safe for normal handling and consumption. If the injury results from 
abnormal handling, as where a bottled beverage is knocked against a radiator to remove the cap, or from abnormal preparation 
for use, as where too much salt is added to food, or from abnormal consumption, as where a child eats too much candy and 
is made ill, the seller is not liable. Where, however, he has reason to anticipate that danger may result from a particular use, 
as where a drug is sold which is safe only in limited doses, he may be required to give adequate warning of the danger (see 
Comment}), and a product sold without such warning is in a defective condition. 
The defective condition may arise not only from harmful ingredients, not characteristic of the product itself either as to presence 
or quantity, but also from foreign objects contained in the product, from decay or deterioration before sale, or from the way in 
which the product is prepared or packed. No reason is apparent for distinguishing between the product itself and the container 
in which it is supplied; and the two are purchased by the user or consumer as an integrated whole. Where the container is itself 
dangerous, the product is sold in a defective condition. Thus a carbonated beverage in a bottle which is so weak, or cracked, 
or jagged at the edges, or bottled under such excessive pressure that it may explode or otherwise cause harm to the person who 
handles it, is in a defective and dangerous condition. The container cannot logically be separated from the contents when the 
two are sold as a unit, and the liability stated in this Section arises not only when the consumer drinks the beverage and is 
poisoned by it, but also when he is injured by the bottle while he is handling it preparatory to consumption. 
i. Unreasonably dangeraus. The rule stated in this Section applies only where the defective condition of the product makes it 
tmreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Many products cannot possibly be made entirely safe for all consumption,

§ 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... 
and any food or drug necessarily involves some risk of harm, if only from over-consumption. Ordinary sugar is a deadly poison 
to diabetics, and castor oil found use under Mussolini as an instrument of torture. That is not what is meant by "unreasonably 
dangerous" in this Section. The article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by 
the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics. 
Good whiskey is not unreasonably dangerous merely because it will make some people drunk, and is especially dangerous 
to alcoholics; but bad whiskey, containing a dangerous amount of fuel oil, is unreasonably dangerous. Good tobacco is 
not unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harmful; but tobacco containing something like 
marijuana may be unreasonably dangerous. Good butter is not unreasonably dangerous merely because, if such be the case, it 
deposits cholesterol in the arteries and leads to heart attacks; but bad butter, contaminated with poisonous fish oil, is unreasonably 
dangerous. 
). Directions or warning. In order to prevent the product from being unreasonably dangerous, the seller may be required to give 
directions or warning, on the container, as to its use. The seller may reasonably assume that those with common allergies, as 
for example to eggs or strawberries, will be aware of them, and he is not required to warn against them. Where, however, the 
product contains an ingredient to which a substantial number of the population are allergic, and the ingredient is one whose 
danger is not generally known, or if known is one which the consumer would reasonably not expect to find in the product, the 
seller is required to give warning against it, ifhe has knowledge, or by the application ofreasonable, developed human skill and 
foresight should have knowledge, of the presence of the ingredient and the danger. Likewise in the case of poisonous drugs, or 
those unduly dangerous for other reasons, warning as to use may be required. 
But a seller is not required to warn with respect to products, or ingredients in them, which are only dangerous, or potentially 
so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long period of time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger, is generally 
known and recognized. Again the dangers of alcoholic beverages are an example, as are also those of foods containing such 
substances as saturated fats, which may over a period of time have a deleterious effect upon the human heart. 
Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, 
which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. 
k. Unavoidably unsafe products. There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of 
being made safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially common in the field of drugs. An outstanding example 
is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences 
when it is injected. Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine 
are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product, properly prepared, 
and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of 
many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or 
under the prescription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of 
lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of 
ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable 
risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning 
is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, 
merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known 
but apparently reasonable risk. 
/. User or consumer. In order for the rnle stated in this Section to apply, it is not necessruy that the ultimate user or consumer have 
acquired the product directly from the seller, although the rule applies equally ifhe does so. He may have acquired it through one 
or more intermediate dealers. It is not even necessary that the consumer have purchased the product at all. He may be a member 
of the family of the final purchaser, or his employee, or a guest at his table, or a mere donee from the purchaser. The liability 
stated is one in tort, and does not require any contractual relation, or privily of contract, between the plaintiff and the defendant.

"Consumers" include not only those who in fact consume the product, but also those who prepare it for consumption; and the 
housewife who contracts tularemia while cooking rabbits for her husband is included within the rule stated in this Section, as 
is also the husband who is opening a bottle of beer for his wife to drink. Consumption includes all ultimate uses for which 
the product is intended, and the customer in a beauty shop to whose hair a permanent wave solution is applied by the shop 
is a consumer. "User" includes those who are passively enjoying the benefit of the product, as in the case of passengers in 
automobiles or airplanes, as well as those who are utilizing it for the purpose of doing work upon it, as in the case ofan employee 
of the ultimate buyer who is making repairs upon the automobile which he has purchased. 
Illustration: 
1. A manufactures and packs a can of beans, which he sells to B, a wholesaler. B sells the beans to C, a jobber, 
who resells it to D, a retail grocer. E buys the can of beans from D, and gives it to F. F serves the beans at 
lunch to G, his guest. While eating the beans, G breaks a tooth, on a pebble of the size, shape, and color of a 
bean, which no reasonable inspection could possibly have discovered. There is satisfactory evidence that the 
pebble was in the can of beans when it was opened. Although there is no negligence on the part of A, B, C, or 
D, each of them is subject to liability to G. On the other hand E and F, who have not sold the beans, are not 
liable to Gin the absence of some negligence on their part. 
m. "Warranty." The liability stated in this Section does not rest upon negligence. It is strict liability, similar in its nature to that 
covered by Chapters 20 and 21. The basis ofliability is purely one of tort. 
A number of courts, seeking a theoretical basis for the liability, have resorted to a "warranty," either running with the goods 
sold, by analogy to covenants running with the land, or made directly to the consumer without contract. In some instances this 
theory has proved to be an unfortunate one. Although warranty was in its origin a matter of tort liability, and it is generally 
agreed that a tort action will still lie for its breach, it has become so identified in practice with a contract of sale between the 
plaintiff and the defendant that the warranty theory has become something of an obstacle to the recognition of the strict liability 
where there is no such contract. There is nothing in this Section which would prevent any court from treating the rule stated as 
a matter of"warranty" to the user or consumer. But if this is done, it should be recognized and understood that the "warranty" is 
a very different kind of warranty from those usually found in the sale of goods, and that it is not subject to the various contract 
rules which have grown up to surround such sales. 
The rule stated in this Section does not require any reliance on the part of tl1e consumer upon the reputation, skill, or judgment 
of the seller who is to be held liable, nor any representation or undertaking on the part of that seller. The seller is strictly liable 
although, as is frequently the case, the consumer does not even know who he is at the time of consumption. The rule stated 
in this Section is not governed by the provisions of the Uniform Sales Act, or those of the Uniform Commercial Code, as to 
warranties; and it is not affected by limitations on the scope and content of warranties, or by limitation to "buyer" and "seller" 
in those statutes. Nor is the consumer required to give notice to the seller of his injury within a reasonable time after it occurs, 
as is provided by the Uniform Act. The consumer's cause of action does not depend upon the validity of his contract with the 
person from whom he acquires the product, and it is not affected by any disclaimer or other agreement, whether it be between 
the seller and his immediate buyer, or attached to and accompanying the product into the consumer's hands. In short, "warranty"

must be given a new and different meaning if it is used in connection with this Section. It is much simpler to regard the liability 
here stated as merely one of strict liability in tort. 
n. Contributory negligence. Since the liability with which this Section deals is not based upon negligence of the seller, but is 
strict liability, the rule applied to strict liability cases (see § 524) applies. Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense 
when such negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect in the product, or to guard against the possibility of its 
existence. On the other hand the form of contributory negligence which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to 
encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section as in 
other cases of strict liability. If the user or consmner discovers the defect and is aware of the danger, and nevertheless proceeds 
unreasonably to make use of the product and is injured by it, he is baiTed from recove1y. 
Comment on Caveat: 
o. J,yuries to non-users and non-consumers. Thus far the courts, in applying the rule stated in this Section, have not gone beyond 
allowing recovery to users and consumers, as those terms are defined in Comment I, Casual bystanders, and others who may 
come in contact with the product, as in the case of employees of the retailer, or a passer-by injured by an exploding bottle, or 
a pedestrian hit by an automobile, have been denied recovery. There may be no essential reason why such plaintiffs should not 
be brought within the scope of the protection afforded, other than that they do not have the same reasons for expecting such 
protection as the consumer who buys a marketed product; but the social pressure which has been largely responsible for the 
development of the rule stated has been a consumers' pressure, and there is not the same demand for the protection of casual 
strangers. The Institute expresses neither approval nor disapproval of expansion of the rule to pe1mit recovery by such persons. 
p. Further processing or substantial change. Thus far the decisions applying the rule statedhavenot gone beyond products which 
are sold in the condition, or in substantially the same condition, in which they are expected to reach the hands of the ultimate 
user or consumer. In the absence of decisions providing a clue to the rules which are likely to develop, the Institute has refrained 
from taking any position as to the possible liability of the seller where the product is expected to, and does, undergo further 
processing or other substantial change after it leaves his hands and before it reaches those of the ultimate user or consumer. 
It seems reasonably clear that the mere fact that the product is to undergo processiug, or other substantial change, will not in 
all cases relieve the seller of liability under the rule stated in this Section. If, for example, raw coffee beans are sold to a buyer 
who roasts and packs them for sale to the ultimate consumer, it cannot be supposed that the seller will be relieved of all liability 
when the raw beans are contaminated with arsenic, or some other poison. Likewise the seller of an automobile with a defective 
steering gear which breaks and injures the driver, can scarcely expect to be relieved of the responsibility by reason of the fact 
that the car is sold to a dealer who is expected to "service" it, adjust the brakes, mount and inflate the tires, and the like, before 
it is ready for use. On the other hand, the manufacturer of pig iron, which is capable ofa wide variety ofuses, is not so likely to 
be held to strict liability when it turns out to be unsuitable for the child's tricycle into which it is finally made by a remote buyer. 
The question is essentially one of whether the responsibility for discovery and prevention of the dangerous defect is shifted to 
the intermediate party who is to make the changes. No doubt there will be some situations, and some defects, as to which the 
responsibility will be shifted, and others in which it will not. The existing decisions as yet throw no light upon the questions, 
and the Institute therefore expresses neither approval nor disapproval of the seller's strict liability in such a case. 
q. Component parts. The same problem arises in cases of the sale of a component part of a product to be assembled by another, 
as for example a tire to be placed on a new automobile, a brake cylinder for the same purpose, or an instrument for the panel of 
an airplane. Again the question arises, whether the responsibility is not shifted to the assembler. It is no doubt to be expected 
that where there is no change in the component part itself, but it is merely incorporated into something larger, the strict liability 
will be found to carry through to the ultimate user or consumer. But in the absence of a sufficient number of decisions on the 
matter to justify a conclusion, the Institute expresses no opinion on the matter.

Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary: 
(1) Product seller. "Product seller" means any person or entity that is engaged in the 
business of selling products, whether the sale is for resale, or for use or consumption. The term 
includes a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer of the relevant product. The term also 
includes a party who is in the business of leasing or bailing such products. The term "product 
seller" does not include: 
(a) A seller of real property, unless that person is engaged in the mass production and sale 
of standardized dwellings or is otherwise a product seller; 
(b) A provider of professional services who utilizes or sells products within the legally 
authorized scope of the professional practice of the provider; 
(c) A commercial seller of used products who resells a product after use by a consumer or 
other product user: PROVIDED, That when it is resold, the used product is in essentially the same 
condition as when it was acquired for resale; 
(d) A finance lessor who is not otherwise a product seller. A "finance lessor" is one who acts 
in a financial capacity, who is not a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer, and who leases 
a product without having a reasonable opportunity to inspect and discover defects in the product, 
under a lease arrangement in which the selection, possession, maintenance, and operation of the 
product are controlled by a person other than the lessor; and 
(e) A licensed pharmacist who dispenses a prescription product manufactured by a 
commercial manufacturer pursuant to a prescription issued by a licensed prescribing practitioner if 
the claim against the pharmacist is based upon strict liability in tort or the implied warranty 
provisions under the uniform commercial code, Title 62A RCW, and if the pharmacist complies with 
recordkeeping requirements pursuant to chapters 18.64, 69.41, and 69.50 RCW, and related 
administrative rules as provided in RCW 7.72.040. Nothing in this subsection (1 )(e) affects a 
pharmacist's liability under RCW 7.72.040(1 ). 
(2) Manufacturer. "Manufacturer" includes a product seller who designs, produces, makes, 
fabricates, constructs, or remanufactures the relevant product or component part of a product 
before its sale to a user or consumer. The term also includes a product seller or entity not otherwise 
a manufacturer that holds itself out as a manufacturer. 
A product seller acting primarily as a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer of a product may be a 
"manufacturer" but only to the extent that it designs, produces, makes, fabricates, constructs, or 
remanufactures the product for its sale. A product seller who performs minor assembly of a product 
in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer shall not be deemed a manufacturer. A 
product seller that did not participate in the design of a product and that constructed the product in 
accordance with the design specifications of the claimant or another product seller shall not be 
deemed a manufacturer for the purposes of RCW 7.72.030(1 )(a). 
(3) Product. "Product" means any object possessing intrinsic value, capable of delivery 
either as an assembled whole or as a component part or parts, and produced for introduction into 
trade or commerce. Human tissue and organs, including human blood and its components, are 
excluded from this term. 
The "relevant product" under this chapter is that product or its component part or parts, 
which gave rise to the product liability claim. 

--- Page 52 ---
(4) Product liability claim. "Product liability claim" includes any claim or action brought for 
harm caused by the manufacture, production, making, construction, fabrication, design, formula, 
preparation, assembly, installation, testing, warnings, instructions, marketing, packaging, storage or 
labeling of the relevant product. It includes, but is not limited to, any claim or action previously 
based on: Strict liability in tort; negligence; breach of express or implied warranty; breach of, or 
failure to, discharge a duty to warn or instruct, whether negligent or innocent; misrepresentation, 
concealment, or nondisclosure, whether negligent or innocent; or other claim or action previously 
based on any other substantive legal theory except fraud, intentionally caused harm or a claim or 
action under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. 
(5) Claimant. "Claimant" means a person or entity asserting a product liability claim, 
including a wrongful death action, and, if the claim is asserted through or on behalf of an estate, the 
term includes claimant's decedent. "Claimant" includes any person or entity that suffers harm. A 
claim may be asserted under this chapter even though the claimant did not buy the product from, or 
enter into any contractual relationship with, the product seller. 
(6) Harm. "Harm" includes any damages recognized by the courts of this state: PROVIDED, 
That the term "harm" does not include direct or consequential economic loss under Title 62A RCW. 
[ 1991 C 189 § 3; 1981 C 27 § 2.] 
NOTES: 
Preamble-1981 c 27: "Tort reform in this state has for the most part been 
accomplished in the courts on a case-by-case basis. While this process has resulted in significant 
progress and the harshness of many common law doctrines has to some extent been ameliorated 
by decisional law, the legislature has from time to time felt it necessary to intervene to bring about 
needed reforms such as those contained in the 1973 comparative negligence act. 
The purpose of this amendatory act is to enact further reforms in the tort law to create a 
fairer and more equitable distribution of liability among parties at fault. 
Of particular concern is the area of tort law known as product liability law. Sharply rising 
premiums for product liability insurance have increased the cost of consumer and industrial goods. 
These increases in premiums have resulted in disincentives to industrial innovation and the 
development of new products. High product liability premiums may encourage product sellers and 
manufacturers to go without liability insurance or pass the high cost of insurance on to the 
consuming public in general. 
It is the intent of the legislature to treat the consuming public, the product seller, the 
product manufacturer, and the product liability insurer in a balanced fashion in order to deal with 
these problems. 
It is the intent of the legislature that the right of the consumer to recover for injuries 
sustained as a result of an unsafe product not be unduly impaired. It is further the intent of the 
legislature that retail businesses located primarily in the state of Washington be protected from the 
substantially increasing product liability insurance costs and unwarranted exposure to product 
liability litigation." [ 1981 c 27 § 1.]

Liability of manufacturer. 
(1) A product manufacturer is subject to liability to a claimant if the claimant's harm was 
proximately caused by the negligence of the manufacturer in that the product was not reasonably 
safe as designed or not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not 
provided. 
(a) A product is not reasonably safe as designed, if, at the time of manufacture, the 
likelihood that the product would cause the claimant's harm or similar harms, and the seriousness 
of those harms, outweighed the burden on the manufacturer to design a product that would have 
prevented those harms and the adverse effect that an alternative design that was practical and 
feasible would have on the usefulness of the product: PROVIDED, That a firearm or ammunition 
shall not be deemed defective in design on the basis that the benefits of the product do not 
outweigh the risk of injury posed by its potential to cause serious injury, damage, or death when 
discharged. 
(b) A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not 
provided with the product, if, at the time of manufacture, the likelihood that the product would cause 
the claimant's harm or similar harms, and the seriousness of those harms, rendered the warnings 
or instructions of the manufacturer inadequate and the manufacturer could have provided the 
warnings or instructions which the claimant alleges would have been adequate. 
(c) A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not 
provided after the product was manufactured where a manufacturer learned or where a reasonably 
prudent manufacturer should have learned about a danger connected with the product after it was 
manufactured. In such a case, the manufacturer is under a duty to act with regard to issuing 
warnings or instructions concerning the danger in the manner that a reasonably prudent 
manufacturer would act in the same or similar circumstances. This duty is satisfied if the 
manufacturer exercises reasonable care to inform product users. 
(2) A product manufacturer is subject to strict liability to a claimant if the claimant's harm 
was proximately caused by the fact that the product was not reasonably safe in construction or not 
reasonably safe because it did not conform to the manufacturer's express warranty or to the implied 
warranties under Title 62A RCW. 
(a) A product is not reasonably safe in construction if, when the product left the control of 
the manufacturer, the product deviated in some material way from the design specifications or 
performance standards of the manufacturer, or deviated in some material way from otherwise 
identical units of the same product line. 
{b) A product does not conform to the express warranty of the manufacturer if it is made part 
of the basis of the bargain and relates to a material fact or facts concerning the product and the 
express warranty proved to be untrue. 
(c) Whether or not a product conforms to an implied warranty created under Title 62A RCW 
shall be determined under that title. 
(3) In determining whether a product was not reasonably safe under this section, the trier of 
fact shall consider whether the product was unsafe to an extent beyond that which would be 
contemplated by the ordinary consumer.

21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements. 
Effective: February 19, 2008 
Currentness 
(a)(!) The ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shall appear together, 
without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except the proprietary names of ingredients, which may be included 
with the listing of established names. 
(2) The order of listing of ingredients in the advertisement shall be the same as the order of listing of ingredients on the 
label of the product, and the information presented in the advertisement concerning the quantity of each such ingredient 
shall be the same as the corresponding information on the label of the product. 
(3) The advertisement shall not employ a fanciful proprietary name for the drug or any ingredient in such a manner as to 
imply that the drug or ingredient has some unique effectiveness or composition, when, in fact, the drug or ingredient is a 
common substance, the limitations of which are readily recognized when the dmg or ingredient is listed by its established 
name. 
(4) The advertisement shall not feature inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater 
than their true functional role in the formulation. 
(5) The advertisement shall not designate a drug or ingredient by a proprietary name that, because of similarity in spelling 
or pronunciation, may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient. 
(b )(1) If an advertisement for a prescription drug bears a proprietary name or designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, 
the established name, if such there be, corresponding to such proprietary name or designation shall accompany such proprietary 
name or designation each time it is featured in the advertisement for the drug; but, except as provided below in this subparagraph, 
the established name need not be used with the proprietary name or designation in the running text of the advertisement. On 
any page of an advertisement in which the proprietary name or designation is not featured but is used in the rmrning text, the 
established name shall be used at least once in the rmming text in association with such proprietary name or designation and 
in the same type size used in the rmrning text: Provided, however, That if the proprietary name or designation is used in the 
running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in association with, and in type at least half as 
large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name or designation in such running text. If any 
advertisement includes a column with running text containing detailed information as to composition, prescribing, side effects, 
or contraindications and the proprietary name or designation is used in such column but is not featured above or below the

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
column, the established name shall be used at least once in such column of running text in association with such proprietary 
name or designation and in the same type size used in such column of running text: Provided, however, That if the proprietary 
name or designation is used in such coluum of running text in larger size type, the established name shall be used at least once in 
association with, and in type at least half as large as the type used for, the most prominent presentation of the proprietary name 
or designation in such coluum of running text. Where the established name is required to accompany or to be used in association 
with the proprietary name or designation, the established name shall be placed in direct conjunction with the proprietary name 
or designation, and the relationship between the proprietary name or designation and the established name shall be made clear 
by use of a phrase such as "brand of'' preceding the established name, by brackets surrounding the established name, or by 
other suitable means. 
(2) The established name shall be printed in letters that are at least half as large as the letters comprising the proprietary 
name or designation with which it is joined, and the established name shall have a prominence commensurate with the 
prominence with which such proprietary name or designation appears, taking into account all pertinent factors, including 
typography, layou~ contrast, and other printing features. 
( c) In the case of a prescription drug containing two or more active ingredients, if the advertisement bears a proprietary name 
or designation for such mixture and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, 
the quantitative ingredient infonnation required in the advertisement by section 502(n) of the act shall be placed in direct 
conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or designation. The prominence of the quantitative 
ingredient information shall bear a reasonable relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name. 
( d)(l) If the advertisement employs one proprietary name or designation to refer to a combination of active ingredients present 
in more than one preparation (the individual preparations differing from each other as to quantities of active ingredients and/or 
the form of the fmished preparation) and there is no established name corresponding to such proprietary name or designation, 
a listing showing the established names of the active ingredients shall be placed in direct conjnnction with the most prominent 
display of such proprietary name or designation. The prominence of this listing of active ingredients shall bear a reasonable 
relationship to the prominence of the proprietary name and the relationship between such proprietary name or designation, and 
the listing of active ingredients shall be made clear by use of such phrase as "brand of', preceding the listing of active ingredients. 
(2) The advertisement shall prominently display the name ofat least one specific dosage form and shall have the quantitative 
ingredient information required by section 502(n) of the act in direct conjunction with such display. If other dosage 
forms are listed in the advertisement, the quantitative ingredient information for such dosage forms shall appear in direct 
conjunction and in equal prominence with the most prominent listing of the names of such dosage forms. 
( e) True statement of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness: 
(1) When required. All advertisements for any prescription drug ("prescription drug" as used in this section means drugs 
defined in section 503(b )(1) of the act and§ 201.105, applicable to drugs for use by man and veterinary drugs, respectively), 
except advertisements described in paragraph ( e )(2) of this section, shall present a true statement of information in brief 
sununary relating to side effects, contraindications (when used in this section "side effects, contraindications" include 
side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such information under such headings as 
cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.) and effectiveness. Advertisements broadcast through media such 
as radio, television, or telephone communications systems shall include information relating to the major side effects and 
contraindications of the advertised drugs in the audio or audio and visual parts of the presentation and unless adequate

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
provision is made for dissemination of the approved or permitted package labeling in cormection with the broadcast 
presentation shall contain a brief summary of all necessary information related to side effects and contraindications. 
(2) Exempt advertisements. The following advertisements are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (e)(l) of this 
section under the conditions specified: 
(i) Reminder advertisements. Reminder advertisements are those which call attention to the name of the drug product 
but do not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product. These reminder advertisements 
shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; 
the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative 
ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, 
or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or suggestion relating to the advertised 
drug product. If the Commissioner fmds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fatalities or serious injury 
associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, 
packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder advertisements, other than those solely intended to convey price 
information including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of§ 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted 
for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use 
of the drug product. Reminder advertisements which are intended to provide consumers with information concerning the 
price charged for a prescription for a drug product are exempt from the requirements of this section if they meet all of the 
conditions contained in§ 200.200 of this chapter. Reminder advertisements, other than those subject to the requirements of 
§ 200 .200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a drug for which an armouncement has been published pursuantto a review 
on the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug 
Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than "possibly effective." If the Commissioner 
finds the circumstances are such that a reminder advertisement may be misleading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/ 
NRC evaluation, such advertisements will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either 
in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter. 
(ii) Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs. Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs that promote sale of the drug in bulk packages 
in accordance with the practice of the trade solely to be processed, manufactured, labeled, or repackaged in substantial 
quantities and that contain no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug. 
(iii) Advertisements of prescription-compounding chugs. Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs that promote 
sale of a drug for use as a prescription chemical or other compound for use by registered pharmacists in compounding 
prescriptions if the drug otherwise complies with the conditions for the labeling exemption contained in § 201.120 and the 
advertisement contains no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug. 
(3) Scope of information to be included; applicability to the entire advertisement. 
(i) The requirement of a true statement of information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness applies 
to the entire advertisement. Untrne or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by 
the inclusion in another distinct part of the advertisement of a brief statement containing true information relating to 
side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness of the drug. If any part or theme of the advertisement would make the 
advertisement false or misleading by reason of the omission of appropriate qualification or pertinent information, that part 
or theme shall include the appropriate qualification or pertinent information, which may be concise if it is supplemented

by a prominent reference on each page to the presence and location elsewhere in the advertisement of a more complete 
discussion of such qualification or information. 
(ii) The information relating to effectiveness is not required to include information relating to all purposes for which 
the drug is intended but may optionally be limited to a true statement of the effectiveness of the drug for the selected 
purpose(s) for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement. The information relating to effectiveness 
shall include specific indications for use of the drug for purposes claimed in the advertisement; for example, when an 
advertisement contains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent, the advertisement shall name a type or types of 
infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required, approved, or pennitted 
in the drug package labeling. 
(iii) The infonnation relating to side effects and contraindications shall disclose each specific side effect and 
contraindication (which include side effects, warnings, precautions, and contraindications and include any such infonnation 
under such headings as cautions, special considerations, important notes, etc.; see paragraph ( e)(l) of this section) contained 
in required, approved, or permitted labeling for the advertised drug dosage form(s): Provided, however, 
(a) The side effects and contraindications disclosed may be limited to those pertinent to the indications for which the 
drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement to the extent that such limited disclosure has previously been 
approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of§§ 201.100 or 201.105; and 
(b) The use of a single term for a group of side effects and contraindications (for example, "blood dyscrasias" for 
disclosure of "leukopenia," "agranulocytosis," and "neutropenia") is permitted only to the extent that the use of such 
a single term in place of disclosure of each specific side effect and contraindication has been previously approved or 
permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of§§ 201.100 or 201.105. 
(4) Substance of information to be included in brief summary. 
(i)(a) An advertisement for a prescription drug covered by a new-drug application approved pursuant to section 505 of 
the act after October 10, 1962, or a prescription mug covered by a new animal drug application approved pursuant to 
section 512 of the act after August I, 1969, or any approved supplement thereto, or for a prescription drug listed in the 
index pursuant to section 572 of the act, or any granted modification thereto, shall not recommend or suggest any use 
that is not in the labeling accepted in such approved new-drug application or supplement, new animal drug application or 
supplement, or new animal drug index listing or modification. The advertisement shall present information from labeling 
required, approved, permitted, or granted in a new-drug or new animal drug application or new animal drug index listing 
relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug 
dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. 
(b) If a prescription drug was covered by a new-drug application or a supplement thereto that became effective prior 
to October I 0, 1962, an advertisement may recommend or suggest: 
(I) Uses contained in the labeling accepted in such new-drug application and any effective, approved, or 
permitted supplement thereto.

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
(2) Additional uses contained in labeling in commercial use on October 9, 1962, to the extent that such uses 
did not cause the drug to be an unapproved "new drug" as "new drug" was defined in section 20l(p) of the act 
as then in force, and to the extent that such uses would be permitted were the drug subject to paragraph (e)(4) 
(iii) of this section. 
(3) Additional uses contained in labeling in current commercial use to the extent that such uses do not cause the 
drug to be an unapproved "new drug" as defined in section 20l(p) of the act as amended or a "new animal drug" 
as defined in section 201(v) of the act as amended. 
The advertisement shall present information from labeling required, approved, or permitted in a new-drug application 
relating to each specific side effect and contraindication in such labeling that relates to the uses of the advertised drug 
dosage form(s) or shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. 
(ii) In the case of an advertisement for a prescription drug other than a drug the labeling of which causes it to be 
an unapproved "new drug" and other than drugs covered by paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, an advertisement may 
recommend and suggest the drug only for those uses contained in the labeling thereof: 
(a) For which the drug is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and 
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of such drugs; or 
(b) For which there exists substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness, consisting of adequate and well-controlled 
investigations, including clinical investigations (as used in this section "clinical investigations," "clinical experience," 
and '"clinical significance" mean in the case of drugs intended for administration to man, investigations, experience, 
or significance in humans, and in the case of drugs intended for administration to other animals, investigations, 
experience, or significance in the specie or species for which the drug is advertised), by experts qualified by scientific 
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it can 
fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or 
(c) For which there exists substantial clinical experience (as used in this section this means substantial clinical 
experience adequately documented in medical literature or by other data (to be supplied to the Food and Drug 
Administration, ifrequested)), on the basis of which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts 
that the drug is safe and effective for such uses; or 
(d) For which safety is supported under any of the preceding clauses in paragraphs (e)(4)(iii)(a), (b), and (c) of this 
section and effectiveness is supported under any other of such clauses. 
The advertisement shall present information relating to each specific side effect and conn·aindication that is required, 
approved, or permitted in the package labeling by§§ 201.100 or 201.105 of this chapter of the drug dosage forrn(s) or 
shall otherwise conform to the provisions of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. 
(5) "True statement" of information. An advertisement does not satisfy the requirement that it present a "true statemenf' 
of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness if:

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
(i) It is false or misleading with respect to side effects, contraindications, or effectiveness; or 
(ii) It fails to present a fair balance between information relating to side effects and contraindications and information 
relating to effectiveness of the drug in that the information relating to effectiveness is presented in greater scope, depth, or 
detail than is required by section 502(n) of the act and this information is not fairly balanced by a presentation ofa summary 
of true information relating to side effects and contraindications of the drug; Provided, however, That no advertisement 
shall be considered to be in violation of this section if the presentation of true information relating to side effects and 
contraindications is comparable in depth and detail with the claims for effectiveness or safety. 
(iii) It fails to reveal facts material in the light of its representations or material with respect to consequences that may 
result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the advertisement. 
(6) Advertisements that are false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading. An advertisement for a prescription 
drug is false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act, among 
other reasons, if it: 
(i) Contains a representation or suggestion, not approved or permitted for use in the labeling, that a drug is better, more 
effective, useful in a broader range of conditions or patients (as used in this section patients means humans and in the case 
of veterinary drugs, other animals), safer, has fewer, or less incidence of, or less serious side effects or contraindications 
than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience (as described in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) 
(b) and (c) of this section) whether ornot such representations are made by comparison with other drugs or treatments, and 
whether or not such a representation or suggestion is made directly or through use of published or unpublished literature, 
quotations, or other references. 
(ii) Contains a drug comparison that represents or suggests that a drug is safer or more effective than another drug in some 
particular when it has not been demonstrated to be safer or more effective in such par1icular by substantial evidence or 
substantial clinical experience. 
(iii) Contains favorable information or opinions about a drug previously regarded as valid but which have been 
rendered invalid by contrary and more credible recent information, or contains literature references or quotations that 
are significantly more favorable to the drug than has been demonstrated by substantial evidence or substantial clinical 
experience. 
(iv) Contains a representation or suggestion that a drug is safer than it has been demonstrated to be by substantial evidence 
or substantial clinical experience, by selective presentation of information from published articles or other references that 
report no side effects or minimal side effects with the drug or otherwise selects information from any source in a way that 
makes a drug appear to be safer than has been demonstrated. 
(v) Presents information from a study in a way that implies that the study represents larger or more general experience 
with the drug than it actually does.

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
(vi) Contains references to literature or studies that misrepresent the effectiveness of a drug by failure to disclose that 
claimed results may be due to concomitant therapy, or by failure to disclose the credible information available concerning 
the extent to which claimed results may be due to placebo effect (information concerning placebo effect is not required 
unless the advertisement promotes the drug for use by man). 
(vii) Contains favorable data or conclusions from nonclinical studies of a drug, such as in laboratory animals or in vitro, 
in a way that suggests they have clinical significance when in fact no such clinical significance has been demonstrated. 
(viii) Uses a statement by a recognized authority that is apparently favorable about a drug but fails to refer to concurrent 
or more recent unfavorable data or statements from the same authority on the same subject or subjects. 
(ix) Uses a quote or paraphrase out of context to convey a false or misleading idea. 
(x) Uses literature, quotations, or references that purport to support an advertising claim but in fact do not support the 
claim or have relevance to the claim. 
(xi) Uses literature, quotations, or references for the purpose of recommending or suggesting conditions of drug use that 
are not approved or permitted in the drug package labeling. 
(xii) Offers a combination of drugs for the treatment of patients suffering from a condition amenable to treatment by any 
of the components rather than limiting the indications for use to patients for whom concomitant therapy as provided by 
the fixed combination drug is indicated, unless such condition is included in the uses permitted under paragraph (e)(4) 
of this section. 
(xiii) Uses a study on normal individuals without disclosing that the subjects were normal, unless the drug is intended for 
use on normal individuals. 
(xiv) Uses "statistics" on numbers of patients, or counts of favorable results or side effects, derived from pooling data from 
various insignificant or dissimilar studies in a way that suggests either that such "statistics" are valid if they are not or that 
they are derived from large or significant studies supporting favorable conclusions when such is not the case. 
(xv) Uses erroneously a statistical finding of "no significant difference" to claim clinical equivalence or to deny or conceal 
the potential existence of a real clinical difference. 
(xvi) Uses statements or representations that a drug differs from or does not contain a named drug or category of drugs, 
or that it has a greater potency per unit of weight, in a way that suggests falsely or misleadingly or without substantial 
evidence or substantial clinical experience that the advertised drug is safer or more effective than such other drug or drugs. 
(xvii) Uses data favorable to a drug derived from patients treated with dosages different from those recommended in 
approved or permitted labeling if the drug advertised is subject to section 505 of the act, or, in the case of other drugs, 
if the dosages employed were different from those recommended in the labeling and generally recognized as safe and

effective. This provision is not intended to prevent citation of reports of studies that include some patients treated with 
dosages different from those authorized, if the results in such patients are not used. 
(xviii) Uses headline, subheadline, or pictorial or other graphic matter in a way that is misleading. 
(xix) Represents or suggests that drug dosages properly recommended for use in the treatment of ce1tain classes of patients 
or disease conditions are safe and effective for the treatment of other classes of patients or disease conditions when such 
is not the case. 
(xx) Presents required information relating to side effects or contraindications by means of a general term for a group in 
place of disclosing each specific side effect and contraindication (for example employs the term blood dyscrasias instead 
of "leukopenia," "agranulocytosis," "neutropenia," etc.) unless the use of such general term conforms to the provisions 
of paragraph ( e )(3)(iii) of this section. 
Provided, however, That any provision of this paragraph shall be waived with respect to a specified advertisement as set 
forth in a written communication from the Food and Drug Administration on a petition for such a waiver from a person 
who would be adversely affected by the enforcement of such provision on the basis of a showing that the advertisement is 
not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act. A petition for 
such a waiver shall set forth clearly and concisely the petitioner's interest in the advertisement, the specific provision of 
this paragraph from which a waiver is sought, a complete copy of the advertisement, and a showing that the advertisement 
is not false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading, or otherwise violative of section 502(11) of the act. 
(7) Advertisements that may be false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading. An advertisement may be false, 
lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading or otherwise violative of section 502(n) of the act if it: 
(i) Contains favorable information or conclusions from a study that is inadequate in design, scope, or conduct to furnish 
significant support for such information or conclusions. 
(ii) Uses the concept of "statistical significance" to support a claim that has not been demonstrated to have clinical 
significance or validity, or fails to reveal the range of variations around the quoted average results. 
(iii) Uses statistical analyses and techniques on a retrospective basis to discover and cite findings not soundly supported by 
the study, or to suggest scientific validity and rigor for data from studies the design or protocol of which are not amenable 
to formal statistical evaluations. 
(iv) Uses tables or graphs to distort or misrepresentthe relationships, trends, differences, or changes among the variables or 
products studied; for example, by failing to label abscissa and ordinate so that the graph creates a misleading impression. 
(v) Uses reports or statements represented to be statistical analyses, interpretations, or evaluations that are inconsistent with 
or violate the established principles of statistical theory, methodology, applied practice, and inference, or that are derived 
from clinical studies the design, data, or conduct of which substantially invalidate the application of statistical analyses, 
interpretations, or evaluations.

§ 202.1 Prescription-drug advertisements., 21 C.F.R. § 202.1 
(vi) Contains claims concerning the mechanism or site of chug action that are not generally regarded as established by 
scientific evidence by experts qualified by scientific training and experience without disclosing that the claims are not 
established and the limitations of the supporting evidence. 
(vii) Fails to provide sufficient emphasis for the information relating to side effects and contraindications, when such 
information is contained in a distinct part of an advertisement, because of repetition or other emphasis in that part of the 
advertisement of claims for effectiveness or safety of the chug. 
(viii) Fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably 
comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug, talcing into account all implementing 
factors such as typography, layout, contrast, headlines, paragraphing, white space, and any other techniques apt to achieve 
emphasis. 
(ix) Fails to provide adequate emphasis (for example, by the use of color scheme, borders, headlines, or copy that extends 
across the gutter) for the fact that two facing pages are part of the same advertisement when one page contains information 
relating to side effects and contraindications. 
(x) In an advertisement promoting use of the chug in a selected class of patients (for example, geriatric patients or depressed 
patients), fails to present with adequate emphasis the significant side effects and contraindications or the significant dosage 
considerations, when dosage recommendations are included in an advertisement, especially applicable to that selected 
class of patients. 
(xi) Fails to present on a page facing another page ( or on another full page) of an advertisement on more than one page, 
infmmation relating to side effects and contraindications when such information is in a distinct par1 of the advertisement. 
(xii) Fails to include on each page or spread of an advertisement the infonnation relating to side effects and 
contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location when it is presented as a distinct part of an 
advertisement. 
(xiii) Contains information from published or unpublished reports or opinions falsely or misleadingly represented or 
suggested to be authentic or authoritative.

(ii) The Commissioner ( or in his absence the officer acting as Commissioner), after evaluating the reliability of such 
information, has notified the sponsor that the information must be a part of the advertisements for the drug; and 
(iii) The sponsor has failed within a reasonable time as specified in such notification to present to the Food and Drug 
Administration a program, adequate in light of the nature of the information, for assuring that such information will be 
publicized promptly and adequately to the medical profession in subsequent advertisements. 
If the Commissioner finds that the program presented is not being followed, he will notify the sponsor that prior approval 
of all advertisements for the particular drug will be required. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as limiting the 
Commissioner's or the Secretary's rights, as authorized by law, to issue publicity, to suspend any new-drug application, to 
decertify any antibiotic, or to recommend any regulatory action. 
(2) Within a reasonable time after information concerning the possibility that a drug may cause fatalities or serious damage 
has been widely publicized in medical literature, the Food and Drug Administration shall notify the sponsor of the drug 
by mail that prior approval of advertisements for the drug is no longer necessary. 
(3) Dissemination of an advertisement not in compliance with this paragraph shall be deemed to be an act that causes the

(4) Any advertisement may be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration prior to publication for comment. If the 
advertiser is notified that the submitted advertisement is not in violation and, at some subsequent time, the Food and Drug 
Administration changes its opinion, the advertiser will be so notified and will be given a reasonable time for correction 
before any regulatory action is taken under this section. Notification to the advertiser that a proposed advertisement is or 
is not considered to be in violation shall be in written form. 
( 5) The sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to 
part 16 of this chapter with respect to any determination that prior approval is required for advertisements concerning a 
particular prescription drug, or that a particular advertisement is not approvable. 
(k) An advertisement issued or caused to be issued by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug promoted by the

§ 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm 
Caused by Defective Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices 
Case Citations - by Jurisdiction 
(a) A manufacturer of a prescription drug or medical device who sells or otherwise distributes a defective drug or 
medical device is subject to liability for harm to persons caused by the defect. A prescription drug or medical device 
is one that may be legally sold or otherwise distributed only pursuant to a health-care provider's prescription. 
(b) For purposes of liability under Subsection (a), a prescription drug or medical device is defective if at the time 
of sale or other distribution the drug or medical device: 
(1) contains a manufacturing defect as defined in§ 2(a); or 
(2) is not reasonably safe due to defective design as defined in Subsection (c); or 
(3) is not reasonably safe due to inadequate instructions or warnings as defined in Subsection (d). 
(c) A prescription drug or medical device is not reasonably safe due to defective design if the foreseeable risks of 
harm posed by the drug or medical device are sufficiently great in relation to its foreseeable therapeutic benefits that 
reasonable health-care providers, knowing of such foreseeable risks and therapeutic benefits, would not prescribe 
the drug or medical device for any class of patients. 
(d) A prescription drug or medical device is not reasonably safe due to inadequate instructions or warnings if 
reasonable instructions or warnings regarding foreseeable risks of harm are not provided to: 
(1) prescribing and other health-care providers who are in a position to reduce the risks of harm in 
accordance with the instructions or warnings; or 
(2) the patient when the manufacturer knows or has reason to know that health-care providers will not 
be in a position to reduce the risks of harm in accordance with the instructions or warnings. 
(e) A retail seller or other distributor of a prescription drug or medical device is subject to liability for harm caused 
by the drug or device if: 
(1) at the time of sale or other distribution the drug or medical device contains a manufacturing defect 
as defined in§ 2(a); or

Comment: 
(2) at or before the time of sale or other distribution of the drug or medical device the retail seller or 
other distributor fails to exercise reasonable care and such failure causes harm to persons. 
a. History. Subsections (b)(l) and (d)(l) state the traditional mies that dmg and medical-device manufacturers are liable only 
when their products contain manufacturing defects or are sold without adequate instructions and warnings to prescribing and 
other health-care providers. Until recently, courts refused to impose liability based on defective designs of drugs and medical 
devices sold only by prescription. However, consistent with recent trends in the case law, two limited exceptions from these 
traditional rules are generally recognized. Subsection ( d)(2) sets forth situations when a prescription-drug or medical-device 
manufacturer is required to warn the patient directly ofrisks associated with consumption or use of its product. And Subsection 
(c) imposes liability for a drug or medical device whose risks of harm so far outweigh its therapeutic benefits that reasonable, 
properly informed health-care providers would not prescribe it. 
b. Rationale. The obligation of a manufacturer to warn about risks attendant to the use of drugs and medical devices that may be 
sold only pursuant to a health-care provider's prescription traditionally has required warnings directed to health-care providers 
and not to patients. The rationale supporting this "learned intermediary" mle is that only health-care professionals are in a 
position to understand the significance of the risks involved and to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of a given 
form of prescription-based therapy. The duty then devolves on the health-care provider to supply to the patient such information 
as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances so that the patient can make an informed choice as to therapy. Subsection ( d) 
(I) retains the "learned intermediary" rule. However, in certain limited therapeutic relationships the physician or other health-
care provider has a much-diminished role as an evaluator or decisionmaker. In these instances it may be appropriate to impose 
on the manufacturer the duty to warn the patient directly. See Subsection ( d)(2). 
The traditional refusal by courts to impose tort liability for defective designs of prescription drugs and medical devices is based 
on the fact that a prescription dmg or medical device entails a unique set ofrisks and benefits. What may be harmful to one 
patient may be beneficial to another. Under Subsection (c) a drug is defectively designed only when it provides no net benefit 
to any class of patients. Courts have concluded that as long as a drug or medical device provides net benefits to some persons 
under some circumstances, the drug or device manufacturer should be required to instruct and warn health-care providers of 
the foreseeable risks and benefits. Courts have also recognized that the regulatory system governing prescription dmgs is a 
legitimate mechanism for setting the standards for drug design. In part, this deference reflects concerns over the possible negative 
effects of judicially imposed liability on the cost and availability of valuable medical technology. This deference also rests on 
two further assumptions: first, that prescribing health-care providers, when adequately informed by dmg manufacturers, are able 
to assure that the right drugs and medical devices reach the right patients; and second, that governmental regulatory agencies 
adequately review new prescription drugs and devices, keeping unreasonably dangerous designs off the market. 
Nevertheless, unqualified deference to these regulatory mechanisms is considered by a growing number of cmnts to be 
unjustified. An approved prescription dmg or medical device can present significant risks without corresponding advantages. 
At the same time, manufacturers must have ample discretion to develop useful dmgs and devices without subjecting their design 
decisions to the ordinary test applicable to products generally under § 2(b ). Accordingly, Subsection ( c) imposes a more rigorous 
test for defect than does § 2(b ), which does not apply to prescription drugs and medical devices. The requirement for establishing 
defective design of a prescription dmg or medical device under Subsection ( c) is that the drug or device have so little merit 
compared with its risks that reasonable health-care providers, possessing knowledge of risks that were known or reasonably 
should have been known, would not have prescribed the dmg or device for any class of patients. Thus, a prescription dmg 
or medical device that has usefulness to any class of patients is not defective in design even if it is harmful to other patients.

§ 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm ... , Restatement (Third) of ... 
Because of the special nature of prescription drugs and medical devices, the determination of whether such products are not 
reasonably safe is to be made under Subsections ( c) and ( d) rather than under §§ 2(b) and 2( c). 
The rules imposing liability on a manufacturer for inadequate warning or defective design of prescription drugs and medical 
devices assume that the federal regulatory standard has not preempted the imposition of tort liability under state law. When 
such preemption is found, liability carmot attach if the manufacturer has complied with the applicable federal standard. See 
§ 4, Comment e. 
The doctrine of preemption based on supremacy offederal law should be distinguished from the proposition that compliance with 
statutory and regulatory standards satisfies the state's requirement for product safety. Subsections ( c) and (d) recognize common-
law causes of action for defective drug design and for failure to provide reasonable instructions or warnings, even though 
the manufacturer complied with governmental standards. For the rules governing compliance with governmental standards 
generally, see § 4(b ). 
c. Manufacturers' liability for manufacturing defects. Limitations on the liability for prescription drug and medical-device 
designs do not support treating drug and medical-device manufacturers differently from commercial sellers of other products 
with respect to manufacturing defects. Courts have traditionally subjected manufacturers of prescription products to liability 
for harm caused by manufacturing defects. 
d. Manufacturers' liability for failure adequately to instruct or warn prescribing and other health-care praviders. Failure to 
instruct or warn is the major basis of liability for manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices. When prescribing 
health-care providers are adequately informed of the relevant benefits and risks associated with various prescription drugs and 
medical devices, they can reach appropriate decisions regarding which drug or device is best for specific patients. Sometimes 
a warning serves to inform health-care providers of unavoidable risks that inhere in the drug or medical device. By definition, 
such a warning would not aid the health-care provider in reducing the risk of injury to the patient by taking precautions in how 
the drug is administered or the medical device is used. However, warnings ofunavoidable risks allow the health-care provider, 
and thereby the patient, to make an informed choice whether to utilize the drug or medical device. Beyond informing prescribing 
health-care providers, a drug or device manufacturer may have a duty under the law of negligence to use reasonable measures 
to supply instructions or warnings to nonprescribing health-care providers who are in positions to act on such information so 
as to reduce or prevent injury to patients. 
e. Direct warnings to patients. Warnings and instructions with regard to drugs or medical devices that can be sold legally 
only pursuant to a prescription are, under the "learned intermediary" rule, directed to health-care providers. Subsection ( d)(2) 
recognizes that direct warnings and instructions to patients are warranted for dmgs that are dispensed or administered to patients 
without the personal intervention or evaluation of a health-care provider. An example is the administration of a vaccine in clinics 
where mass inoculations are performed. In many such programs, health-care providers are not in a position to evaluate the risks 
attendant upon use of the drug or device or to relate them to patients. When a manufacturer supplies prescription chugs for 
distribution to patients in this type of unsupervised envirornnent, if a direct warning to patients is feasible and can be effective, 
the law requires measures to that effect. 
Although the learned intermediary rule is generally accepted and a drug manufacturer fulfills its legal obligation to warn 
by providing adequate warnings to the health-care provider, arguments have been advanced that in two other areas courts 
should consider imposing tort liability on drug manufacturers that fail to provide direct warnings to consumers. In the first, 
governmental regulatory agencies have mandated that patients be info1med of risks attendant to the use of a drug. A noted 
example is the FDA requirement that birth control pills be sold to patients accompanied by a patient package insert. In the 
second, manufacturers have advertised a prescription drug and its indicated use in the mass media. Governmental regulations 
require that, when drugs are so advertised, they must be accompanied by appropriate information concerning risk so as to provide 
balanced advertising. The question in both instances is whether adequate warnings to the appropriate health-care provider should 
insulate the manufacturer from tort liability.

§ 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm ... , Restatement (Third) of ... 
Those who assert the need for adequate warnings directly to consumers contend that manufacturers that communicate directly 
with consumers should not escape liability simply because the decision to prescribe the drug was made by the health-care 
provider. Proponents of the learned intermediary rule argue that, notwithstanding direct communications to the consumer, drugs 
cannot be dispensed unless a health-care provider makes an individualized decision that a drug is appropriate for a particular 
patient, and that it is for the health-care provider to decide which risks are relevant to the particular patient. The Institute leaves 
to developing case law whether exceptions to the learned intermediary rule in these or other situations should be recognized. 
When the content of the warnings is mandated or approved by a governmental agency regulation and a court fmds that 
compliance with such regulation federally preempts tort liability, then no liability under this Section can attach. For the rules 
governing compliance with governmental standards generally, see § 4(b ). 
f Manufacturers' liability for defectively designed prescription drugs and medical devices. Subsection (c) reflects the judgment 
that, as long as a given drug or device provides net benefits for a class of patients, it should be available to them, accompanied 
by appropriate warnings and instructions. Learned intermediaries must generally be relied upon to see that the right drugs and 
devices reach the right patients. However, when a drug or device provides net benefits to no class of patients-when reasonable, 
informed health-care providers would not prescribe it to any class of patients-then the design of the product is defective and 
the manufacturer should be subject to liability for the harm caused. 
A prescription drug or device manufacturer defeats a plaintiffs design claim by establishing one or more contexts in which its 
product would be prescribed by reasonable, informed health-care providers. That some individual providers do, in fact, prescribe 
defendant's product does not in itself suffice to defeat the plaintiffs claim. Evidence regarding the actual conduct of health-care 
providers, while relevant and admissible, is not necessarily controlling. The issue is whether, objectively viewed, reasonable 
providers, knowing of the foreseeable risks and benefits of the drug or medical device, would prescribe it for any class of 
patients. Given this very demanding objective standard, liability is likely to be imposed only under unusual circumstances. The 
court has the responsibility to determine when the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence so that reasonable persons could 
conclude that plaintiff has met this demanding standard. 
Illustration: 
1. ABC Pharmaceuticals manufactures and distributes D, a prescription drug intended to prolong pregnancy 
and thus to reduce the risks associated with premature birth. Patricia, six months pregnant with a history of 
irregular heart beats, was given D during a hospital stay in connection with her pregnancy. As a result, she 
suffered heart failure and required openMheart surge1y. In Patricia's action against ABC, her expert testifies that, 
notwithstanding FDA ap_proval of D five years prior to Patricia's taking the drug, credible studies P\lblished 
two years prior to Patricia's taking the drug concluded that D does not prolong pregnancy for any class of 
patients. Notwithstanding a finding by the trier of fact that ABC gave adequate warnings to the prescribing 
physician regarding the serious risks of heart failure in patients with a history of irregular heait beats, the trier 
of fact can find that reasonably informed health-care providers would not prescribe D for any class of patients, 
thus rendering ABC subject to liability.

§ 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm ... , Restatement (Third) of ... 
g. Foreseeability of risks of harm in prescription drug and medical device cases. Duties concerning the design and marketing 
of prescription chugs and medical devices arise only with respect to risks of hann that are reasonably foreseeable at the time 
of sale. Imposing liability for unforeseeable risks can create inappropriate disincentives for the development of new drugs and 
therapeutic devices. Moreover, because actuaries cannot accurately assess unknown and unknowable risks, insuring against 
losses due to unknowable risks would be problematic. Drug and medical device manufacturers have the responsibility to perform 
reasonable testing prior to marketing a product and to discover risks and risk-avoidance measures that such testing would reveal. 
See § 2, Comments a and m. 
Illustrations: 
2. DEF Pharmaceuticals, Inc., manufactures and distributes prescription drugs. Seven years ago DEF, after 
years of research and testing, received permission from the FDA to market X, a drug prescribed for the 
treatment of low-grade infections. Three years later, Jim, age 12, began taking X on his physician's prescription 
for a recun-ing respiratory-tract infection. Jim took X for approximately one year. Two years after Jim had 
stopped taking X, medical research discovered that X causes loss of vision in adolescents. Prior to this 
discovery DEF had not warned ofthis risk. Jim has begun to manifest symptoms of the sort caused by the drug. 
No evidence suggests that DEF's testing ofX was substandard, or that any reasonable drug company should 
have discovered the side effects sooner than they were discovered. In a failure~to-warn action by Jim against 
DEF, the court should direct a verdict in favor of the defendant. 
3. The same facts as Illustration 2, except that two years before Jim began talcing X, medical researchers 
published a credible study in a leading medical journal concerning the possibility that a drug with toxicological 
effects very similar to X adversely affects vision in adolescents. After publication of the study suggesting a 
possible link between X and loss of vision in adolescents, DEF did not conduct further research or provide 
warnings to physicians of the risk of X causing loss of vision. Jim's expe1i witness testifies that a reasonable 
manufacturer would have tested further and that such testing would have revealed that X causes vision loss in 
time to have warned Jim's physician. In Jim's failure-to-warn action against DEF, the trial corn1 should submit 
the issue of DEF's failure to warn to the trier of fact on appropriate instructions. 
h. Liability of retail seller of prescription drugs and medical devices for defective designs and defects due to inadequate 
instructions or warnings. The rule governing most products imposes liability on wholesalers and retailers for selling a 
defectively designed product, or one without adequate instructions or warnings, even though they have exercised reasonable 
care in marketing the product. See § I, Comment e, and § 2, Comment o. Courts have refused to apply this general rule to 
nonmanufacturing retail sellers of prescription chugs and medical devices and, instead, have adopted the rule stated in Subsection 
( e ). That rule subjects retailers to liability only if the product contains a manufacturing defect or if the retailer fails to exercise 
reasonable care in connection with distribution of the drug or medical device. In so limiting the liability of intermediary parties, 
courts have held that they should be permitted to rely on the special expertise of manufacturers, prescribing and treating health-
care providers, and governmental regulatory agencies. They have also emphasized the needs of medical patients to have ready 
access to prescription drugs at reasonable prices.

4. ABC Pharmaceuticals manufactures and distributes a prescription dmg to reduce blood pressure. ABC 
supplies pharmacies with pamphlets explaining the risks and warning patients against drinking alcohol while 
taking the drug. ABC asks the pharmacies to give the pamphlets to patients when dispensing the drug. The 
P Pharmacy received the pamphlets but negligently failed to give them to patients. P is subject to liability to 
those patients suffering injury for whom the pamphlets would have been effective in avoiding risks of usage. 
Comment b. Rationale. Courts have advanced a number of reasons for exclusive reliance on the learned intermediary rule. See, 
e.g., West v. Searle & Co., 806 S.W.2d 608, 613-14 (Ark.1991) (provider is best assessor ofrelevant risks and benefits); Brown 
v. Superior Court, 751 P.2d 470, 478-79 (Cal.1988) (concern that increased liability would drive prices of drugs too high and 
make them less available); Lacy v. G.D. Searle & Co., 567 A.2d 398 (Del.1989); In re Certified Questions, 358 N.W.2d 873, 
883 (Mich.1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting) (in some cases, directly warning patient "could potentially cause undue interference 
with the doctor-patient relationship [and] cause patient confusion"); Niemiera v. Schneider, 555 A.2d 1112, 1118 n. 3 (N.J.1989) 
("The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates vaccine manufacturers .... The regulations are quite detailed in 
their setting of standards for safety, effectiveness and adequate labelling."); Gravis v. Parke-Davis & Co., 502 S.W.2d 863, 
870 (Tex.App.1973) ("[The] entire system of drug distribution in America is set up so as to place the responsibility ... upon 
professional people"). For a useful discussion of the rule and its underlying rationale, see T. Schwartz, Consumer-Directed 
Prescription Drug Advertising and the Learned Intermediary Rule, 46 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 829, 830-31 (1991). 
Comment c. Manufacturers' liability for manzifacturing de/eels.Prescription drug manufacturers are strictly liable for harm 
caused by manufacturing defects. See, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Kidd, 242 F.2d 592 (6th Cir.) (applying Tennessee law), cert. denied, 
355 U.S. 814, 78 S.Ct. 15, 2 L.Ed.2d 31 (1957); Abbott Labs. v. Lapp, 78 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.1935); Hruska v. Parke, Davis 
& Co., 6 F.2d 536 (8th Cir.1925); Randall v. Goodrich-Gamble Co., 70 N.W.2d 261 (Minn.1955). Comment k to§ 402A of 
the Restatement, Second, of Torts reflects this rule: "The seller of [prescription drugs], with the qualification that they are 
properly prepared and marketed, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use" (emphasis 
added). See generally Madden, Products Liability§ 23.3 (2d ed. 1988). Prescription drug retailers also are strictly liable for 
manufacturing defects. See, e.g., Tremblay v. Kimball, 77 A. 405 (Me.1910); Burgess v. Sims Drug Co., 86 N.W. 307 (Iowa 
1901). 
Comment d Manufacturers' liability for failure adequately to instruct or warn prescribing and other health-care providers. The 
traditional rule, often referred to as the "learned intermediary rule," holds that manufacturers of prescription drugs discharge their 
duty of care to patients by warning the health-care providers who prescribe and use the drugs to treat them. See, e.g., DeLuryea v. 
Winthrop Labs., 697 F.2d 222, 228-29 (8th Cir.1983); Werner v. Upjohn Co., 628 F.2d 848,858 (4th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 
U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 862, 66 L.Ed.2d 804 (1981); Lindsay v. Ortho Phann. Corp., 637 F.2d 87, 91 (2d Cir.1980) (applying New 
York law). Accord, Salmon v. Parke, Davis & Co., 520 F.2d 1359, 1362 (4th Cir.1975) ("A manufacturer of an ethical drug must 
exercise reasonable care ... to warn physicians effectively of the drug's inherent dangers."); Basko v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 416
