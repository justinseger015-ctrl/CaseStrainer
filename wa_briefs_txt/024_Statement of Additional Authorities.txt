GENE GONZALES and SUSAN
GONZALES, HORWATH FAMILY
TWO, LLC, and THE WASHINGTON
LANDLORD ASSOCIATION, Appellant,
v.
GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE and STATE
OF WASHINGTON, Respondent.
No. 55915-3-II

February 23, 2022
PUBLISHED OPINION
MAXA, J.
*1 MAXA, J. – Gene and Susan Gonzales, Horwath
Family Two, LLC, and the Washington Landlord Association
(collectively, the appellants) appeal the trial court's grant
of summary judgment in favor of Governor Jay Inslee
and the State (collectively, the State), dismissing their
declaratory judgment action challenging Governor Inslee's
proclamations ordering a temporary eviction moratorium
related to COVID-19.
In February 2020, Governor Inslee declared a state of
emergency in Washington because of COVID-19. In March
2020, he issued a proclamation placing a temporary
moratorium on most evictions. The moratorium was amended
and extended by several subsequent proclamations until the
last version expired on June 30, 2021. The governor then
issued an eviction bridge proclamation, which expired on
October 31, 2021.
Gonzales and Horwath provided rental housing in Lewis
County, and their tenants had not paid rent since the
governor's proclamation was issued. The appellants filed
this action in Lewis County, seeking a declaration that
the governor had no statutory authority to issue the
eviction moratorium and the moratorium violated several
constitutional provisions. The State then filed a motion to
transfer venue to Thurston County, which the Lewis County
trial court granted.
We hold that (1) this appeal is not moot because the
case presents issues of substantial public interest, (2)
the Lewis County trial court did nor err in transferring
venue to Thurston County, (3) the Governor had authority
to issue the proclamations under 
RCW 43.06.220(1)
(h), 
(4)
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) did not violate the
constitutional prohibition against the delegation of legislative
authority, (5) the proclamations did not violate the separation
of powers doctrine or deny access to the courts, (6) the
proclamations did not constitute a taking of the appellants’
property, and (7) the proclamations did not constitute an
unconstitutional impairment of the appellants’ contracts with
their tenants.
Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary
judgment in favor of the State.
FACTS
Background
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 29,
2020 Governor Inslee declared a state of emergency in
Washington. On March 18, 2020, the governor issued
Proclamation 20-19, 1  which prohibited certain activities
related to residential evictions under the authority of
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h). The effect was to put a temporary
moratorium on most residential evictions. The moratorium
aimed to protect those with the inability to pay rent from being
evicted from their homes in the midst of the pandemic. The
purpose of the moratorium was to prevent increasing risks to
life, health, and safety from the pandemic.
The governor issued subsequent proclamations that
extended the eviction moratorium several times and
provided much more detailed provisions: Proclamations
20-19.1 2 , 20-19.2 3 , 20-19.3 4 , 20-19.4 5 , and 20-19.5. 6
The final proclamation regarding the eviction moratorium,
Proclamation 20-19.6 7 , expired on June 30, 2021 and
was not renewed. These proclamations prohibited landlords
and related persons from engaging in a number of
activities regarding evictions, which essentially prevented
most evictions. One exception was if eviction was necessary
because the tenant was creating a “significant and immediate
risk to the health or safety of others.” Proclamation 20-19.1 at

3. An exception later was added for when the landlord planned
to personally occupy or sell the rented premises.
*2  The proclamations also prohibited landlords from
treating unpaid rent resulting from COVID-19 as an
enforceable debt, unless the landlord offered and the tenant
refused a reasonable repayment plan.
In April 2021, the legislature enacted Engrossed Second
Substitute Senate Bill (E2SSB) 5160. LAWS of 2021, ch.115.
Section 1 of E2SSB 5160 noted the governor's temporary
moratorium on evictions “to reduce housing instability and
enable tenants to stay in their homes.” LAWS of 2021,
ch. 115, sec. 1. E2SSB stated that the Governor's eviction
moratorium would end on June 30, 2021. 
RCW 59.18.630.
E2SSB 5160 provided a number of protections for tenants,
including that landlords must offer tenants a reasonable
schedule for repayment of unpaid rent accruing between
March 1, 2020 and six months after expiration of the eviction
moratorium. 
RCW 59.18.630. In addition, the legislation
provided for the development of court-based eviction pilot
programs to facilitate the resolution of nonpayment of rent
cases between landlords and tenants. LAWS OF 2021, ch.
115, sec. 7. E2SSB 5160 also allowed landlords to recover up
to $15,000 from the State in unpaid rent if the tenant voluntary
vacated a tenancy or if a tenant defaulted on a payment
plan. 
RCW 43.31.605 (1)(d)(i). And it was required that
landlords be given the opportunity to apply for certain rental
assistance programs. LAWS OF 2021, ch. 115, sec. 12.
On June 29, 2021, the governor issued Proclamation
21-09 8  as a temporary bridge between the expired eviction
moratorium and the implementation of E2SSB 5160. This
proclamation continued to prohibit evictions until certain
provisions of E2SSB 5160 were implemented. Proclamation
21-09 was extended once, Proclamation 21-09.1 9 , and
expired on October 31, 2021.
Lawsuit and Summary Judgment
Gonzales and Horwath provided rental housing in Lewis
County. Tenant X had been with the Gonzales’ since 2019.
Tenant X had not paid rent or utilities since June 2020. The
Gonzales’ asked tenant X if they planned to pay utilities and
tenant X reportedly responded with “[w]hy should I pay them
anything; they can't shut me off due to the Pandemic.” CP at
252.
Tenant Y rented with Horwath. Tenant Y had not paid rent
since February 2020 or utilities since March 2020. A rental
management company attempted to contact tenant Y about
finding a solution for paying and to inquire about tenant
Y's plans or ability to pay. Tenant Y did not respond to the
inquiries. No repayment plan was offered because tenant Y
would not respond to any communications.
In December 2020, Gonzales and Horwath, joined by
the Washington Landlord Association, filed a declaratory
judgment action in Lewis County against Governor Inslee and
the State. They sought an order declaring that the governor's
proclamations ordering an eviction moratorium were void
as being without statutory authority and unconstitutional
under various provisions, and an order declaring that the
proclamations had caused an unconstitutional taking without
compensation.
*3  The State filed a motion to change venue from Lewis
County to Thurston County. The Lewis County trial court
granted the motion under 
RCW 4.12.020(2) because the
case involved a lawsuit against a public officer for an act done
by the governor in virtue of his office.
Both parties subsequently filed summary judgment motions.
The parties submitted declarations supporting the facts stated
above. The trial court granted the State's motion on all claims
and denied the appellants’ motion.
The appellants appeal the trial court's summary judgment
order.
ANALYSIS
A. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD
Where the parties do not dispute the material facts of the
case, we will affirm a grant of summary judgment if the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Wash.
State Legislature v. Inslee, 198 Wn.2d 561, 569, 498 P.3d 496

Proclamation 20-19 and subsequent versions all contained
similar preamble language explaining the basis of the eviction
moratorium:
WHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to
cause a sustained global economic slowdown, which is
anticipated to cause an economic downturn throughout
Washington State with layoffs and reduced work hours for
a significant percentage of our workforce due to substantial
reductions in business activity. . . ; and
WHEREAS, many in our workforce expect to be
impacted by these layoffs and substantially reduced work
hours are anticipated to suffer economic hardship that
will disproportionately affect low and moderate income
workers resulting in lost wages and potentially the inability
to pay for basic household expenses, including rent; and
WHEREAS, the inability to pay rent by these members
of our workforce increases the likelihood of eviction from
their homes, increasing the life, health and safety risks to
a significant percentage of our people from the COVID-19
pandemic; and
....
WHEREAS, a temporary moratorium on evictions
throughout Washington State at this time will help reduce
economic hardship and related life, health, and safety risks
to those members of our workforce impacted by layoffs
and substantially reduced work hours or who are otherwise
unable to pay rent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Proclamation 20-19 at 1-2.
Proclamation 20-19.1 and subsequent versions added the
following to the preamble:
WHEREAS, tenants, residents, and renters who are
not materially affected by COVID-19 should and must
continue to pay rent, to avoid unnecessary and avoidable
economic hardship to landlords, property owners, and
property managers who are economically impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic;
....
WHEREAS, it is critical to protect tenants and residents of
traditional dwellings from homelessness. ... ;
....
WHEREAS, a temporary moratorium on evictions and
related actions will reduce housing instability, enable
residents to stay in their homes unless conducting essential
activities or employment in essential business services,
and promote public health and safety by reducing the
progression of COVID-19 in Washington State.
Proclamation 20-19.1 at 1-2.
Proclamation 20-19.4 added the following: “WHEREAS,
hundreds of thousands of tenants in Washington are
unable to pay their rent, reflecting the continued financial
precariousness of many in the state.” Proclamation 20-19.4
at 3. Proclamation 20-19.5 stated, “WHEREAS, as of
November 2020, current information suggests that at least
165,000 tenants in Washington will be unable to pay their
rent in the near future, reflecting the continued financial
precariousness of many in the state.” Proclamation 20-19.5
at 2. Proclamation 20-19.6 stated, “WHEREAS, as of March
2021, current information suggests that at least 76,000 tenants
in Washington will be unable to pay their rent in the near
future, reflecting the continued financial precariousness of
many in the state.” Proclamation 20-19.6 at 3.
2. Eviction Moratorium
*4  Proclamation 20-19 stated that landlords generally were
prohibited under 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) from engaging in
the following activities: (1) “serving a notice of unlawful
detainer for default payment of rent,” (2) “issuing a 20-
day notice for unlawful detainer,” and (3) “initiating judicial
action seeking a writ of restitution involving a dwelling unit
if the alleged basis for the writ is the failure of the tenant or
tenants to timely pay rent.” Proclamation 20-19 at 2-3.
Proclamation 20-19.1 adopted different and expanded
language, generally prohibiting, under 
RCW 43.06.220(1)
(h), landlords from engaging in a number of activities,
including: (1) “serving or enforcing, or threatening to serve
or enforce, any notice requiring a resident to vacate any
dwelling ... , including but not limited to an eviction notice,
notice to pay or vacate, notice of unlawful detainer, notice
of termination of rental, or notice to comply or vacate”; and
(2) “seeking or enforcing, or threatening to seek or enforce,
judicial eviction orders.” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 3-4. All the
subsequent proclamations contained these prohibitions.

Proclamation 
20-19.1 
and 
subsequent 
proclamations
contained an exception if the prohibited eviction activities
were “necessary to respond to a significant and immediate
risk to the health or safety of others created by the
resident.” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 3. Proclamation 20-19.2
and subsequent proclamations added an exception for when
the property owner planned to personally occupy or sell the
rental property. Proclamation 20-19.2 at 3.
Proclamation 20-19.1 also contained the following provision:
Except as provided in this paragraph,
landlords, 
property 
owners, 
and
property managers are prohibited from
treating any unpaid rent or other
charges related to a dwelling or parcel
of land occupied as a dwelling as
an enforceable debt or obligation that
is owing or collectable, where such
non-payment was as a result of the
COVID-19 outbreak and occurred on
or after February 29, 2020.
Proclamation 20-19.1 at 4. However, this prohibition
contained the following exception:
This prohibition does not apply to a
landlord, property owner, or property
manager who demonstrates by a
preponderance of the evidence to a
court that the resident was offered, and
refused or failed to comply with, a
re-payment plan that was reasonable
based on the individual financial,
health, and other circumstances of that
resident.
Proclamation 20-19.1 at 4 (emphasis omitted). All the
subsequent proclamations contained these provisions.
3. Conclusion Language
Proclamation 20-19.1 contained the following conclusion
language: “FURTHERMORE, it is the intent of this order to
prevent a potential new devastating impact of the COVID-19
outbreak – that is, a wave of statewide homelessness that will
impact every community in our state.” Proclamation 20-19.1
at 5 (emphasis omitted). All the subsequent proclamations
contained this provision.
Beginning with Proclamation 20-19.3 in July 2020, all the
proclamations contained the following provision:
MOREOVER, as Washington State
begins to emerge from the current
public health and economic crises,
I recognize that courts, tenants,
landlords, 
property 
owners, 
and
property 
managers 
may 
desire
additional direction concerning the
specific parameters for reasonable
repayment plans related to outstanding
rent or fees. This is best addressed
by legislation, and I invite the state
Legislature to produce legislation as
early as possible during their next
session to address this issue. I stand
ready to partner with our legislators
as necessary and appropriate to ensure
that the needed framework is passed
into law.
*5  Proclamation 20-19.3 at 7 (emphasis omitted).
C. MOOTNESS OF APPEAL
The State argues that the issue is moot because the
moratorium has expired. The appellants argue that even if the
case is moot, it should be resolved because there are matters
of substantial public interest. We agree with the appellants.
An appeal is moot if we no longer can provide effective relief.
Dzaman v. Gowman, 18 Wn. App. 2d 469, 476, 491 P.3d
1012 (2021). However, we may exercise our discretion to
review a moot appeal when it involves issues of continuing
and substantial public interest. Id. Three factors determine
whether we will exercise our discretion: “ ‘(1) the public or
private nature of the question presented, (2) the desirability
of an authoritative determination to provide future guidance
to public officers, and (3) the likelihood that the question will
recur.’ ” Id. (quoting Thomas v. Lehman, 138 Wn. App. 618,
622, 158 P.3d 86 (2007)).

5
These three factors support considering this appeal. At first
glance, this appeal appears to be moot because the eviction
moratorium expired in June 2021 and the bridge moratorium
expired in October 2021. But the COVID-19 pandemic is not
over. And because the pandemic persists, it is possible that the
governor may institute another, similar eviction moratorium
in the future. Therefore, this case presents issues of continuing
and substantial public interest.
D. CHANGE OF VENUE
The appellants argue that the Lewis County trial court
improperly transferred venue to Thurston County. We
disagree.
The venue of an action is determined by statute. Clark County
v. Portland Vancouver Junction R.R., LLC, 17 Wn. App. 2d
289, 292, 485 P.3d 985 (2021). When two different venue
statutes apply to a lawsuit, we will apply “ ‘mandatory statutes
to the exclusion of permissive ones and specific statutes to
the exclusion of general ones.’ ” Id. at 293 (quoting Ralph
v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 187 Wn.2d 326, 338, 386 P.3d 721
(2016)).
RCW 4.12.010(1) states that venue shall be in the county
where the subject of the action is located “for any injuries to
real property.” RCW 4.92.010 states that the venue of lawsuits
against the State shall be in one of several places, including
the county of the residence of one or more plaintiffs and “[t]he
county in which the real property that is the subject of the
action is situated.” The appellants rely on these statutes to
argue that venue was proper in Lewis County, where they
resided and where their rental properties were located.
However, 
RCW 4.12.020(2) states that for actions “against
a public officer ... for an act done by him or her in virtue of
his or her office,” venue shall be “in the county where the
cause of action, or some part thereof, arose.” The State relies
on this statute to argue that venue was proper only in Thurston
County, where the governor issued the proclamations.
The Supreme Court has stated that when 
RCW 4.12.020(2)
applies, “venue in the specified county is mandatory.”
Johnson v. Inslee, 198 Wn.2d 492, 496, 496 P.3d 1191
(2021). Therefore, the only question here is whether 
RCW
4.12.020(2) applies to this action.
*6  The Supreme Court's decision in Johnson resolves this
issue. In that case, a State employee filed a lawsuit against
Governor Inslee and other State entities in Franklin County,
challenging the governor's proclamation requiring all State
employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 198 Wn.2d
at 494-95.
Regarding where the cause of action arose, the court relied on
cases from other states to conclude that “it is the official act
itself – the act for which redress is sought – that ’gives rise’
to the cause of action, and thus venue is proper in the county
where the act is made.” Id. at 496-97. Therefore, the court held
that the cause of action regarding the governor's proclamation
arose only in Thurston County, where he performed the act
of issuing it. Id. at 498-99. The court stated, “To conclude
otherwise would mean a statewide public official such as the
governor could be haled into superior courts throughout the
state to defend similar suits challenging a single act having
statewide effect, as this case itself exemplifies.” Id. at 497.
Regarding the “in virtue of office” requirement, the court
stated, “[R]egardless of whether the governor exceeded his
constitutional authority, which has not yet been determined,
he plainly acted ‘in virtue of his ... office’ in issuing
emergency proclamations pursuant to his statutory authority
under 
RCW 43.06.220.” Id. at 498. The court concluded,
“The governor issued his proclamations ‘in virtue’ of his
‘office’ within the meaning of 
RCW 4.12.020(2).” Id.
Based on this analysis, the court held that Thurston County
was the mandatory venue for the action challenging the
governor's vaccine proclamation. Id. at 498-99.
The appellants argue that Johnson is distinguishable because
that case did not involve real property. They claim that
RCW 4.12.020(2) cannot trump RCW 4.12.010(1) and
RCW 4.92.010. But the court in Johnson expressly stated that
RCW 4.12.020(2) is mandatory if that statute applies. 198
Wn.2d at 496. Therefore, it does trump other venue statutes.
See Portland Vancouver Junction R.R, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 293.
The appellants also argue under 
RCW 4.12.020 that “some
part” of their cause of action arose in Lewis County because
their injuries occurred in Lewis County. But the same was
true in Johnson, and the court in that case rejected a similar
argument. 198 Wn.2d at 497 n.6. The court expressly held
that the “cause of action challenging the lawfulness of the

6
proclamations ‘arose’ only in Thurston County.” Id. at 498-99
(emphasis added).
We hold that the Lewis County trial court did not err in
transferring venue to Thurston County.
E. GOVERNOR'S AUTHORITY UNDER 
RCW
43.06.220(1)(H) TO ISSUE PROCLAMATIONS
Appellants argue that the governor did not have authority
under 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) to issue Proclamation 20-19
and the subsequent proclamations. We disagree.
1. Legal Principles
“The executive branch has historically led Washington's
response to emergencies.” 
Colvin v. Inslee, 195 Wn.2d
879, 895, 467 P.3d 953 (2020). RCW 43.06.010(12) states,
“The governor may, after finding that a public disorder,
disaster, energy emergency, or riot exists within this state
or any part thereof which affects life, health, property, or
the public peace, proclaim a state of emergency in the area
affected.” A declaration of a state of emergency activates
the governor's broad powers in emergencies. 
Colvin, 195
Wn.2d at 895. Various statutes “evidence a clear intent by the
legislature to delegate requisite police power to the governor
in times of emergency. The necessity for such delegation is
readily apparent.” 
Cougar Bus. Owners’ Assoc. v. State,
97 Wn.2d 466, 474, 647 P.2d 481 (1982), overruled in part
by Chong 
Yim v. City of Seattle, 194 Wn.2d 682, 451 P.3d
694 (2019).
*7
RCW 43.06.220(1) provides:
The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency and
prior to terminating such, may, in the area described by the
proclamation issue an order prohibiting:
....
(h) Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes
should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life,
health, property or the public peace.
(Emphasis added.)
RCW 
43.06.220(2) 
states, 
“The 
governor 
after
proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminating
such may, in the area described by the proclamation, issue an
order or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutory
obligations or limitations” in certain specified areas. A waiver
or suspension of statutory obligations or limitations under
subsection (2) may not continue for longer than 30 days unless
extended by the legislature. 
RCW 43.06.220(4).
We review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.
Wright v. Lyft, Inc., 189 Wn.2d 718, 722, 406 P.3d 1149
(2017). The goal in interpreting a statute is to determine and
give effect to the legislature's intent. Id. The court considers
the language of the statute, the context of the statute, related
statutes, and the statutory scheme as a whole. 
Gray v.
Suttell & Assocs., 181 Wn.2d 329, 339, 334 P.3d 14 (2014).
The interpretation ends if the plain language is unambiguous.
Jametsky v. Olsen, 179 Wn.2d 756, 762, 317 P.3d 1003
(2014). But if more than one reasonable interpretation exists,
the court will resolve it by turning to other sources of
legislative intent, including statutory construction, legislative
history, and case law. Id.
2. Analysis
Here, the plain language of 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) is
unambiguous. The governor may issue an order prohibiting
any activities the governor reasonably believes should be
prohibited “to help preserve and maintain life, health,
property or the public peace.” 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h). The
term “activities” is extremely broad, and is broad enough to
include the actions the proclamations prohibited regarding
evictions and unpaid rent. And the proclamation preambles
made it clear that the governor reasonably believed that
prohibiting those activities was necessary to preserve life,
health, and property.
The appellants argue that the proclamations suspended rights
and obligations established by various statutes, including
the obligation of tenants to pay rent and the right of
landlords to evict tenants who do not pay rent. They
emphasize that 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) does not authorize
the governor to suspend the operation of statutes. And they
claim that if 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) is interpreted to allow
the suspension of statutes, subsection (2) – which does

expressly authorize the suspension of statutory obligations or
limitations in certain areas – would be rendered superfluous.
However, none of the proclamations stated that the governor
was suspending any statutes. Tenants still were subject to the
statutory obligation to pay rent set forth in RCW 59.18.110;
they simply could not be evicted for failing to pay rent.
The moratorium may have delayed the ability of landlords
to exercise the statutory remedy of eviction stated in RCW
59.12.030 in many cases, but the operation of that statute
was not suspended. The wrongful detainer statute still could
be invoked if “necessary to respond to a significant and
immediate risk to the health and safety of others created by the
resident,” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 3, or if the property owner
planned to personally occupy or sell the rental property.
*8  Instead of suspending any statutes, the governor
prohibited 
certain 
specific 
activities, 
as 
RCW
43.06.220(1)(h) expressly authorized. Nothing in 
RCW
43.06.220(1)(h) suggests that the governor is not authorized
to prohibit activities that may involve statutory rights and
obligations.
We hold that 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) authorized the
governor to issue the proclamations providing for an eviction
moratorium. 10
F. DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY
Appellants argue that if 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) authorized
the issuance of an eviction moratorium, it violated
the constitutional prohibition of delegation of legislative
authority. We disagree.
Article 2, section 1 (amendment 72) of the Washington
Constitution states that “[t]he legislative authority of the state
of Washington shall be vested in the legislature.” As a result,
the legislature cannot delegate purely legislative functions to
other branches of government. Auto. 
United Trades Org.
v. State, 183 Wn.2d 842, 859, 357 P.3d 615 (2015). “These
nondelegable powers include the power to enact, suspend,
and repeal laws.” 
Diversified Inv. P'ship v. Dep't of Soc. &
Health Servs., 113 Wn.2d 19, 24, 775 P.2d 947 (1989).
As noted above, none of the proclamations stated that the
governor was suspending any statutes. And the proclamations
did not suspend the operation of any statutes. Instead, the
governor prohibited certain specific activities as 
RCW
43.06.220(1)(h) expressly authorized.
We hold that 
RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) did not violate
the constitutional prohibition of delegation of legislative
authority.
G. SEPARATION OF POWERS AND DENIAL OF
ACCESS TO COURTS
Appellants argue that the proclamations violated the
separation of powers doctrine and denied them access to the
courts for judicial relief. We disagree.
1. Separation of Powers
The Washington Constitution does not contain a formal
separation of powers clause, but “ ‘the very division of
our government into different branches has been presumed
throughout our state's history to give rise to a vital separation
of powers doctrine.’ ” 
Brown v. Owen, 165 Wn.2d 706,
718, 206 P.3d 310 (2009) (quoting 
Carrick v. Locke,
125 Wn.2d 129, 135, 882 P.2d 173 (1994)). The doctrine
ensures “that the fundamental functions of each branch
remain inviolate.” Hale v. Wellpinit Sch. Dist. No. 49, 165
Wn.2d 494, 504, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). A branch violates
the separation of powers doctrine when an action “threatens
the independence or integrity or invades the prerogatives of
another.” 
City of Fircrest v. Jensen, 158 Wn.2d 384, 394,
143 P.3d 776 (2006).
Here, the proclamations do not interfere with a court's
authority in any way. None of the proclamation provisions are
directed to the courts, and the proclamations do not purport
to prevent the courts from taking any actions. For example,
the proclamations do not prohibit courts from issuing eviction
orders or otherwise resolving disputes between landlords and
tenants. Instead, the proclamations’ prohibitions are directed
at landlords and related persons. Preventing a person from
requesting or enforcing eviction orders does not invade the
prerogatives of the judicial branch. Therefore, we hold that
the proclamations did not violate the separation of powers
doctrine.

a. Legal Principles
*9  “The people have a right of access to courts; indeed, it
is ‘the bedrock foundation upon which rest all the people's
rights and obligations.’ ” 
Putman v. Wenatchee Valley Med.
Ctr., P.S., 166 Wn.2d 974, 979, 216 P.3d 374 (2009) (quoting
John Doe v. Puget Sound Blood Ctr., 117 Wn.2d 772,
780, 819 P.2d 370 (1991)). The right of access to courts
derives in part from the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution and article I, section 4 of the Washington
Constitution. 
Leishman v. Ogden Murphy Wallace, PLLC,
196 Wn.2d 898, 914, 479 P.3d 688 (2021). There also is a
due process component. 
In re Marriage of Giordano, 57
Wn. App. 74, 77, 787 P.2d 51 (1990). The right of access
is implicated where there is a delay or total blockage of a
person's ability to file suit. Musso-Escude v. Edwards, 101
Wn. App. 560, 566, 4 P.3d 151 (2000).
However, “ ‘[t]here is no absolute and unlimited
constitutional right of access to courts. All that is required is
a reasonable right of access – a reasonable opportunity to be
heard.’ ” 
Giordano, 57 Wn. App. at 77 (quoting Ciccarelli
v. Carey Can. Mines, Ltd., 757 F.2d 548, 554 (3d Cir.1985)).
“[W]hen access to the courts is not essential to advance a
fundamental right ... access may be regulated if the regulation
rationally serves a legitimate end.” 
Giordano, 57 Wn. App.
at 77; see also 
Yurtis v. Phipps, 143 Wn. App. 680, 694,
181 P.3d 849 (2008). And access to the courts itself is not a
fundamental right. Ford Motor Co. v. Barrett, 115 Wn.2d 556,
562, 800 P.2d 367 (1990).
b. Analysis
Here, the governor's proclamations did not completely restrict
access to the courts. There were exceptions to the eviction
moratorium if the tenant created health and safety risks
to others, and if the property owner planned to personally
occupy or sell the rental property. Landlords could treat
unpaid rent as an enforceable obligation and could sue on
that obligation if the tenant refused or failed to comply with a
reasonable repayment plan. And a landlord's ability to bring
eviction proceedings only was delayed until the expiration of
the final proclamation, not extinguished completely.
Because the proclamations regulated but did not completely
deny access to the courts, we analyze the appellants’
access to courts claim under a rational basis approach. See
Giordano, 57 Wn. App. at 77. Under this approach,
the question is whether the eviction moratorium “rationally
serves a legitimate end.” Id.
The State's purpose in preventing the spread and transmission
of COVID-19 undoubtedly is significant and important. See,
e.g., 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo,
___ U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67, 208 L. Ed.2d 206
(2020) (stating that “[s]temming the spread of COVID-19
is unquestionably a compelling interest.”). So is preventing
widespread homelessness caused by economic distress
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, the eviction moratorium was a rational means
to achieve this important purpose. As the governor noted
in his proclamations, the COVID-19 pandemic was causing
adverse economic consequences for a large number of people,
potentially resulting in a widespread inability to pay rent
and evictions. Evictions would increase the health and safety
risks from the pandemic for people forced into homelessness.
Conversely, a moratorium on evictions would allow people to
stay in their homes, thereby promoting health and safety and
helping to prevent the progression of the pandemic.
*10  Several federal cases have rejected access to courts
challenges to restrictions on evictions related to COVID-19.
Heights Apts., LLC v. Walz, 510 F. Supp. 3d 789, 810-11
(D. Minn. 2020), appeal filed, No. 21-1278 (8th Cir. Feb.
5, 2021);

dismissed, 860 F. App'x 215 (2d Cir. 2021).
The appellants rely on a trial court decision from the District
of Columbia in which the court ruled that an eviction
moratorium violated the constitutional right to access using
an intermediate scrutiny analysis. However, the D.C. Court of
Appeals reversed this decision and held that the moratorium
did not violate the right to access. Dist. of Columbia v. Towers,
260 A.3d 690, 693-96 (D.C. App. 2021).
We hold that the eviction moratorium did not violate the
appellants’ right of access to the courts.

H. TAKING PROPERTY WITHOUT COMPENSATION
The appellants argue that the temporary eviction moratorium
constituted a per se physical taking of their property because
the moratorium deprived them of the right to evict tenants
from their property. We disagree. 11
1. Legal Principles
The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution
states that private property shall not be “taken for public
use, without just compensation.” Article I, section 16 of the
Washington Constitution provides, “No private property shall
be taken or damaged for public or private use without just
compensation having been first made.” Washington courts
generally apply the federal takings analysis. See Chong Yim,
194 Wn.2d at 658-59.
There are two general types of takings: (1) a physical taking,
where “the government authorizes a physical occupation of
property”; and (2) a regulatory taking, “where the government
merely regulates the use of property.” 
Yee v. City of
Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, 522 112 S. Ct. 1522, 118
L. Ed.2d 153 (1992). The first type is subject to a per se
rule: if a physical taking has occurred, the government must
pay compensation. 
Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, ___
U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 2063, 2071, 210 L. Ed. 2d 369 (2021).
“Whenever a regulation results in a physical appropriation
of property, a per se taking has occurred.” 
Id. at 2072. In
addition, “a physical appropriation is a taking whether it is
permanent or temporary.” 
Id. at 2074.
The second type of taking is analyzed using a flexible,
balancing test adopted in 
Penn Central Transportation Co.
v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed.
2d 631 (1978). 
Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S. Ct. at 2072.
The appellants allege only that the temporary eviction
moratorium constituted a physical, per se taking. They do not
argue that the moratorium was a regulatory taking under Penn
Central.
2. Analysis
*11  The appellants argue that the eviction moratorium
constituted a physical, per se taking because it required
them to allow tenants to reside in their property without the
payment of rent. Relying on Cedar Point Nursery, they claim
that precluding evictions essentially forced them to submit to
a physical occupation of their property.
This argument is inconsistent with the United States Supreme
Court's analysis in Yee. In that case, mobile park owners who
rented pads to the owners of mobile homes challenged a state
statute that among other things (1) limited their ability to
terminate a mobile home owner's tenancy, (2) did not allow
them to remove a mobile home if it was sold, and (3) required
them to continue renting to a mobile home purchaser as long
as the purchaser had the ability to pay rent. 
Yee, 503
U.S. at 524. The City of Escondido subsequently adopted
a rent control ordinance that dictated the rent the mobile
park owners could charge. 
Id. at 524-25. The mobile park
owners argued that the statute and ordinance resulted in a
physical, per se taking because they were precluded from fully
using and occupying their property. 
Id. at 525. Instead, the
right to physically occupy their property – at submarket rent
– essentially had been transferred indefinitely to the mobile
home owners and their successors. 
Id. at 527.
The Court stated that this argument was inconsistent with
the law of physical takings. Id. The court stated, “The
government effects a physical taking only where it requires
the landowner to submit to the physical occupation of his
land. ‘This element of required acquiescence is at the heart of
the concept of occupation.’ ” Id. (quoting 
FCC v. Florida
Power Corp., 480 U.S. 245, 252, 107 S. Ct. 1107, 1112, 94
L. Ed. 2d 282 (1987)). However, the Court emphasized that
the statute and the ordinance had not required the occupation
of the mobile park – the mobile park owners had voluntarily
rented their property to the mobile home owners. 
Yee, 503
U.S. at 527. “Put bluntly, no government has required any
physical invasion of petitioners’ property. Petitioners’ tenants
were invited by petitioners, not forced upon them by the
government.” 
Id. at 528.
The Court concluded:
On their face, the state and local laws at issue here
merely regulate petitioners’ use of their land by regulating
the relationship between landlord and tenant. “This
Court has consistently affirmed that States have broad
power to regulate housing conditions in general and the
landlord-tenant relationship in particular without paying

compensation for all economic injuries that such regulation
entails.”
Id. at 528-29 (quoting 
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan
CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 440, 102 S. Ct. 3164, 73 L. Ed.
2d 868 (1982)).
The appellants rely on Cedar Point Nursery. In that case,
a labor regulation required agricultural employers to permit
union organizers on their property for three hours a day, 120
days per year, for the purpose of soliciting employees to
join or form a union. 
Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S. Ct. at
2069. The court emphasized that the regulation allowed union
organizers to physically enter and occupy the property. 
Id.
at 2072. “The regulation appropriates a right to physically
invade the growers’ property – to literally ‘take access,’ as the
regulation provides.” 
Id. at 2074. Therefore, the court held
that the regulation was a per se physical taking. Id.
*12  This case is similar to Yee and is dissimilar to Cedar
Point Nursery. As in Yee, the eviction moratorium did not
require the appellants to submit to the physical occupation
of their property. Instead, the appellants were the ones who
invited their tenants to occupy their rental property. And
unlike in Cedar Point Nursery, the moratorium did not require
that the appellants allow third parties to enter and take
access to their property. The proclamations merely operated
to “regulate [appellants’] use of their land by regulating the
relationship between landlord and tenant.” 
Yee, 503 U.S.
at 528. Therefore, we conclude that the eviction moratorium
did not constitute a physical per se taking.
This conclusion is supported by federal courts in Washington
and in other jurisdictions that have ruled that eviction
moratoriums do not constitute an unconstitutional physical
taking without compensation. E.g., 
Jevons v. Inslee, 2021
WL 4443084, *11-15 (E.D. Wash. 2021), appeal filed, No.
22-35050 (9th Cir Jan. 18, 2022); El Papel, LLC v. Durkan,

F. Supp. 3d at 388; 
Auracle Homes, LLC v. Lamont, 478
F. Supp. 3d 199, 220-21 (D. Conn. 2020); 
Elmsford Apt.
Assocs., 469 F. Supp. 3d at 162-64.
We hold that the eviction moratorium did not constitute an
unconstitutional taking without compensation. 12
I. IMPAIRMENT OF CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP
The appellants argue that the temporary eviction moratorium
unconstitutionally impaired their contractual relationship
with their tenants. We disagree.
1. Legal Standard
Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution
states, “No State shall ... pass any ... law impairing
the obligation of contracts.” Article I, section 23 of the
Washington Constitution provides that “[n]o ... law impairing
the obligations of contracts shall ever be passed.” The
standards under the two provisions are the same. Lenander v.
Dept. of Ret. Sys., 186 Wn.2d 393, 414, 377 P.3d 199 (2016).
“[A] constitutional violation will be found only if the
challenged action substantially impairs an existing contract
and, even then, only if the action was not reasonable and
necessary to serve a legitimate public purpose.” Id. We apply
a three-part test: “(1) Does a contractual relationship exist;
(2) does the legislation substantially impair the relationship;
and (3) if there is a substantial impairment, is the impairment
reasonable and necessary to serve a legitimate public
purpose?” Id.
If the government is not one of the contracting parties, as
here, the court must “ ‘defer to legislative judgment as to
the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.’ ”
Energy Reserves Grp., Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co.,
459 U.S. 400, 413, 103 S. Ct. 697, 74 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1983)
(quoting 
United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S.
1, 22-23, 97 S. Ct. 1505, 52 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1977)).
Both parties discuss 
Home Building & Loan Association v.
Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 54 S. Ct. 231, 78 L. Ed. 413 (1934).
In that Great Depression-era case, the United States Supreme
Court upheld a mortgage moratorium law that, among other
things, extended mortgagors’ redemption period following
a foreclosure sale for up to two years. 
Id. at 416-18.
The Court stated that a law may not release or extinguish
contractual obligations without violating the contract clause.
Id. at 431. As a result, the contract clause may not be
interpreted to “permit the state to adopt as its policy the

11
repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the
denial of means to enforce them.” 
Id. at 439. However,
the Court stated that the constitutional prohibition against the
impairment of contracts should be not be construed to prevent
“limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the
enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public
calamity,” including urgent public need related to economic
causes. Id. (emphasis added).
*13  Regarding the statute at issue, the Court noted that
the mortgage debt was not impaired, the validity of the
foreclosure sale and the mortgagee's ability to obtain a
deficiency judgment were not affected, and the mortgagor
was required to pay the rental value of the home during
the extended possession. 
Id. at 445. “The mortgagee-
purchaser during the time that he cannot obtain possession
thus is not left without compensation for the withholding of
possession.” Id. Therefore, the Court held that the statute did
not violate the contracts clause. 
Id. at 447.
2. Analysis
a. Substantial Impairment
To determine whether there is a substantial impairment of
a contractual relationship, we consider “the extent to which
the law undermines the contractual bargain, interferes with a
party's reasonable expectations, and prevents the party from
safeguarding or reinstating his rights.” 
Sveen v. Melin,
___ U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 1815, 1822, 201 L. Ed. 2d 180
(2018). All three considerations support the conclusion that
the eviction moratorium does not substantially impair the
appellants’ contracts with their tenants.
First, the eviction moratorium did not undermine landlords’
contractual bargain. The moratorium did not extinguish the
contractual obligations of tenants to pay rent. Instead, the
moratorium temporarily delayed landlords’ ability to exercise
the remedy of eviction for nonpayment of rent.
The appellants claim that the moratorium imposed a
permanent prohibition against landlords treating any unpaid
rent as an enforceable debt. However, this claim is inaccurate.
The proclamations state that unpaid rent would not be an
enforceable debt only if (1) nonpayment occurred after
February 29, 2020, (2) “non-payment was as a result of the
COVID-19 outbreak,” and (3) the landlord failed to offer the
tenant a reasonable repayment plan. Proclamation 20-19.1 at
4. Assuming a landlord offered a reasonable repayment plan,
all unpaid rent would be an enforceable debt.
The appellants argue that allowing landlords to treat unpaid
rent as an enforceable debt only if they offer a reasonable
payment plan was illusory for landlords, like Horwath,
whose tenants refused to communicate with them. They
emphasize that the repayment plan condition required that
the offered plan be “reasonable based on the individual
financial, health, and other circumstances of that resident.”
Proclamation 20-19.1 at 4. According to the appellants, it
would be impossible for landlords to offer the required
repayment plan if they had no information regarding their
tenants’ “financial, health, and other circumstances” and no
way of forcing tenants to provide such information.
However, a trial court assessing whether a prepayment plan
was reasonable undoubtedly would base its assessment on
the information available to the landlord. For example, the
landlord could make assumptions based on the financial
information about the tenants obtained at the inception of the
lease. A trial court would not penalize a landlord by rendering
unpaid rent an unenforceable debt when the landlord made
a good faith effort to design a reasonable repayment plan
despite the tenant's failure to cooperate.
Second, the moratorium did not completely interfere with
landlords’ reasonable expectations. There is no question that
the rental housing industry generally has been regulated
heavily, such as in the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act,
chapter 59.18 RCW, and the forcible entry and unlawful
detainer statute, chapter 59.12 RCW. This pervasive
regulation put landlords on notice that the government might
intervene further in the landlord-tenant relationship.
*14  Third, the eviction moratorium gave landlords the
ability to safeguard and reinstate their rights. The moratorium
was temporary, and following its expiration landlords
retained all available remedies for nonpayment of rent. The
moratorium merely delayed the exercise of those remedies.
And as noted above, even during the moratorium landlords
could treat unpaid rent as an enforceable obligation if they
offered tenants a reasonable repayment plan.
Federal courts in Washington and in other jurisdictions have
ruled that eviction moratoriums do not substantially impair
contractual relationships between landlords and tenants. E.g.,
Jevons, 2021 WL 4443084, at *8-9; 
Heights Apts., 510

F. Supp. 3d at 808-09; 
Auracle Homes, 478 F. Supp. 3d at
224-25; 
Elmsford Apt. Assocs., 469 F. Supp. 3d at 171-72.
We conclude that the eviction moratorium did not
substantially impair the appellants’ rental contracts.
b. Reasonable and Necessary Means
Even if we were to assume that the eviction moratorium
substantially impaired the appellants’ contractual relationship
with their tenants, the moratorium did not violate the contracts
clause because it was “reasonable and necessary to serve a
legitimate public purpose.” Lenander, 186 Wn.2d at 414.
The appellants do not dispute that the eviction moratorium
served a legitimate public purpose: to prevent widespread
homelessness and the further spread of COVID-19. They
argue only that the moratorium did not advance this purpose
in an appropriate and reasonable manner. And they focus
only on the fact that the eviction moratorium applied to all
tenants, including those who suffered no economic hardship
or inability to pay as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, this case does not involve government contracts,
so we must defer to the governor's judgment as to the
best way to achieve the compelling government purpose.
See 
Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 413. Requiring
tenants to prove financial hardship in order to stop eviction
proceedings would create further uncertainty and would force
tenants to expend limited personal and financial resources to
maintain their homes. And some tenants may not have the
ability to gather sufficient evidence to prove an inability to
pay, and therefore would lose their homes despite suffering
pandemic-related economic distress. Finally, requiring proof
of financial hardship potentially would have created the need
for thousands of tenants to appear in court, further risking
exposure to and spread of COVID-19.
In addition, the governor's proclamations required tenants
to pay rent if they had the financial resources to pay.
Proclamation 20-19.1 and all subsequent proclamations
contained the statement that “Tenants, residents, and renters
who are not materially affected by COVID-19 should
and must continue to pay rent, to avoid unnecessary and
avoidable economic hardship to landlords, property owners,
and property managers who are economically impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic.” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 2.
We conclude that the temporary eviction moratorium was
reasonable and necessary to serve the legitimate public
purpose of preventing homelessness and the spread of
COVID-19.
Accordingly, we hold that the eviction moratorium did
not unconstitutionally impair the appellants’ contractual
relationship with their tenants.
CONCLUSION
We affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor
of the State.

The State argues that even if the proclamations exceeded the governor's authority under 
RCW
43.06.220(1)(h), the legislature's enactment of E2SSB 5160 ratified the governor's reliance on that statute
to issue the eviction moratorium. Because we hold that the governor did have authority, we do not address
this issue.
11
There is some question whether the appellants are entitled to an equitable remedy – a declaratory judgment
– on their takings claim. The remedy for a government taking is compensation through a damages award,
but the appellants’ complaint does not request damages. However, the State does not argue that we should
decline to address the takings claim, and therefore we do not address this issue.
12
The appellants also briefly argue that the eviction moratorium took the rental income to which they were
entitled. But it is undisputed that the moratorium did not eliminate the appellants’ ability to collect the full
amount of past rent due, as long as they offered a reasonable repayment plan to their tenants.
