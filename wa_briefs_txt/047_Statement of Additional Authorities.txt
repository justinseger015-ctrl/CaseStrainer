The following are offered as additional authority: 
 Gonzalez–Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 150–51, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 
165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) This is a counsel of choice case 
explaining  the right to counsel  “derives from the root 
meaning of the constitutional  guarantee.” It does not 
depend on  the quality or skill level of counsel-which is 
different from Ineffective assistance of counsel cases.

(1984) This Court has sole authority under art 4 sec. 1 to
