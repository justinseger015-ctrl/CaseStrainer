A. 
IDENTITY OF PETITIONER 
 
Justin Lewis asks this court to accept review of the decision 
designated in Part B. 
B. 
COURT DECISION ON REVIEW 
Mr. Justin seeks reversal of his Asotin County judgment and 
sentence, 17-1-00053-3, (Appendix A)(attached hereto and 
incorporated herein by reference)  and of the Court of Appeals 
decision affirming his conviction. A copy of the decision is attached. 
(Appendix B) (attached hereto and incorporated herein by 
reference) .  
C. 
ISSUE PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 
Mr. Justin Lewis’ constitutional right to counsel was violated 
when he was appointed a public defender to represent him who 
was not licensed or authorized to practice law in Washington State. 
D. 
STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
 
Justin Lewis was indigent during all stages of his criminal 
proceedings in Asotin County cause number 17-1-00053-3. 
Appendix E (attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference). 
Asotin County appointed Robert J. Van Idour to represent Mr. 
Lewis in his criminal trial and proceedings for assault in the first 

--- Page 6 ---
 
- 2 - 
degree. Mr. Lewis was convicted as charged and filed an appeal to 
Division III under case number 35775-9-III.  
Several days before the Court of Appeals issued its opinion 
on April 11, 2019, Mr. Lewis heard rumor that Mr. Van Idour was 
never licensed to practice law in Washington State. At Mr. Lewis’ 
request, Lise Ellner, counsel on appeal, contacted Asotin County 
and disciplinary counsel for WSBA in this matter. Asotin County 
asserted that Mr. Van Idour was permitted to practice in Washtinton 
State.  
On April 19, 2019 disciplinary counsel for the bar provided  
Ms. Ellner with a letter and formal complaint confirming that Mr. 
Van Idour was never licensed or authorized to practice law in 
Washington State. See Appendix C (attached hereto and 
incorporated by reference herein). 
Ms. Ellner contacted the Office of public Defense to seek 
additional information regarding Mr. Van Idour’s status when 
obtaining an indigent defense contract in Asotin County. See 
Appendix D (attached hereto and incorporated by reference 
herein). 
The e-mail exchanges indicate that Asotin County incorrectly 

--- Page 7 ---
 
- 3 - 
asserted that Mr. Van Idour was under the supervision of Neil Fox 
working pro hac vice, when according to disciplinary counsel for the 
WSBA, Mr. Van Idour was not authorized to work pro hac vice. See 
Appendices C, D. 
Judge Gallina who presided over Mr. Lewis’ case was aware 
of this fact and issued an order that “purported” but did not permit 
Mr. Van Idour to practice in Washington without a Washington 
State license. See Appendix C. 
E. 
ARGUMENT WHY REVIEW SHOULD BE ACCEPTED 
MR. LEWIS WAS DENIED HIS STATE 
AND 
STATE 
AND 
FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHT 
TO 
COUNSEL BY THE APPOINTMENT 
AND 
REPRESENTATION 
OF 
A 
PERSON NEVER AUTHORIZED OR 
LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN 
WASHINGTON STATE 
 
a. 
Procedural Posture 
Mr. Lewis is unlawfully restrained in violation of RAP 16.4(b) 
and (c)(2) by virtue of denial of his state and federal constitutional 
right to counsel during his felony criminal proceedings .  To obtain 
relief under a Personal Restraint Petition, (“PRP”) Mr. Lewis also 
establishes he has had no prior opportunity for judicial review. 
 

--- Page 8 ---

b. 
Sixth Amendment Right To Licensed 
Counsel Violated 
 
Mr. Lewis was denied his constitutional right to counsel by 
the appointment and representation of Mr. Van Idour, who was 
never licensed to practice law in Washington State.  
The Sixth Amendment guarantees indigent defendants in 
state and federal criminal proceedings, appointed counsel in any 
case in which a term of imprisonment is imposed. U.S. Const. 
Amend. 6, 14; U.S. v. Bryant, 136 S.Ct. 1954 (2016); Gideon v. 
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); 
State v. Johnson, 179 Wn.2d 534, 315 P.3d 1090 (2014), cert. 
denied, 135 S.Ct. 139, 190 L.Ed.2d 105 (2014).  
Washington State Const. art. I, § 22 (amend 10) provides the 
equivalent right to appointed counsel. State v. Roberts, 142 Wn.2d 
471, 515, 14 P.3d 713 (2000). The purpose of this right is to 
guarantee all defendants the right to a fair trial. Wheat v. United 
States, 486 U.S. 153, 158-59, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 
(1988). 
 “[T]he assistance of counsel is among those ‘constitutional 
rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated 
as harmless error’”. Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489, 98 

--- Page 9 ---
 
- 5 - 
S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) (citing Chapman v. California, 
386 U.S. 18, 43, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)).  
It is structural error “if an indigent defendant is denied an 
attorney ….  Weaver v. Massachusetts, ___U.S. ____, 137 S.Ct. 
1899, 1903,  198 L.Ed.2d 420 (2017) (citing Gideon,  372 U.S. at 
343–345 (emphasis added) (right to an attorney).  
The Court in Weaver explained that: 
Despite its name, the term “structural error” carries 
with it no talismanic significance as a doctrinal matter. 
It means only that the government is not entitled to 
deprive the defendant of a new trial by showing that 
the error was “harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.” Chapman, 386 U.S., at 24. 
 
Weaver, 137 S.Ct. at 1908.1 
The Supreme Court explained, “the right to counsel granted 
by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a 
person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that 
judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.” Brewer v. 
Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) 
(emphasis added); see also United States v. Turnbull, 888 F.2d 
636, 638 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that “counsel” means “attorney” 
 
1 Burden on defendant to show prejudice in certain ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims involving public trial rights not objected to during trial) 

--- Page 10 ---
 
- 6 - 
under the Sixth Amendment); Solina, 709 F.2d at 167 2 
“Nothing in the language or the history of the sixth 
amendment 
to 
the 
Constitution” 
contemplates 
permitting 
representation by persons who are not qualified attorneys, because 
unlicensed lay representation does not “further” the objectives of 
the Sixth Amendment. United States v. Wright, 568 F.2d 142, 143 
(9th Cir 1978). 
“[The] right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be 
deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, 
but it is in ours.” Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344. “Reason and reflection 
require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal 
justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a 
lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for 
him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth. Gideon, 372 U.S. at 
344.  
Representation by a person not licensed to practice before 
the court in which he or she appears does not satisfy a defendant’s 
 
2 Cf United States v. French, 748 F.3d 922 (2014) (District court erred by 
encouraging or permitting co-defendant’s husband to direct pro se examination of 
witnesses despite defendant’s unequivocal exertion of her right to proceed pro se 
because lay representation is prohibited under Wheat, 486 U.S. 153, but error 
harmless in French’s case based on specific facts that her co-defendant husband 
pursued same defense theory and approach as defendant. 

--- Page 11 ---
 
- 7 - 
Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and voids any proceeding in 
which the person appears. Solina, 709 U.S. at 167, citing Harrison 
v. United States, 387 F.2d 2013, 212-13 (1967), reversed on other 
grounds, 392 U.S. 219, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968) 
(citing Zerbst, 304 U.S. at 468).   
For example, in Solina, the defendant was represented by a 
person who went to law school but never passed the bar, although 
from the record he appeared skilled. Solina, 709 F.2d at 160-65. 
The United States argued that this should issue should be 
considered under a harmless error standard. Id. The Court citing 
Zerbst, reversed and remanded for a new trial holding that the state 
was incorrect to suggest a harmless error standard and 
admonished that “prosecutors, trial courts, or both, would do well to 
make sure that persons representing criminal defendants are duly 
licensed to practice.” Solina, 709 F.2d at 169 fn. 10; Zerbst, 304 
U.S. at 465-69.  
 “[O]ne never admitted to practice law and therefore who 
never acquired the threshold qualification to represent a client in [a 
Washington State] court cannot be allowed to do so ... for purposes 
of the Sixth Amendment.” United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682, 

--- Page 12 ---
 
- 8 - 
697 (9th Cir. 1986). Other circuits agree. See, e.g., Solina, 709 F.2d 
at 168; Harrison, 387 F.2d at 212-14.  
Here, Mr. Lewis, as in Solina, was denied his constitutional 
right to a licensed lawyer, an error that cannot be deemed 
harmless.  Mr. Van Idour was never a licensed member of the 
Washington 
Bar 
Association. 
Once 
Mr. 
Lewis 
requested 
appointment of counsel by the court, he was entitled to 
representation by a Washington State licensed lawyer at all critical 
stages of his trial. Here, under the state and federal constitutions 
and the legal precedent cited herein, Mr. Lewis was denied his 
constitutional right to counsel because Mr. Van Idour, was never a 
“lawyer” in Washington State. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458; Gideon; Solina, 
709 F.2d 160. 
The remedy for violation of Mr. Lewis’ denial of his right to 
counsel requires automatic reversal. Gideon, 372 U.S. at 343-45. 
F. 
CONCLUSION 
 
Mr. Lewis respectfully requests this Court grant his personal 
restrain petition, reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial.

Ms. Kemp, good morning. 
 
Our office is currently reviewing the applications submitted by counties for 2018 public defense 
improvement funds, and we are seeking one clarification regarding the application submitted by 
Asotin County. 
 
The application indicates that Robert J. Van Idour currently has a new contract for representation 
on felony cases. However, based on the Washington State Bar Association’s website, he appears 
to not be a licensed attorney within Washington. We were curious as to what arrangement might 
be in place for an out-of-state attorney to take on a full-time felony contract. 
 
Thank you in advance,
