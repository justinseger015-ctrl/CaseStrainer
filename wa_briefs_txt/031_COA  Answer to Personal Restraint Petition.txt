discussion herein. Pertinent to the issues raised, which this Court specifically 
requested that the State address, are recited herein. 
The Petitioner was represented initially by John Fay, but Mr. Fay was later 
replaced by attorney Robert Van ldour who represented the Petitioner through 
conclusion of trial. 
Bond Order (10/04/16), and Motion and Order Allowing 
Withdrawal and Substitution. Mr. Van ldour was, and is still currently, a member 
of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and was assigned, at that 
time, to provide public defense, on contract under APR 8(c). Declaration of 
Robert J. Van ldour. Mr. Van ldour represented the Petitioner throughout the 
remainder of the case, including trial and sentencing. Report of Proceedings 
(hereinafter RP}, generally. 
During trial, the State called Detective Brian Denny, who testified that he 
interviewed the Petitioner and provided the substance of statements made by 
the Petitioner. RP 90-2. Thereafter, Det. Denny was cross examined on these 
statements. RP 98-9. Det. Denny was never asked, nor did he testify concerning 
the existence of any recorded interview, nor was one offered into evidence by 
either the State or the Petitioner at trial. RP 90-2, 98-9. The Petitioner testified, 
during cross examination, that he believed that Det. Denny had recorded the 
conversation, but State's counsel pointed out that the Petitioner had declined to 
be recorded. RP 189-90. Upon being pressed, he clarified that he wasn't sure, 
due to the passage of time, whether it had been recorded or not. RP 189-90. 
More than a year after the Petitioner's trial and sentencing, the judge who 
presided over trial, Scott D. Gallina, was arrested and charged with sexual 
related felony and gross misdemeanor charges for actions unrelated to this trial. 
Those charges are currently pending. See State of Washington v. Scott D. 
Gallina, Asotin Superior Court Cause 19-1-00066-02.

4. 
The Petitioner appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by this Court in 
an unpublished opinion. See State v. Ayerst, supra. The Petitioner then filed 
this personal restraint petition, alleging a myriad of claims, the majority of which 
this Court has declined to request responses from the State. The issues posited 
by the Petitioner are largely confusing and not well articulated. As the State 
understands, this Court has requested responses to the following claims: 1) that 
the Judge Gallina "is not credible", which the State understands to be a claim of 
bias; 2) that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington; 3) that the 
State's attorney had improper contact with members of the jury venire prior to 
jury selection; and 4) that Det. Denny committed perjury by denying the 
existence of a recording of his interview with the Petitioner. If there are others 
that the Court is requesting response to, the State would ask that the Court 
clarify. 
GROUNDS FOR RELIEF AND ARGUMENT 
RAP 16.11(b) authorizes dismissal of the petition if the petition is clearly 
without merit. The Respondent submits that the issues raised by the Petitioner 
are without merit and lack any basis in fact or in the law. 
A PRP is not a substitute for a direct appeal. In re Pers. Restraint of 
Hagler, 97 Wn.2d 818, 824, 650 P.2d 1103 ( 1982). Courts are reluctant to 
overturn a settled judicial decision where the Petitioner has had an opportunity 
for direct appellate review. In re Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 676, 
327 P. 3d 660 (2014). Therefore, there are limitations on the use of a PRP to 
collaterally attack a conviction. Hagler, 97 Wn.2d at 824. A personal restraint 
petition must state with particularity the factual allegations which, if proven, 
would entitle the petitioner to relief. In re Pers. Restraint of Rice, 118 Wn.2d 
876, 886, 828 P.2d 1086 (1992). 
Factual allegations must be supported by 
evidence. 118 Wn.2d at 886. If the record does not support the factual

allegations, then the petitioner must show through affidavits or other forms of 
corroboration that competent and admissible evidence will establish the factual 
allegations. 118 Wn.2d at 886. Bald assertions and conclusory allegations are 
not sufficient. Id. 
To be entitled to collateral relief through a PRP the Petitioner must prove 
the existence of error by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Pers. Restraint 
of Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479, 490, 251 P. 3d 884 (2010). Assuming error 
can be shown, he is also required to prove prejudice. Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 676. 
The significance of the level of prejudice depends on the type of error shown. 
Id. To be entitled to relief for a constitutional error, a petitioner must also prove 
by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "actual and 
substantial prejudice." 
Id. (Emphasis added). 
This prejudice "must be 
determined in light of the totality of circumstances," and exists only if the error 
"so infected petitioner' s entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due 
process." In re Pers. Restraint of Music, 104 Wn.2d 189, 191, 704 P.2d 144 ( 
1985). 
To be entitled to relief for a nonconstitutional error, a petitioner must prove 
by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "a fundamental 
defect resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice." In re Pers. Restraint of 
Elmore, 162 Wn.2d 236,251, 172 P.3d 335 (2007) (emphasis added). With this 
as the backdrop, the State will respond to the issues raised for which response 
was requested. 
A. 
THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY CLAIM THAT THE TRIAL 
JUDGE WAS BIASED OR PREJUDICED AGAINST THE PETITIONER. 
The Petitioner claims that "the Honorable Scott Gallina was not credible." 
The Appellant presumably is arguing that the legal troubles that the judge has 
currently pending cast negative aspersions at his qualifications to sit as a

superior court judge. The State does not disagree that such allegations, if true, 
are reprehensible and would certainly be cause for his removal from office. His 
claim further appears to presuppose that the fact of subsequent charges 
necessarily results in the Petitioner's conviction being rendered void. However, 
the Petitioner offers no legal authority for this proposition and the State, after 
diligent search, could not find a single case where a conviction was reversed 
based upon subsequent criminal behavior of the trial judge. 
The State found a few cases involving judges who were involved in 
criminal activities, but they are distinguishable. In In Interest of McFall, 533 Pa. 
24, 617 A.2d 707, 711 (1992), a number of defendant's sought new trials based 
upon allegations that the judge therein, while working for the F.B.I. as an 
informant as a result of having been caught committing a criminal act, continued 
to preside over criminal and juvenile matters during that time. McFall, at 32. In 
McFall, a quid pro quo bargain existed where the judge's cooperation would be 
made known to the same authorities who appeared before her to prosecute 
cases against the appellees therein. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
determined that the appearances of fairness mandated new trials, not because 
of the underlying criminal act, but because the judge's biases and loyalties could 
reasonably and objectively be questioned. This is because, to a disinterested 
observer, the judge would likely be viewed as attempting to curry favor with the 
prosecuting authorities, which necessarily would have included the jurisdiction 
over whose case she continued to preside. Therein, the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court stated: 
One could reasonably conclude that, under the circumstances, 
Cunningham's cooperation with the United States Attorney's office 
cast her in the role of a confederate of the prosecutors in the 
appellees' cases. 
McFall, 533 Pa. 24 at 35. No such alliance occurred here, where the Judge 
Gallina was not arrested until more than a year after the Petitioner's trial and did 
not preside over any more cases thereafter.

In a more infamous case, a Pennsylvania Juvenile Court Judge received 
secret payments from the owners of a facility where juveniles were housed, and 
in those cases, the Court reversed delinquency adjudications. See In re Bruno, 
627 Pa. 505, 566, 101 A.3d 635, 671-72 (2014)(discussing Former Judge Mark 
Ciavarella's corruption and the fallout therefrom). However, in that case, the 
judge receiving bribes had a clear pecuniary interest which clearly impugned the 
appearance of his impartiality in the decisions rendered in those cases. There, it 
is easy to recognize that the judge had a financial interest in sending adjudicated 
delinquents to the detention facility that was paying him to do so. Here, no such 
profit motive or other incentive is alleged or apparent. While the State neither 
dismisses nor condones the conduct of Judge Gallina, there are no indications or 
reasons to speculate that his impartiality in this case was subject to reasonable 
question. 
A judge should not only be impartial, but should appear so. 
In re 
Swenson, 158 Wn. App. 812, 818, 244 P.3d 959 (2010). 
11Evidence of a judge's 
actual or potential bias must be shown before an appearance of fairness claim 
will succeed." State v. Chamberlin, 161 Wn.2d 30, 37, 162 P.3d 389 (2007). 
While, if true, the allegations against Judge Gallina seriously impugn his 
character. However, the allegations fail to demonstrate that his partiality would 
be questioned; i.e. that one side had an advantage going into the case. Frankly, 
standing alone, the fact that a judge is involved in criminal activities would tend 
to lead an outside observer to believe that a defendant, rather than the State 
would have the advantage. Here, the judge was not working with authorities or 
seeking some benefit from the State in exchange for leniency on pending 
charges, nor did he have any pecuniary or personal interest in the outcome of 
the case. The record does not so reflect any bias or appearance thereof, nor has 
the Petitioner so demonstrated.

B. 
WHILE TRIAL COUNSEL WAS NOT FORMALLY LICENSED. HE WAS 
ELIGIBLE TO PRACTICE UNDER APR 8 AND THERE IS NO SHOWING 
THAT HE WAS OTHERWISE UNAUTHORIZED TO PRACTICE, NOR 
DOES THE PETITIONER DEMONSTRATE PREJUDICE. 
There can be no question that a criminal defendant has the right to 
effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington State Constitution. 
See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647,672,101 P.3d 1 (2004). 
Where a defendant is denied counsel because the "attorney" was not licensed in 
any state, prejudice may be presumed. See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 
474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), atrd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). However, this per se rule 
does not apply where the attorney is licensed to practice but merely lacks a 
license in the jurisdiction where the case occurs. Id. Here, Mr. Van !dour was 
licensed (for more than 30 years) in Idaho. Even assuming that his qualifications 
under APR 8(c) were lacking, he was an attorney licensed to practice. As a 
result, there was no per se deprivation of counsel because Mr. Van !dour was 
licensed to practice in Idaho, and the Petitioner must therefore make a further 
factual showing. 
To establish that the right to effective assistance of counsel has been 
violated, the Petitioner must make two showings: that counsel's representation 
was deficient and that counsel's deficient representation caused prejudice. Id. 
(quoting State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995)). 
The Petitioner makes no showing that Mr. Van ldour was ineffective. Other than 
the claim that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice law in Washington, the 
Petitioner points to no specific conduct or action that constituted deficient 
performance. His claim therefore necessarily fails.

STATE'S 
COUNSEL 
DID 
NOT 
HAVE ANY CONTACT 
WITH 
PROSPECTIVE JURORS, EXCEPT AS APPROPRIATE THROUGH 
VIOR DIRE, AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SUCH 
CLAIM. 
The Petitioner claims that State's counsel had inappropriate contact with 
prospective jurors. He accuses the deputy prosecutor of having coffee and 
laughing with the jury venire in the hallway before trial began. 
The State 
vehemently denies any such conduct occurred.2 The record does not support 
this claim, which most certainly would have been brought to the attention of the 
court by trial counsel. The Petitioner's claims lack any factual basis aside from 
his own self serving accusations. This is insufficient as a matter of law and 
should be rejected out of hand by this Court. 
See In re Pers. Restraint of 
Williams, 111 Wn.2d 353, 365, 759 P .2d 436 {1998). 
D. 
DET. DENNY DID NOT COMMIT PERJURY NOR DID HE TESTIFY 
CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF ANY RECORDING. 
Finally, the Petitioner claims that Det. Denny committed perjury when he 
testified that the interview was not recorded and by "failing to play the recording." 
Once again, the Petitioner's claims are unsupported by the record. First, Det. 
Denny never testified concerning the existence of any recording. It was the 
Petitioner who testified to the existence of a recording. Then when pressed on 
cross examination, he acknowledged that he wasn't even sure that the recording 
existed. The State represents that no such recording was made because the 
Petitioner refused to be recorded. See RCW 9.73.030. In any event, his claims 
of perjury necessarily fail in any event, where the detective offered no such

UNPUBLISHED OPINION 
LAWRENCE-BERREY, C.J. -
Robert L. Ayerst appeals his conviction for attempted 
second degree burglary. He contends the evidence was insufficient to support his 
conviction. He also filed a statement of additional grounds for review in which he 
appears to assert that his trial counsel was ineffective and that the trial court erred by 
denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the charges. We reject his challenges and affirm. 
FACTS 
The State charged Mr. Ayerst with attempted second degree burglary and second 
degree malicious mischief, 1 stemming from Mr. Ayerst's actions on the early morning of 
1 Mr. Ayerst was later charged with bail jumping by amended information based 
on his failure to appear in court as required for a pretrial hearing on April 3, 2017. 

--- Page 11 ---
No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayers! 
September 6, 2016. The facts are related from the trial testimony. 
Bruce Meacham arrived at his business, the Mr. Suds Car Wash in Clarkston, 
Washington, at approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of September 6, 2016. He 
observed that the doors to the equipment room appeared damaged2 and that a tow strap 
was hanging from the handle but nothing appeared to be missing. Report of Proceedings 
(RP) at 64-65. Mr. Meacham called the police and provided security footage from the car 
wash parking lot. The footage depicted Mr. Ayerst arriving at the car wash around 
2:20 a.m. in his white GMC pickup truck. 
Mr. Ayerst drove his truck through the car wash lot, past the doors to the 
equipment room, and pulled into one of the wash bays. He exited his truck and began 
washing it. An unidentified passenger exited the truck holding what appeared to be a tow 
strap with a metal hook under his sweatshirt. The passenger walked off camera in the 
direction of the equipment room doors. He then returned to the truck, no longer carrying 
the tow strap. A short time later, the passenger again exited the truck and disappeared off 
camera in the direction of the equipment room. 
2 Mr. Meacham testified that he obtained an estimate of approximately $1,900 to 
repair the damaged doors.

No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
After Mr. Ayerst finished washing the truck, the passenger rejoined him and the 
truck backed out of the wash bay, exited the lot, and entered on the other side of the car 
wash. The truck pulled up to the vacuums next to the car wash and then backed up out of 
view of the camera to the area in front of the equipment room doors. The truck remained 
in that position a short time before it pulled forward and exited the lot. The equipment 
room doors could not be seen on the security footage, but the footage did show that Mr. 
Ayerst's headlights "dip[ped]" as the truck began to pull forward. Report of Proceedings 
(RP) at 75. Detective Bryon Denny testified that he believed the lowering of the 
headlights was consistent with the vehicle having some type of dragging motion on it 
because the area where the truck was located was an asphalt area where there were no 
dips or bumps that would have caused the truck "to jar in that motion." RP at 76. He 
posited that Mr. Ayerst and his unidentified accomplice had attached the tow strap to the 
doors and the truck, and then pulled away, springing the doors open and leaving the tow 
strap behind. 
Officer Brian Odenborg observed Mr. Ayerst's truck at approximately 2:55 a.m. at 
the Zip Trip convenience store located across the street from Mr. Suds. The officer noted 
that the two men sitting in the car did not make eye contact or otherwise acknowledge his 
presence, which he found suspicious. Due to the hour of the night and the apparent lack 
3

No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
of purpose to the men's presence at the store, he ran the plate on the truck through 
dispatch and it returned to Mr. Ayerst, a resident of Dayton, Washington. 
The State subsequently arrested Mr. Ayerst, who denied that he was in Clarkston 
on September 6, 2016. When police showed him a still frame from the security footage, 
Mr. Ayerst denied that he was the person in the footage and claimed that he often loaned 
out his vehicle. 
At trial, Mr. Ayerst testified that on the early morning of September 6, he was 
driving from his home in Dayton to visit his sister in Weippe, Idaho, to discuss the 
circumstances surrounding their mother's death. Along the way, he stopped and picked 
up a stranded motorist who needed a jump. Mr. Ayerst then decided to stop at Mr. Suds 
to wash his truck. The unidentified motorist accompanied him to the car wash, and they 
went to the Zip Trip to get food once Mr. Ayerst finished washing his truck. Mr. Ayerst 
ultimately decided not to visit his sister and, instead, drove back home to Dayton. 
Mr. Ayerst denied attaching a tow strap to his truck or seeing his passenger 
attaching a tow strap to anything. His theory was that his headlights "dipped" as 
described by Detective Denny because there were two homeless individuals sleeping in 
the car wash parking lot and he had to brake suddenly when backing up toward the doors 
to avoid backing over one of the sleeping men. Defense counsel's theory at trial was that 
4 

--- Page 14 ---
No. 35867-4-111 
State v. Ayerst 
the security footage demonstrated there was insufficient time off-camera for either Mr. 
Ayerst or his passenger to attach the tow strap to the truck. 
The jury found Mr. Ayerst guilty of attempted burglary in the second degree, 
second degree malicious mischief, and bail jumping. The trial court imposed a standard 
range sentence of 55.5 months based on Mr. Ayerst's offender score of 22, rejecting the 
State's request for an exceptional sentence pursuant to RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c). 
ANALYSIS 
On appeal, Mr. Ayerst claims there was insufficient evidence to convict him of 
attempted burglary in the second degree. 
A. STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR SUFFICIENCY CHALLENGES 
"Due process requires the State to prove all elements of the crime beyond a 
reasonable doubt." State v. Washington, 135 Wn. App. 42, 48, 143 P.3d 606 (2006). In a 
sufficiency challenge, the inquiry is "whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt." State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192,201, 829 P.2d 1068 (1992). All 
reasonable inferences are drawn in the State's favor, and the evidence is interpreted most 
strongly against the defendant. Id. Circumstantial evidence receives the same weight as 
direct evidence. State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 874, 83 P.3d 970 (2004). This court 
5 

--- Page 15 ---
No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
defers to the fact finder on the resolution of conflicting testimony, credibility 
determinations, and the persuasiveness of the evidence. Id. at 874-75. 
B. SECOND DEGREE BURGLARY 
Mr. Ayerst claims there is insufficient evidence to support his attempted burglary 
conviction because the State failed to prove that he had any intent to commit a crime 
inside the car wash. He contends that under State v. Jackson, 112 Wn.2d 867, 774 P.2d 
1211 {1989), intent to commit a crime could not be inferred from his equivocal behavior. 
A person commits second degree burglary "if, with intent to commii a crime 
against a person or property therein, he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a building 
other than a vehicle or a dwelling." RCW 9A.52.030(1). A person "attempts" an offense 
when, with the intent to commit a specific crime, he or she takes a substantial step toward 
committing the crime. RCW 9A.28.020{1). A "substantial step" is conduct that is 
"' strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.'" State v. Townsend, 14 7 
Wn.2d 666,679, 57 P.3d 255 (2002) (quoting State v: Aumick, 126 Wn.2d 422,427,894 
P.2d 1325 (1995)). The requisite intent for attempted burglary may be inferred where the 
defendant attempted to enter a building by force and the manner of entry illustrated the 
defendant's intent to enter for illegal reasons. See e.g., State v. Bencivenga, 137 Wn.2d 
703, 974 P.2d 832 (1999) (sufficient evidence of intent where defendant attempted to pry 
6 

--- Page 16 ---
No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
open door to Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) at 3 :30 a.m.); State v. Brooks, 107 Wn. App. 
925, 927-28, 29 P.3d 45 (2001) (defendant's use of screwdriver to attempt to open door, 
rather than conventional methods of entry, illustrated defendant's intent to enter 
apartment for illegal reasons). 
Mr. Ayerst claims that Jackson requires reversal of his attempted burglary 
conviction. The defendant in Jackson was charged with attempted second degree 
burglary after he repeatedly kicked a door window, damaging it, and fled when he 
realized a police officer was watching him. 112 Wn.2d at 870. Over the defendant's 
objection, the trial court instructed the jury that a person who attempts to enter or remain 
unlawfully in a building may be inferred to have acted with the intent to commit a crime 
against a person or property therein. Id. at 872. The Washington Supreme Court reversed 
the conviction and remanded for a new trial, holding the court erred by giving the 
instruction where the defendant engaged in equivocal behavior that could evince an intent 
to commit burglary or an intent to commit malicious mischief. Id. at 876. 
Mr. Ayerst's reliance on Jackson is misplaced because Jackson only addressed 
instructional error and did not analyze the sufficiency of the evidence. Since Mr. Ayerst 
7 

--- Page 17 ---
No. 35867-4-Ill 
State v. Ayerst 
does not assert instructional error, Jackson's analysis is largely irrelevant to Mr. Ayerst's 
case.3 
Instead, Mr. Ayerst's case is controlled by Bencivenga, 137 Wn.2d 703. In that 
case, a witness saw the defendant attempting to pry open the back door of a KFC at 3:30 
a.m. Id. at 705. The defendant admitted to trying to force the door open but claimed he 
did not intend to steal anything and was simply trying to win a bet. Id. at 706. The trial 
court found the defendant guilty of attempted second degree burglary and Division One of 
this court reversed based on its reading of Jackson. 
The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the analysis in Jackson only applies to 
the propriety of a permissive inference instruction. Although a judge may be restricted 
from guiding jurors' assessments of the facts, "[n]othing forbids a jury ... from logically 
inferring intent from proven facts, so long as it is satisfied the state has proved that intent 
beyond a reasonable doubt." Id. at 709. "An essential function of the fact finder is to 
discount theories which it determines unreasonable." Id. Although an inference of guilt 
should not arise where other reasonable conclusions may be drawn, ultimately "it is the 
3 This court recently recognized in an unpublished opinion that "Jackson does not 
apply to the question ofwhether sufficient evidence supports a jury's verdict." State v. 
Perez, No. 35043-6-IIl, slip op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2018)

State v. Ayerst 
province of the finder of fact to determine what conclusions reasonably follow from the 
particular evidence in a case." Id. at 711. 
The evidence here was sufficient to permit a jury to find that Mr. Ayerst intended 
to burglarize the Mr. Suds. Mr. Ayerst drove his truck to the car wash at 2:30 in the 
morning accompanied by a passenger carrying a tow strap that matched the strap found on 
the damaged doors. The passenger disappeared in the direction of the doors and 
reappeared without the strap, and Mr. Ayerst proceeded to back the truck up to the 
equipment room doors. Although there was no direct evidence that Mr. Ayerst or his 
passenger attached his truck to the doors, the footage demonstrated that Mr. Ayerst's 
headlights "dipped" as he pulled away from the area of the doors, indicating that the truck 
was experiencing some drag or resistance consistent with the truck being attached to the 
doors. An officer then observed Mr. Ayerst and his passenger sitting across the street in 
the Zip Trip parking lot, suggesting that they may have been watching to see if their 
actions had drawn any attention before returning to remove property from the equipment 
room. This circumstantial evidence tended to show that not only was Mr. Ayerst trying to 
enter the Mr. Suds, he did so with the intent to commit a crime therein. The jury was 
entitled to make the reasonable inference that Mr. Ayerst intended to enter the car wash 
and remove property.

No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
C. STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR REVIEW (SAG) 
Mr. Ayerst has filed a SAG in which he appears to assert ineffective assistance of 
counsel as well as an argument that the trial court erred by denying his Knapstad4 motion 
to dismiss all charges. 
i. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
Mr. Ayerst claims his trial counsel erred by failing to present evidence that the 
Clarkston Police Department received a call at 3:30 a.m. from a neighbor of the Mr. Suds 
reporting a loud noise, nearly one hour after Mr. Ayerst left the Mr. Suds. 
To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant carries the 
burden of demonstrating ( 1) the attorney's performance was deficient-that is, it fell 
below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) the deficiency prejudiced the 
accused-that is, absent the deficiency there is a reasonable probability that the result of 
the proceeding would have been different. State v. Humphries, 181 Wn.2d 708, 719-20, 
336 P.3d 1121 (2014). To rebut the presumption of effective assistance of counsel, the 
defendant must establish the absence of any "conceivable legitimate tactic explaining 
counsel's performance." State v. Reichenbach, 153 Wn.2d 126, 130, 101 P.3d 80 (2004). 
4 State v. Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d 346, 729 P.2d 48 (1986). 
10 

--- Page 20 ---
No. 35867-4-ITI 
State v. Ayerst 
The only reference in the record regarding a neighbor hearing a noise is an 
Investigative Narrative prepared by Officer Lorz indicating that, "A neighbor stated that 
he may have heard a noise around 0330 hours that morning." CP at 43. There is nothing 
in the record to indicate that a neighbor called to report a noise nor is there any 
information regarding the neighbor's identity or trial counsel's efforts to investigate this 
statement. The factual record is therefore insufficient to review this argument. 
Moreover, Mr. Ayerst has failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the 
outcome of his trial would have been different had this limited evidence been introduced. 
The security footage placed Mr. Ayerst, a resident of Dayton, at the Mr. Suds in Clarkston 
in the middle of the night and in the company of a man carrying a tow strap that matched 
the strap found on the damaged doors. It also showed him backing his truck up to the 
doors and his headlights "dipping" as he drove away, suggesting the truck was attached to 
the doors by the strap. Although Mr. Ayerst denied damaging the doors and offered his 
own theory for why the headlights "dipped" as he drove away, the jury clearly did not 
find Mr. Ayerst credible. Given this evidence, Mr. Ayesrt has failed to demonstrate a 
reasonable probability that introduction of the single statement from the investigative 
report concerning the neighbor would have changed the outcome of the trial. 
11 

--- Page 21 ---
No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
ii. Motion to Dismiss Charges Pursuant to Knapstad 
Mr. Ayerst also claims he did not commit any of the crimes for which he was 
convicted and appears to allege that the court erred by denying his pretrial Knapstad 
motion to dismiss the charges. 
A trial court has the inherent power to dismiss a criminal prosecution for 
insufficiency of the charge. Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d at 352-53. A court may only grant a 
defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss if there are no disputed facts and the undisputed 
facts are insufficient to support a finding of guilty. Id. at 356. A trial court's denial of a 
Knapstad motion is not reviewable on appeal following trial. State v. Jackson, 82 Wn. 
App. 594,918 P.2d 945 (1996). 
Since Mr. Ayerst's case proceeded to trial, his claim that the trial court erred by 
denying his Knapstad motion is not reviewable by this court. To the extent Mr. Ayerst's 
SAG is read as claiming insufficient evidence to support his three convictions, this 
argument also fails. As explained above, sufficient evidence supported Mr. Ayerst's 
conviction for attempted second degree burglary. As to the remaining offenses, Mr. 
Ayerst argues evidence outside the record that this court may not consider. On the record 
before this court, it appears that Mr. Ayerst's convictions were supported by sufficient 
evidence. 
12

No. 35867-4-III 
State v. Ayerst 
CONCLUSION 
We conclude that sufficient evidence supports Mr. Ayerst's conviction for 
attempted second degree murder and reject Mr. Ayerst's arguments raised in his SAG. 
Affirmed. 
A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the 
Washington Appellate Reports, but it- will be filed for public record pursuant to 
RCW 2.06.040.
