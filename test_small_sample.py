    PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS IN LIMINE
    
    Plaintiffs move this Court for an Order in limine to exclude evidence.
    In Wyoming v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 2006 WL 3801910 (D. Wyo. 2006), 
    the court ruled that evidence regarding the defendant's prior bad acts 
    was inadmissible. See also Johnson v. State, 2018 WL 3037217 (Wyo. 2018).
    
    The Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 401, 402, and 403, 
    govern the admissibility of evidence.
