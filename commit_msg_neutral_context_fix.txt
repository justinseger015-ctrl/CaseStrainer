CRITICAL FIX: Add neutral citations to strict context isolator

Root Cause of First Fix Failing:
The strict context isolator (used for case name extraction) didn't know
that 2017-NM-007 was a citation. It was including it in the extraction
context, causing it to be extracted as part of the case name.

The Problem:
Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977 (2016)"

Step 1: Extract citations → Found: 388 P.3d 977
Step 2: Extract case name for 388 P.3d 977
Step 3: Context isolator looks back from "388 P.3d 977"
Step 4: Doesn't recognize "2017-NM-007" as a citation boundary
Step 5: Includes it in context
Step 6: Extracted name: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007" ❌

The Fix:

1. Added neutral citation patterns to strict_context_isolator.py:
   - 2017-NM-007 pattern (New Mexico hyphenated)
   - 2017 ND 123 pattern (other states space-separated)

2. Enhanced cleaning patterns in unified_citation_processor_v2.py:
   - Handle years in parentheses after citations: (2016)
   - Added space-separated neutral citation cleaning

Expected Result Now:
Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977 (2016)"

Step 1: Extract citations → Found: 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977
Step 2: Extract case name for 388 P.3d 977
Step 3: Context isolator looks back from "388 P.3d 977"
Step 4: Recognizes "2017-NM-007" as citation boundary ✅
Step 5: Stops before it
Step 6: Extracted name: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe" ✅
Step 7: Cleaning removes any remaining neutral citations

Impact:
- Neutral citations now properly excluded from case names
- Both neutral and regional citations extracted separately
- Proper clustering of parallel citations

This completes the neutral citation support implementation.
