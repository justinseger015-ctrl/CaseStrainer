    In the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court 
    held that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. This decision overturned 
    the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).
    
    Later, in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Court established the requirement 
    that suspects must be informed of their rights before custodial interrogation. This built 
    upon earlier due process protections recognized in cases like Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).
    
    The Court's approach to privacy rights evolved significantly in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973),
    which recognized a constitutional right to privacy in reproductive decisions. This case has been
    the subject of extensive legal debate and subsequent Supreme Court decisions for decades.
