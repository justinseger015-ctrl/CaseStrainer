DOES THE COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION IN MATTER OF LEWIS CONFLICT WITH THIS COURT'S DECISION IN CITY OF SEATTLE VS.RATLIFF? 2. DOES THE COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION, IN WHICH THE COURT APPLIED EXISTING LAW TO DEFENDANT'S CASE, INVOLVE AN ISSUE OF SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC INTEREST? II.SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT 1. THE COURT'S DECISION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH RA TL/FF BECAUSE RA TUFF IS SPECIFIC TO APR 9 LEGAL INTERNS AND FITS WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK USED BY THE COURT IN THIS CASE 2. THE COURT'S DECISION DOES NOT INVOLVE AN ISSUE OF SUBSTANTIAL PUBLICATION BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COUNSEL.BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 1 Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Defendant was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. See State v. Justin C.Lewis, 35775-9-111, 2019 WL 1568058 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019)(Unpublished).1 The underlying facts of the case are immaterial and warrant no discussion. The Defendant was represented by attorney Robert Van ldour throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order (04/05/17) (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). At the time, Mr. Van I dour was a licensed member of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and was assigned to provide public defense, on contract under APR 8(c). Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had arranged to practice under APR B(c), which authorizes attorneys who are licensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in Washington. Declaration of 1 The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 2 Robert J.Van ldour, Declaration of Vivian Bly, (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). Prior to contracting with Mr. Van !dour, the Board of County Commissioners inquired of the Superior Court Judge, Scott Gallina, regarding Mr. Van ldour's qualifications to contract for public defense without being licensed in Washington. Declaration of Vivian Bly. Judge Gallina confirmed that Mr. Van ldour would be eligible through APR 8(c) process to perform duties under a contract while he applied for admission to the Washington State Bar. Throughout the process, the Superior Court Administrator made periodic efforts to contact the Washington State Bar Association to confirm that Mr. Van ldour's application was pending and processing. Declaration of Tammy Tenny,(see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). On October 26, 2017, the Court was notified via email that Mr. Van ldour's application for admission had been approved. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. In October of 2017, Mr. Van ldour indicated he needed a formal order from the Court which was provided, memorializing his acceptance by the Court as indigent defense counsel dated October 6, 2017, nunc pro tune to February 1, 2017. Declaration of BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 3 Tammy Tenny. Not until January 31, 2018, did the Court receive any information that there was any problem with Mr. Van ldour's application to practice under APR 8(c).2 The Court immediately instructed Mr. Van ldour to arrange to transfer his cases to other attorneys. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Subsequently, the Court received a letter dated February 13, 2018, indicating Mr. Van ldour was not authorized to practice in Washington courts. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. The Defendant, who was convicted on October 31, 2017 and sentenced on November 7, 2017, appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, supra. The Defendant then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging only that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington. The Defendant neither argued nor demonstrated that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor did he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. In an unpublished decision, the Division Three of the Court of Appeals dismissed the Defendant's PRP, finding 2 For what it's worth, the Asotin County Prosecutor's office did not become aware of any irregularities concerning Mr. Van ldour's eligibility to represent indigent defendants until the Court assigned new counsel to Mr. Van ldour's cases in February of 2018. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 4 that 1) the Defendant failed to allege he was prejudiced by his attorney's representation and 2) the facts set forth in the Defendant's petition failed to establish that he should be excused from showing prejudice based on a theory of structural error. Matter of Lewis, 37284-7-111 , 2021 WL 1750935 (Div. Ill, May 4, 2021) ( unpublished). 3 IV.DISCUSSION The decision to review a Court of Appeals decision terminating review is discretionary. RAP 13.4(a). A petition for review will be accepted by the Supreme Court only if at least one of four criteria are met. RAP 13.4(b); In re Coats, 173 Wn.2d 123, 132-33 (2011 ). Two criteria relevant to this petition are a) the decision of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with a decision by the Supreme Court and b) the petition involves a substantial public interest that should be determined by the Supreme Court. Id. The Defendant argues that the Court of Appeals' decision conflicts with this Court's decision in City of Seattle v. Ratliff. 100 Wn.2d 212 (1983). However, the Court of Appeals' decision here this Court's decision in Ratliff are based on a similar legal 3The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 5 framework, with the difference in outcome dictated by the distinguishing facts of each case. Furthermore, because the decision in this petition does not change the right to counsel, it does not represent a matter of substantial public interest. I.THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THIS COURT'S HOLDING IN CITY OF SEATTLE V.RA TL/FF BECAUSE THE FACTS OF THE DEFENDANT'S CASE ARE DISTINGUISHABLE IN THAT COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT WAS LICENSED IN AT LEAST ONE JURISDICTION.Generally, a defendant challenging his conviction through a Personal Restraint Petition (PRP) must show that the error raised impacted the outcome of the trial. See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Crace, 174 Wn.2d 835 (2012); In re Pers. Restraint of Finstad, 177 Wn.2d 501, 506 (2013). If the defendant cannot show that they were prejudiced by the error, then their petition is dismissed. Crace, 174 Wn.2d 847-48. An exception to the prejudice requirement exists where there is a structural error, i.e. an error which impacts the framework of the trial process. Weaver v. Massachusetts, -U.S. - -, 137 S.Ct. 1899(2017). Both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article 1, section 22 of the state constitution guarantee the right to counsel in a criminal case. Const. amend VI; Const. art. 1, § 22; See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 672, 101 P.3d 1 (2004). With regard to this right to counsel, the state BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 6 constitution provides no more protection than the Sixth Amendment. State v. Medlock, 86 Wn.App. 89, 99, review denied, 133 Wn.2d 1012 (1997). Absolute denial of counsel, such as when the "attorney" was not licensed in any state at the time of representation, does not require a showing of prejudice.4 See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), affd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). However, lesser violations of the right to counsel do not require automatic dismissal. A defendant who is represented by a person who has been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction has not suffered from a per se Sixth Amendment violation. See, e.g.,United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1132 (D.C.Cir. 2000) ("We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se ineffectiveness rule beyond those cases in which a defendant is represented by a person never properly admitted to any bar.'); United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir. 1998) ("the key to adequate representation is not technical license to practice in the jurisdiction involved, but a credential from some forum demonstrating the specialized knowledge of a lawyer.'). A defendant who was represented by a lawyer whose 4See, e.g.,Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629-30 (1993), citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 7 license has been suspended must demonstrate actual prejudice in order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 479 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 2007) (suspension of a state license not per se ineffective assistance of counsel); Hardamon v. United States, 319 F.3d 943,951 (7th Cir. 2003) (suspension of an attorney does not amount to per se ineffective assistance); State v. Edison, 61 Wn. App. 530, 811 P.2d 958 (1991) (defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice when represented by a lawyer who has been licensed but whose license was suspended). A defendant Who was represented by an out-of-state attorney who has not been admitted pro hac vice must demonstrate actual prejudice in order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., Cole v. United States, 162 F.3d 957, 959 (7th Cir. 1998); Kieser v. New York, 56 F.3d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 1995) (lawyer suspended in New Jersey and not admitted pro hac vice in New York when case was tried); United States v. Costanzo, 740 F.2d 251, 258-59 (3d Cir. 1984); Derringer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1141 (8th Cir. 1971 ). These violations are considered less serious because they do not thwart the purposes of the right to counsel. As the Court of Appeals explained in Matter of Ayerst, The limited allowance for structural error is based on two considerations. "First, courts are concerned that a BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 8 defendant have a counselor who has legal training and demonstrated the specialized knowledge and ability of a lawyer." Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 916. This concern was emphasized in the Washington Supreme Court's decision in Ratliff, where the defendant was represented by a law student who operated outside the parameters of the admission to practice rules applicable to law students. 100 Wash.2d at 217, 667 P.2d 630. Second, there is concern "an undisclosed lack of credentials may create a conflict of interest." Maria-Martinez, 143 F. 3d at 916. This consideration is based on Judge Friendly's analysis in Solina. 17 Wn.App.2d 356. Under these applicable standards, the Court of Appeals correctly determined that, while the Defendant had been deprived of counsel, the deprivation was not severe enough to constitute a structural error. Matter of Lewis, No. 37284-7-111, 2-3 (2021) (unpublished). As the Court noted, Mr. Van ldour "was and is an attorney, subject to state licensing regulations," and could have qualified to provide indigent defense representation in Washington [under APR 8]." Id. at 3. Thus, the Defendant was required to demonstrate prejudice and, because he failed to do so, the Court of Appeals dismissed his PRP.Id. The Court of Appeals decision neither conflicts with Ratliff nor undermines this Court's authority to regulate the practice of law. In Ratliff, this Court held that representation by a legal intern licensed under APR 9 ("rule 9 intern") who has been prevented BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 9 from complying with that rule is a per se violation of the right to counsel. 100 Wn.2d at 221. There, the defendant was scheduled to be tried on three charges, but his court-appointed counsel did not appear on the morning of trial. Id. at 213. Upon questioning the defendant, the court learned that he was being represented by a rule 9 intern, who had not completed law school and who had never been licensed to practice law in Washington or any other jurisdiction, in a different.case. Id. at 213-14; see APR 9(8). Despite the fact that the rule 9 intern had no involvement with the matters set for trial, the court summoned him and, after allowing the him to speak with the defendant "U]ust a little bit," attempted to proceed with the trial. Id. at 214. When the intern objected, the. court required him over objection to proceed, but allowed the defense to delay the presentation of its case until the next business day. Id. at 214. The court did not allow the intern time to consult his supervising attorney prior to trial, as required by APR 9. Id. at 215, 220; see APR 9(0). By the time that case reached this Court, two separate issues had been raised. The defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the intern was given insufficient time to prepare his case and was prevented from consulting his supervising attorney as required by APR 9. Id. at BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 10 215. In addition, the Court of Appeals, sua sponte, questioned whether representation of an indigent defendant by a law student, without the presence of a supervising attorney in court, constituted a per se violation of the right to counsel. Id. This Court first addressed the constitutional challenge to representation by rule 9 interns. In doing so, it reminded the legal community that it has the constitutionally granted power to determine who may appear before the bar, and that this power is both "well established" and "involate." Id. at 215. Pursuant to this power, this Court promulgated and adopted the Admission to Practice Rules including APR 9, which allows "lesser qualified persons to engage in limited practice." Id. at 216. Next, this Court explained that rule 9 has several requirements, including completion of at least two-thirds of the prescribed study at an approved law school, maintenance of good academic standing, and supervision by a qualified licensed attorney. Id. Additionally, rule 9 contains specific rules outlining the conditions under which an intern may try cases without a supervisor present. Id. Thus, this Court concluded, [a]lthough a legal intern is not an attorney, this court has established safeguards sufficient to assure that persons attaining rule 9 status will be competent to serve the needs of their clients. In light of this court's authority to determine which persons may practice in Washington state courts, and in light of the rules this BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 11 court has promulgated to assure that persons so practicing are qualified, we have held that there is no per se impropriety in allowing legal interns to appear in criminal proceedings. We now hold that these same safeguards are sufficient to meet the constitutional requirements of counsel. Id. at 216-217.Ultimately, this Court concluded that when rule 9 is complied with, a criminal defendant receives legal assistance "sufficient to meet with both state and federal constitutions." Id. at 218. This Court then turned to the facts of the defendant's case. Whereas a law student acting in compliance with rule 9 does qualify as counsel for sixth amendment purposes, this Court held, "representation by a law student intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal." Id. at 19 (emphasis added), citing Cheatham v. State, 364 So.2d 83, 84 {Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (failure to comply with requirements that supervising attorney be present and defendant be informed of student status); In re Moore, 63 III.App.3d 899, 904 (1978) (failure to inform court of student status and failure to obtain defendant's written consent); cf. People v. Masonis, 58 Mich.App. 615, 619 (1975) (/aw student representation did not violate right to counsel where defendant was aware of student status, general effective assistance of counsel standards were met, and there was no BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 12 violation of student practice rules). Additionally, the Court held that where counsel is outright denied, no prejudice need be shown. Id. at 220, citing People v. Felder,4 7 N.Y.2d 287, 294 (1979) ( defendants were denied effective assistance of counsel where each defendant was represented in his underlying criminal action by a person who had not completed law school and who was not, and had never been, admitted to the Bar of the State or of any other jurisdiction). Because the record demonstrated that the law student representing the defendant was prevented from complying with the requirements of APR 9 which would have otherwise qualified him as counsel, this Court held that there was a denial of the "in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 213. The Court of Appeals decision in this case does not conflict with Ratliff because the holding of Ratliff is restricted to law students practicing under APR 9 or, at the very least, representation by individuals who have never completed law school or been licensed as an attorney in any jurisdiction. In Ratliff, the question before this Court was whether a rule 9 intern, who had never been admitted to practice in any jurisdiction, could ever qualify as counsel for constitutional purposes and, if so, the conditions required for doing so. This reading is supported by the cases cited by this Court in reaching its conclusions, a majority of BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 13 which discuss the practice of law by student interns in other states. Furthermore, the Defendant's argument that the Court of Appeal's decision in his case interfere's with this Court's ability to regulate the practice of law in Washington state is misplaced. Ratliff's discussion of this Court's power to regulate the practice of law is oriented towards this Court's constitutional power to decide when an individual may affirmatively be admitted to practice in Washington state. It does not necessarily follow that, in every case where an individuaf is represented by counsel out of compliance with the APRs, there is an per se denial of counsel. Absent the requirements of rule 9, a legal intern is comparable to a lay person because they have never been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction and, in many cases, have not yet completed their legal studies. By contrast, an attorney admissible pro hac vice under APR 8, while not licensed in Washington state, has completed their legal studies and qualified as an attorney in at least one jurisdiction. See APR 8(b).5 Even if that attorney were to later fail to comply with the requirements of APR 8, he would still have legal training and specialized knowledge necessary to ensure a fair trial. 5The irony is inescapable that this issue has been raised in an era where this Court suspended the bar exam and admitted over 500 law school graduates under diploma privilege. See https://news. bloomberglaw .com/business-and-practice/over-1-000-new-lawyers-get-licenses-without-taking-bar-exam. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 14 The issue raised here is not whether Mr. Van !dour was admitted to practice in Washington, but rather what the remedy should be when he failed to comply with the APRs but had the legal knowledge and skills necessary to provide competent representation. 6 Because the holding of Ratliff is so restricted, it fits within the same legal framework applied in Defendant's case. As discussed above, courts draw a distinction between deprivation of counsel claims where the defendant's representative is not qualified to practice law in any jurisdiction, and those where the representative is qualified to practice in at least one jurisdiction, but not the jurisdiction where the representation occurred. In Ratliff, the otherwise unlicensed law student intern was prevented from complying with the requirements of rule 9, and therefore was not qualified to practice in any jurisdiction. Thus, this Court appropriately declared the law student's representation a per se violation of the right to counsel. In the Petitoner's matter, the Court of Appeals correctly identified a distinguishing fact-that Mr. Van ldour, at the time of his representation, was qualified to practice in at least one jurisdiction- and appropriately required the Defendant 6lt is worth noting that, outside the per se violation of the right to counsel argument, the Defendant does not argue that Mr. Van ldour's representation prejudiced him in any way. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 15 to demonstrate prejudice. II.THE COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION DOES NOT REPRESENT A MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.As discussed above, the Court of Appeals merely applied . existing law to reach its decision in the Defendant's matter. Furthermore, it did so in a manner not inconsistent with this Court's holding in Ratliff. As such, the Court of Appeals decision does not alter the public's right to counsel. Because of this, the Defendant's case does not represent a matter of public interest and review on that ground should be denied. Ill. THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT DEFENDANT AND AMICUS'S CLAIMS THAT EITHER THE COURT OR THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WERE COMPLICIT IN MR.VAN IDOUR'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE APR'S.In his brief, Defendant claims that the presiding judge in his case became aware that Mr. Van !dour had not been admitted to practice in Washington and attempted to cover up this fact. Brief of Petitioner at 2. He later includes a section in his brief questioning why the prosecutor's office did not suspect Mr. Van ldour's qualifications and suggesting that the State breached its duty as a representative of the people. Id. at 11-13. Amicus ACLU joins in this argument, alleging that the trial court and prosecutor's office "facilitated" Mr. Van ldour's actions. Memorandum of Amicus BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 16 Curiae ACLU of Washington at 7. Both parties claims that then-judge Galina covered up Mr. Van ldour's actions are unsupported by the record. Similarly, the claims regarding the prosecutor's office are unfounded. The State was not privy to Mr. Van ldour's licensing status, and believed that Mr. Van ldour was practicing under APR 8 per the trial court's order. It was not until Mr. Van ldour's cases were reassigned that the State became aware of the issue. V.CONCLUSION The Court of Appeals decision in the Defendant's case neither conflicts with this Court's decision in Ratliff nor involves an issue of substantial public interest. Because no basis for review exists, the State respectfully requests that the Defendant's Petition for Review be denied. Dated this l'fl~ day of August, 2021 .

II.ARGUMENT A.DESPITE IRREGULARITIES WITH REGARD TO TRIAL COUNSEL'S LICENSURE, THE PETITIONER WAS NOT DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL WHERE TRIAL COUNSEL WAS A LICENSED ATTORNEY IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE IDAHO STATE BAR.BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 1 Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Petitioner was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. See State v. Justin C.Lewis, 35775-9-111, 2019 WL 1568058 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019)(Unpublished)(attached hereto).1 The underlying facts of the case are largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. Those facts pertinent to the issues raised, which this Court specifically reque·sted that the State address, are recited herein. The Petitioner was represented by attorney Robert Van ldour throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order (04/05/17) (attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour was, and is still currently, a licensed member of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and was assigned, at that time, to provide public defense, on contract under APR 8( c ). Declaration of Robert J.Van I dour ( attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had arranged to practice under APR 8(c), which authorizes attorneys who are li~ensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in Washington. DeclarationofRobertJ.Van ldour, DeclarationofVivian .eJy, (attached hereto). Prior to contracting with Mr. Van ldour, the 1T he State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 2 Board of County Commissioners inquired of the Superior Court Judge, Scott Gallina, regarding Mr. Van ldour's qualifications to contract for public defense without being licensed in Washington. Declaration of Vivian Bly. Judge Gallina confirmed that Mr. Van ldour would be eligible through APR 8(c) process to perform duties under a contract while he applied for admission to the Washington State Bar. Throughout the process, the Superior Court Administrator made periodic efforts to contact the Washington State Bar Association to confirm that Mr. Van ldour's application was pending and processing. Declaration ofTammyTenny.(attached hereto). On October 26, 2017, the Court was notified via email that Mr. Van ldour's application for admission had been approved. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. In October of 2017, Mr. Van ldour indicated he needed a formal order from the Court which was provided, memorializing his acceptance by the Court as indigent defense counsel dated October 6, 2017, nuncpro tune to February 1, 201 7. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Not until January 31 , 2018, did the Court receive any information that there was any problem with Mr. Van ldour's application to practice under APR 8(c).2 The Court immediately instructed Mr. Van ldour to arrange to transfer his cases to other 2 For what it's worth, the Asotin County Prosecutor's office did not become aware of any irregularities concerning Mr. Van ldour's eligibility to represent indigent defendants until the Court assigned new counsel to Mr. Van ldour's cases in February of 2018. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 3 attorneys. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. Subsequently, the Court received a letter dated February 13, 2018, indicating Mr. Van ldour was not authorized to practice in Washington courts. Declaration of Tammy Tenny. The Petitioner, who was convicted on October 31, 2017 and sentenced on November 7, 2017, appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, supra. The Petitioner then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging only that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington. The Defendant does not argue, nor does he make any showing that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor does he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. IV.DISCUSSION RAP 16.11(b) authorizes dismissal of the petition if the petition is clearly without merit. The Respondent submits that the issues raised by the Petitioner are without merit and lack any basis in fact or in the law. A PRP is not a substitute for a direct appeal. In re Pers. Restraint of Hagler, 97 Wn.2d 818, 824, 650 P.2d 1103 (1982). Courts are reluctant to overturn a settled judicial decision where the Petitioner has had an opportunity for direct appellate review. In re Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 676, 327 P. 3d 660 (2014 ). BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 4 Therefore, there are limitations on the use of a PRP to collaterally attack a conviction. Hagler, 97 Wn.2d at 824. A personal restraint petition must state with particularity the factual allegations which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. In re Pers. Restraint of Rice, 118 Wn.2d 876, 886, 828 P.2d 1086 (1992). Factual allegations must be supported by evidence. 118 Wn.2d at 886. If the record does not support the factual allegations, then the petitioner must show through affidavits or other forms of corroboration that competent and admissible evidence will establish the factual allegations. 118 Wn.2d at 886. Bald assertions and conclusory allegations are not sufficient. Id. To be entitled to collateral relief through a PRP the Petitioner must prove the existence of error by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Pers. Restraint of Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479, 490, 251 P. 3d 884 (Div. II, 2010). Assuming error can be shown, he is also required to prove prejudice. Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 676. The significance of the level of prejudice depends on the type of error shown. Id. To be entitled to relief for a constitutional error, a petitioner must also prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "actual and substantial prejudice." Id. (Emphasis added). This prejudice "must be determined in light of the totality of circumstances," and exists only if the error "so infected petitioner' s BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 5 entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process." In re Pers. Restraint of Music, 104 Wn.2d 189, 191, 704 P.2d 144 ('1985). To be entitled to relief for a nonconstitutional error, a petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "a fundamental defect resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice." In re Pers. Restraint of Elmore, 162 Wn.2d 236, 251, 172 P.3d 335 (2007) (emphasis added). With this as the backdrop, the State will respond to the issue raised. A.DESPITE IRREGULARITIES.WITH REGARD TO TRIAL COUNSEL'S LICENSURE, THE PETITIONER WAS NOT DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL WHERE TRIAL COUNSEL WAS A LICENSED ATTORNEY IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE IDAHO STATE BAR.The Petitioner bases his entire claim on the fact that his trial counsel, Robert Van ldour, was not licensed in Washington State. It is beyond dispute that Mr. Van ldour was not licenced with the Washington State Bar. It is, however, important to note that much of the information now contained in the Bar Association's complaint against Mr. Van ldour was unknown to either Asotin County or the trial court. On advice from the Superior Court Judge, the County entered into a contract with Mr. Van ldour, who had decades of experience representing criminal defendants. The picture painted by the Petitioner of a system which was cavalier with regard to the Petitioner's right to counsel is not accurate. The Petitioner was BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 6 represented by a veteran and capable attorney throughout the process, despite the subsequent revelations regarding counsel's failure to obtain licensure. There can be no question that a criminal defendant has the right to effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, 672, 101 P.3d 1 (2004). Where a defendant is denied counsel because the "attorney" was not licensed in any state, prejudice may be presumed. See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 474 {S.D.N.Y. 1992), affd, 2 F.3d 403 {2d Cir. 1993). However, this per se rule does not apply where the attorney is licensed to practice but merely lacks a license in the jurisdiction where the case occurs. Id. The Petitioner's reliance on Solina is misplaced. As explained in Ferrara: In support of his position, petitioner looks to the holding of Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir.1983), where the court found that a per se violation of the right to counsel had occurred where the defendant's counsel had repeatedly failed the New York bar examination and was not a member of any bar. Here, however, [trial counsel] had been a member of the New Jersey bar for more than 30 years and was well familiarized with general criminal procedure because of his years spent as a county prosecutor. Ferrara, at 47 4. Here, Mr. Van ldour was licensed (for more than 30 years) in Idaho, having handled hundreds of criminal defense cases. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 7 Even assuming that his qualifications under APR 8(c) were lacking, he was an attorney licensed to practice. As a result, there was no per se deprivation of counsel because Mr. Van ldour was licensed to practice in Idaho, and the Petitioner must therefore make a further showing under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed. 2d 674 (1984). To establish that the right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated, the Petitioner must make two showings: that counsel's representation was deficient and that counsel's deficient representation caused prejudice. Ferrara, at 474 (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 687). The Petitioner makes no showing that Mr. Van ldour was ineffective or that but for any deficient performance, the outcome would have been different. First, the Petitioner points to no action or inaction on the part of Mr. Van ldour that would constitute deficient performance. Further, the Petitioner, as evidenced by his failure to aver otherwise, cannot point to any scintilla of prejudice suffered as a result of any act or omission on the part of Mr. Van ldour. The Petitioner's sole claim rests on the lack of a license to practice law in Washington. Because Mr. Van ldour was an attorney and licensed by another state, the Petitioner's per se claim of deprivation of the right to an attorney fails. He further fails to demonstrate His claim therefore necessarily fails. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 8 V.CONCLUSION In summary, the petition filed in this matter, based upon the record, is without merit. In the best interests of justice this petition should be dismissed. The Respondent respectfully requests that this Court enter an order dismissing Petitioner's Personal Restraint Petition pursuant to RAP 16.11 (b ). Dated this_ day of August, 2021.
