WHETHER A PETITIONER WHO WAS REPRESENTED BY A PERSON ADMITTED TO PRACTICE LAW IN A NEIGHBORING STATE MUST DEMONSTRATED ACTUAL PREJUDICE IN A COLLATERAL ATTACK BASED UPON THE OUT-OF-STATE ATTORNEY'S LICENSING STATUS IN WASHINGTON.BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 1 II.INTRODUCTION The Petitioners in this matter raise the issue of whether their right to counsel was violated when they were represented by Robert Van ldour, an attorney who was licensed in a neighboring state but not Washington. Because this issue is being raised for the first time in a post-conviction collateral attack, the Petitioners are required to demonstrate actual prejudice rather than a per se violation. Because they fail to do so, their Personal Restraint Petitions should be dismissed. Additionally, based on federal precedent, Mr. Van ldour qualified as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes at the time he represented Petitioners. Washington Courts have held that the Washington State Constitution provides the same protections as the United States Constitution on issues related to the right to counsel. Therefore, this Court should find that he also qualified as counsel under Washington law. Finally, Washington Courts have held that violation of BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 2 the Rules of Professional Conduct does not establish a per se violation of the right to counsel, and that the appropriate sanction is investigation and discipline by the Washington State Bar Counsel. This Court should stand by that well reasoned precedent here. Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE Robert L.Ayerst (Petitioner Ayerst) was convicted after jury trial of Attempted Burglary in the Second Degree, Malicious Mischief in the Second Degree, and Bail Jumping (C Felony), from events occurring September 6, 2016. See 35867-4-111, 2019 WL 1568060 (Div. Ill, Apr. 11 , 2019) (Unpublished). 1 The underlying facts of the case are largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. Justin C.Lewis (Petitioner Lewis) was convicted after jury trial of Assault in the First Degree, Robbery in the First Degree, Possession of a Controlled Substance (Heroin), 1The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 3 and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia from events occurring April 4, 201 7. See State v. Justin C.Lewis, 8 Wn.App. 1028 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019) {Unpublished).2 The underlying facts of the case are likewise immaterial and warrant no discussion. Petitioner Ayerst was initially represented by John Fay, who was later replaced by attorney Robert Van ldour who represented him through trial. See Bond Order (10/04/16) and Motion and Order Allowing Withdrawal and Substitution, submitted with the State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition. Petitioner Lewis was represented by attorney Mr. Van ldour throughout the proceeding from its origin. Bond Order (04/05/17) (see attached State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition and attached documents, attached hereto). Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had arranged to practice under APR 8(c), which authorizes 2The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 4 attorneys who are licensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in Washington. Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour. Mr. Van ldour also applied for formal admission to the Washington State Bar by motion under APR 3(c). See Personal Restraint Petition Appendix A.He was later notified that his application for admission by motion under APR 3(c) was accepted, and that his application for limited admission under APR 8(c) had been denied. Appendix A.At the time of his appointment, Mr. Van ldour had been an attorney, licensed in the State of Idaho for more than 30 year and was, at that time, 3 a member in good standing with the Idaho State Bar Association. Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour. Petitioner Ayerst appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion. 3 The Idaho Bar Association Website indicates Mr. Van ldour's status as "inactive" as of December 15, 2021. According to the WSBA webside, Mr. Van ldour was suspended by order of the Washington Supreme Court for eighteen months effective September 14, 2021. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 5 See State v. Ayerst,35867-4-11 I, 2019 WL 1568060. Petitioner Ayerst then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington. He has neither identified any deviation from the standard of practice for criminal defense lawyers in Washington, nor any prejudice therefrom. Petition·er Lewis appealed his conviction after trial, and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Lewis, supra. Petitioner Lewis then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging only that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington. Petitioner Lewis neither argued nor demonstrated that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor did he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. In an unpublished decision, the Division Three of the Court of Appeals dismissed the BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 6 Defendant's PRP, finding that 1) Petitioner Lewis failed to allege he was prejudiced by his attorney's representation and 2) the facts set forth in his petition failed to establish that he should be excused from showing prejudice based on a theory of structural error. Matter of Lewis, 37284-7-111, 2021 WL 1750935 (Div. 111, May 4, 2021) (unpublished). 4 In a published decision, Division Three of the Court of Appeals dismissed Petitioner Ayerst's petition, finding that 1) the facts set forth in his petition failed to establish that he should be excused from showing prejudice based on a theory of structural error and Petitioner Ayerst failed to allege that he was prejudiced by his attorney's representation. see Matter of Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d 356 (2021 ). Petitioners Ayerst and Lewis both separately sought review by this Court of the Court of Appeals' decision which was granted, solely on the issue regarding the right to 4 The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 7 counsel, and the matters consolidated for consideration. IV.ARGUMENT A collateral attack is not a substitute for a direct appeal. The Washington State Constitution draws a distinction between direct appeals fo criminal convictions and habeas corpus actions. Const. art. 1. §§ 13, 22. Specifically, collateral, attacks are generally held to a heightened standard to protect the principle of finality. In re Pers. Restraint of Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 115, 120 (2014). Additionally, in a collateral post-conviction proceeding, the Petitioner bears the burden rather than the State. In re Pers. Restraint of Sandoval, 189 Wn.2d 811 , 821 (2018). "[A] personal restraint petitioner must first establish by preponderance of the evidence that a constitutional error has resulted in actual and substantial prejudice." In re Pers. Restaint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 671 (2014) (internal citations omitted). A constitutional error alone does not generally meet the requisite prejudice. State v. Buckman, 190 Wn.2d 51, BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 8 56 n.1 (2018). Thus, an error creating the possibility of prejudice is insufficient-the petition must show that "the outcome would more likely than not have been different had the alleged error not occurred." In re Pers. Restraint of · Meippen, 193 Wn.2d 310 (2019) (internal citations omitted). "Although some errors which result prejudice on direct review will also be per se prejudicial on collateral attack, the interests of finality of litigation demand that a higher standard be satisfied in a collateral proceeding." In the Matter of the Personal Restraint of St. Pierre, 118 Wn.2d 321, 329 (1992). Since the decision in St. Pierre, this Court has applied this higher standard for collateral attacks to court closures, an otherwise structural error. See In re Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 115, 121-22 (2014).5 If a petitioner fails to make the required "prima facie 5At least one amicus brief cites to In re Crace for the proposition that the higher standard for collateral attacks does not apply ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 17 4 Wn.2d 835. However, the holding of In re Crace suggests only that a petitioner in a collateral attack need not show additional prejudice beyond the requirements of Strickland v. Washington. Id. at 848. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 9 showing of actual and substantial" prejudice, the result is dismissal of the collateral attack. In re Meippen, 193 Wn.2d at 316. Furthermore, in a collateral attack, the burden is on the petitioner to identify and, when available, produce the necessary record to support the claim. A petitioner who raises a claim is required to have some factual basis to support it and point the court to where those facts are being drawn from. In re Pers. Restraint of Cook, 114 Wn.2d 802, 813-14 (1990); see also RAP 16.7 (a)(2)-(3). Unsupported allegations lacking citations to authority or references to the record or to competent admissible evidence are not sufficient to sustain the petitioner's burden. In re Cook, 114 Wn.2d at 813-14. Failure to meet this burde results in dismissal of the petition. Petition of Williams, 111 Wn.2d 353, 364-65 (1998). Here, the Petitioners do not argue that they were prejudiced by Mr. Van ldour's representation. They do not identify any deficiencies in Mr. Van ldour's representation of them Rather, the Petitioners assert that representation by BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 10 Mr. Van !dour constituted a per se violation of their constitutional right to counsel. Petition for Review from Division Three of the Court of Appeals #369650-111 at 7; Petition for Review from Division Three of the Court of Appeals #37284-7-111 at 2. In doing so, they rely heavily on the holding of City of Seattle vs. Ratliff. 100 Wn.2d 212 (1983). However, Ratliff was decided on direct appeal. Assuming, arguendo, that the holding of Ratliff applies to attorneys licensed outside of Washington State1 that case was decided under a different standard. The Petitioners have raised this issue for the first time as part of a post conviction collateral attack; therefore, a demonstration of prejudice is.required. Withoutanyevidenceofprejudice, the Personal Restraint Petitions should be dismissed. A criminal defendant unquestionably has the right to effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 22 of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 6471 672 (2004). BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 11 To sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must demonstrate that (1) counsel's representation was deficient and (2) that counsel's deficient representation caused prejudice. Id. ( quoting State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35 (1995)). Here, Petitioners claim that their respective Sixth Amendment and Article I, Section 22 rights were violated. This Court has routinely held that Article I, Section 22 is no more protective than the Sixth Amendment and neither Petitioner has argued or offered analysis suggesting otherwise. State v. Moore, 79 Wn.2d 51 (1971 ); State v. Earls, 116 Wn.2d 364, 375 (1991); State v. Hager, 171 Wn.2d 151, (2011); State v. Mayer, 184 Wn.2d 548, 569 ("The right to counsel under our state constitution and the federal constitution is the same.") On direct appeal, courts have found complete deprivation of counsel to have occurred where the purported "counsel" has never been duly licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction. United States v. Novak, 903 BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 12 F.2d 883, 890 (2d. Cir. 1990). This finding is limited to instances where counsel has failed to ever meet the substantive requirements to practice law. See Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983) (counsel repeatedly failed the bar exam and was not licensed in any jurisdiction); See also People v. Felder. 47 N.Y.2d 287, 391 N.E.2d 1274 (1979) (counsel had never attended law school or otherwise satisfied the prerequisites for bar admission, and had never been licensed in any jurisdiction); See also Novak, 903 F.2d 883 (2d. Cir. 1990) (counsel had never taken the bar exam and received admission to the bar through fraudulent means). Conversely, courts have held that the Sixth Amendment right to "counsel" is satisfied when a defendant is represented by someone who is authorized to practice law rather than a lay person. See State v. S.M., 100 Wn. App. 401 , 410 (2000) (quoting United States v. Gismore, 546 F.2d 844, 847 (10th Cir. 1976)). In other words, a defendant who is represented by a person who has been BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 13 licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction has not suffered from a per se Sixth Amendment violation. See, e.g.,United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 11 26, 1132 (D.C.Cir. 2000) ('We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se ineffectiveness rule beyond those cases in which a defendant is represented by a person never properly admitted to any bar.'); United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir. 1998) (''the key to adequate representation is not technical license to practice in the jurisdiction involved, but a credential from some forum demonstrating the specialized knowledge of a lawyer.'). Specifically, various federal and state courts have addressed cases where the defendant was represented by an out-of-state attorney who had not been admitted pro hoc vice. See, e.g., Cole v. United States, 162 F.3d 957, 959 (7th Cir. 1998); Kieserv. New York, 56 F.3d 16, 17 (2d Cir. 1995) (lawyer suspended in New Jersey and not admitted pro hac vice in New York when case was tried); United States v. Costanzo, 740 F.2d 251, 258-59 (3d Cir. 1984); BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 14 Derringer v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1141 (8th Cir. 1971 ). For instance, in Ferrara v. Keane, trial counsel was licensed to practice in New Jersey, but not in New York where the proceedings took place. 806 F.Supp. 472, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). In deciding Petitioner's ineffective assistance counsel claim, the court concluded that because counsel was admitted in another jurisdiction for more than 30 years, it could not be said that he failed to meet the "substantive requirements" for the practice of law. Id. at 474. Where counsel would have been eligible for limited admission to practice in the forum court, but failed to make a formal application, the representation provided is not automatically ineffective. United States v. Bradford, 238 F.2d 395 (2d. Cir. 1956) ( counsel who failed to comply with court rule for limited admission was not automatically ineffective); see also Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. at 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (even assuming counsel's petition to proceed pro hac vice BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 15 was flawed, defendant was required to show prejudice). Even the disbarment of counsel during trial proceedings is insufficient to find complete deprivation of cousel. United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682,698 (9th Cir. 1986). In Mouzin, defense counsel was notified during trial that he had been disbarred by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Id. at 694-95. Pursuant to local rule, disbarment in any jurisdiction resulted in disbarment from the trial court. Id. at 695. Counsel, with consent of the trial judge, continued to represent the defendant through trial. Id. On review, the Ninth Circuit concluded that even an automatic disbarment from the trial court was insufficient to render counsel's representation ineffective. Id. at 698. Similarly, representation by a lawyer whose license has been suspended does not constitute a complete deprivation of counsel. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 479 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir.) (suspension of a state license not per se ineffective assistance of counsel); Hardaman v. United States, 319 F.3d 943, 951 (7th Cir. 2003) BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 16 (suspension of an attorney does not amount to per se ineffective assistance); State v. Edison, 61 Wn. App. ( 1991) ( defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice when represented by a lawyer who has been licensed but whose license was suspended). Here, Mr. Van ldour was licensed to practice law in another jurisdiction, and had been for 30 years. Even if the requirements of APR 8 were not satisfied, it cannot be said Mr. Van ldour failed to ever meet the "substantive requirements" to practice law.6 Furthermore, during the course of his representation of Petitioner, Mr. Van ldour 6 Interestingly and by contrast, an entire class of bar · applicants was recently granted admission due to COVID-19, having never demonstrated fitness to practice law through the usual screening process of the bar examination. Unlike these applicants, Mr. Van ldour had successfully passed a bar exam and his three decades practice without disciplinary action attest to his fitness, even where he failed to fill out all necessary paperwork and follow through with his reciprocal application process with the WSBA, for which he was undoubtably otherwise eligible."Over 1000 New Lawyers Get Licenses Without Taking Bar Exam," Bloomburg Law, Jan. 4, 2021, https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/ov er-1-000-new-lawyers-get-licenses-without-taking-bar-exa m BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 17 remained a licensed attorney in good standing in Idaho. If formal disbarment during trial does not constitute a deprivation of counsel, certainly representation by a licensed attorney in good standing cannot meet the requisite standard. Furthermore, Mr. Van ldourwas eligible for reciprocal admission. Moreover, he could have practiced pro hac vice in any court in Washington, with permission of that court, and he was certainly eligible to provide public defense under APR 8. His only deficiency was his failure to be mindful of and properly follow the strictures of that rule. Where suspension or even outright disbarment does not violate the 6th Amendment right to counsel, this deficiency, while not an insignificant barrier to the lawful and regulated practice of law, cannot be said to have amounted to an absolute deprivation of counsel. Finally, Petitioners and amici emphasize the fact that Mr. Van ldour's failure to obtain a Washington license violated the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), including BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 18 the Standards for Indigent Defense. However, this Court has determined that, while they may be used to evaluate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the "professional standards do not establish minimum Sixth Amendment requirements." State v. A.N.J, 168 Wn.2d 91, 965-66 (2010). Furthermore, Washington Courts have declined to find that defense counsel provided ineffective based solely on counsel's violation of the Standards for Indigent Defense (SID). State v. Flores, 197 Wn.App. 1, 15 (Div. Ill, 2016), review denied in 188 Wn.2d 1003. In addressing the lack of remedy for violations of the SID, the Court found that "[t]he omission suggests that the remedy for violations of the standards rests with the disciplinary process." Id. at 15. The Court then stated that "[w]hether there was a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is a question that only an appropriate investigation can answer'' and declined to issue an opinion on the matter. Id. at 15-16. Similarly to the Appellant in Flores, the Petitioners emphasize Mr. Van ldour's violation of the RPC and SID in BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 19 arguing that his representation was deficient under the Sixth Amendment. Amicus The Defender Initiative also suggests that "[rJeversing the convictions in this case will make it clear that the court intends to enforce the Standards it adopted." However, this Court has already determined that an appropriate remedy exists-an investigation by the bar counsel and, if a violation is found to have been committed, disciplinary action by the same. This Court should stand by its well-reasoned precedent. V.CONCLUSION Without any showing of prejudice resulting from Mr. Van ldour's representation, the Petitioners fail to meet the heightened requirements for a post conviction collateral attack. Furthermore, Mr. Van ldour's representation qualified as "counsel" for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment and, by extension, the Washington State Constitution.
