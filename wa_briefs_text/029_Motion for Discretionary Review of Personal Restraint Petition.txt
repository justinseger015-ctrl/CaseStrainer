A.Idaho Bar Association Search……………………………………B vi A.IDENTITY OF PETITIONER Robert Ayerst asks this court to accept review of the decision designated in Part B.B. COURT OF APPEALS DECISION Robert Ayerst seeks reversal of his Asotin County judgment and sentence, 16-1-00150-7 and of the Court of Appeals decision ruling against his personal restraint petition. A copy of the Court of Appeals decision is attached. (PRP of Ayerst, No. 36965-0-III). (Appendix B) (attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference). C.ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 1. The decision from the Court of Appeals denying Mr. Ayerst’s violation of the constitutional right to counsel based on representation by Robert Van Idour who was never authorized to practice law in Washington conflicts with this Court’s decision in City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 217, 687 P.2d 630 (1983) and raises an issue of substantial public importance, that violates constitution protections. 2. When a trial judge is removed from the bench after arrest on charges of sexual assault and rape against his staff, and when the judge knowingly alters a document to facilitate the illegal practice Appendix—Petition for Review—1 of law by an attorney not licensed to practice in Washington, the appearance of fairness is violated, and this creates an unconstitutional risk of bias. D.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The substantive facts related to the underlying charges are not relevant to the issues raised in this Motion Petition Review. Mr. Ayerst’s trial counsel, Robert Van Idour was never authorized to practice law in Washington State despite alleging he was authorized under APR 8. Personal Restraint Petition of Robert Ayerst. Mr. Van Idour is no longer licensed to practice in Idaho. See Appendix B (attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein). The presiding judge at Mr. Ayerst’s trial was former Asotin County Superior Court Judge Scott Galina. Judge Gallina was aware of Mr. Van Idour’s lack of legal qualifications to practice in Washington and issued an order that purported to permit Mr. Van Idour to practice in Washington without a Washington State license. Judge Gallina was arrested roughly a year after Mr. Ayerst’s trial and charged with second degree rape, indecent liberties, and assault in the third degree with sexual motivation based on allegations of sexual misconduct made by multiple members of his Appendix—Petition for Review—2 judicial staff. See State of Washington v. Scott D.Gallina, Asotin County Superior Court Case 19-1-00066-02. Division Three of the Washington State Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Ayerst’s convictions and sentence following a direct appeal. State v. Ayerst, 8 Wn. App. 2d 1028. Division Three of the Washington State Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Ayerst’s arguments filed in his PRP requesting relief based on former Judge Gallina’s arrest and prosecution, as well as ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Van Idour was never licensed to practice law in Washington. E.ARGUMENT WHY REVIEW SHOULD BE ACCEPTED. 1. UNDER SEATTLE V.RATLIFF, WHEN THE PERSON ASSIGNED TO REPRESENT AN INDIGENT DEFENDANT IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO PRACTICE LAW IN WASHINGTON STATE, IT IS A PER SE VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO COUNSEL. a. Procedural Posture Mr. Ayerst seeks review under RAP 16.14(c) and RAP 13.5A(a)(1), considering the criteria set forth in RAP 13.4(b)(1), (3), (4). The decision of the Court of Appeals: is in conflict with this Court’s decision in City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 217, 687 P.2d 630 (1983); it involves denial of the right to counsel under both Washington State Const. art. 1, § 22 and the Sixth Amendment; and Appendix—Petition for Review—3 it attempts to reduce the protections afforded all citizens of the state of Washington and therefore is a matter of substantial public interest that should be determined by this court. RAP 13.4(b)(1), (3), (4). b. Constitutional Right to Counsel The U.S.Const. Amends. 6 and 14, and Washington State Const. art. I, § 22 (amend 10) provide the equivalent right to appointed counsel. U.S. v. Bryant, 136 S.Ct. 1954 (2016); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed. 2d 799 (1963); State v. Johnson, 179 Wn.2d 534, 315 P.3d 1090 (2014), cert. denied, 135 S.Ct. 139, 190 L.Ed. 2d 105 (2014). The purpose of this right is to guarantee all defendants the right to a fair trial. Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 158-59, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed. 2d 140 (1988). c. State Supreme Court Has Exclusive Authority to Regulate Practice of Law: Ratliff Controls. Subject to the minimum protections afforded under the Due Process clause, the Federal Constitution does not have the authority to interfere with the state’s broad power to regulate the practice of law. Brotherhood of R.R. v. Virginia ex rel Va. State Bar, 377 U.S. 1, 6, 84 S.Ct. 1113, 12 L.Ed. 2d 89 (1964); Schware v. Board of Bar Exam. Of State of N.M., 353 U.S. 232, 238-39, 77 S.Ct. 752, 1 L.Appendix—Petition for Review—4 Ed. 2d 796 (1957)1; Clark v. Washington, 366 F.2d 678, 680-81 (9th Cir.1966); In re Bruen, 102 Wn.2d 472, 476, 172 P. 1152 (1918). Const. art. 4, § 1 vests judicial power of the state in the Supreme Court to the “exclusive, inherent power to admit, enroll, discipline, and disbar attorneys.” Short v. Demopolis, 103 Wn.2d 52, 62, 691 P.2d 163 (1984). Accordingly, only this Court determines who may or may not appear in Washington State courts. State v. Yismael, 195 Wn.2d 155, 160, 456 P.3d 1172 (2020); Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215; Const. art. 4, § 1. The formulation of rules governing admission to practice is a judicial function inherent in this constitutionally granted power. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215;2 Chism v. Tri-State Const., Inc. 193 Wn. App. 818, 203-04, 374 P.3d 193 (2016). Exercise of “this power is necessary for the protection of the court, the proper administration of justice, the dignity and purity of the profession, and for the public good and the protection of clients.” In re Bruen, 102 Wash. 472, 475, 172 P. 1152 (1918). 1 Article IV, § 2, of the Constitution treats the practice of law as a “privilege. 2 In re Levy, 23 Wn.2d 607, 161 P.2d 651, 162 A.L.R. 805 (1945). See also Hagan & Van Camp, P.S. v. Kassler Escrow, Inc., 96 Wn.2d 443, 635 P.2d 730 (1981); In re Schatz, 80 Wash.2d 604, 497 P.2d 153 (1972); State ex rel. Laughlin v. Washington State Bar Ass'n, 26 Wn.2d 914, 176 P.2d 301 (1947); Clark v. Washington, 366 F.2d 678 (9th Cir.1966). Appendix—Petition for Review—5 The court's power to regulate the practice of law in this state is inviolate. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215; Eugster v. Washington State Bar Ass'n, 198 Wn. App. 758, 775, 397 P.3d 131 (2017). The Legislature enacted RCW 2.48, establishing the State Bar Association (WSBA) under the authority of the State Supreme Court to exclusively regulate the admission to practice of law Washington. State v. Cook, 84 Wn.2d 342, 345, 525 P.2d 761 (1974); RCW 2.48.060; Admission to Practice Rules (APR) 1. 3. The Supreme, promulgated and adopted the Admission to Practice Rules (APR). The APRs are designed to protect the public by ensuring the competent practice of law. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 216; APR 1(a). For attorney’s licensed in other states who wish to appear in Washington to provide indigent representation, APR 8(c) provides the exclusive criteria for practice. First, the attorney must be in good standing in the state where he is licensed; second, he must associate with an active member of the Washington State Bar who “shall be the lawyer of record”; third, he must be deemed of good moral character fit to practice in Washington, and fourth, the “applicant shall either apply for and take 3 Since the inception of the legal system in our country adopted from England, A person seeking to appear in court has always been required to seek the permission of the state court. Appendix—Petition for Review—6 the first available lawyer bar examination after the date the applicant was granted authorization to practice under this rule. APR 8(c); Accord, Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) 5.5.APR 8(c), further provides that indigent defendants shall be represented by someone who has proven themselves proficient in Washington law. Id. If the person representing an indigent defendant fails to comply with these conditions, regardless of how long he or she has been practicing in another state, that person is not considered “counsel” for constitutional purposes. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218-19. Mr. Van Idour did not comply with APR 8(c); he was never “counsel” under state law; and when this occurs, such as here, it results in a complete denial of counsel, and no showing of prejudice need be made. Id. “Counsel” as used in Const. art. 1, § 22 and Sixth Amendment includes only those persons licensed to practice law as authorized by the Washington Supreme to practice law in this State. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217.4 The terms “lawyer,” “counsel,” and 4 Under the Sixth Amendment, counsel must be licensed. However, following the revolution in this Country, each state determines the minimum qualifications for practice which vary widely between the states. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217 (citing, Turner v. American Bar Ass’n., 407 F.Supp 451, 474 (1975) (no right to lay counsel) (citing, Friedman, A History of American Law (1973), pp. 276-277)). Appendix—Petition for Review—7 “attorney” have the same meaning. Black’s Law Dictionary 314, 799 (5th ed. 1979). In Ratliff, this court considered APR 9 governing representation by a legal intern. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 213. The trial court denied the unsupervised law student's request to continue the case, prevented him from consulting with a supervising attorney, and proceeded with trial with the intern representing the defendant. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 213. The Supreme Court of Washington determined that because the law student was unsupervised during the trial in violation of APR 9, the defendant was deprived of the right to counsel. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217-19. The Court explained that only persons authorized by the courts to practice law in the state qualified as “counsel” for constitutional purposes under both the state and federal constitutions. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217. “Although one who is authorized to practice only under certain conditions, such as a legal intern, may be considered “counsel” for constitutional purposes, this is so only when he or she complies with ---those conditions.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218 (emphasis in original); APR 1, 3, 8. The Court held that when a person does not comply with conditions required to practice law in this State, it is an “absolute Appendix—Petition for Review—8 denial of the right to counsel.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. As such, prejudice need not be established before relief one can obtain relief from judgment. Id. In Ratliff, the Supreme Court did not limit its holding to the context of legal interns, but rather held more broadly that to be considered “counsel” for constitutional purposes in Washington, one must be authorized by this Court under the APR’s, and comply with the mandatory provisions for limited practice. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218. While this case involves the conditions to practice as set forth in APR 8(c) instead of APR 9, Ratliff applies based on the Court in Ratliff’s analysis that our State Supreme Court has the exclusive authority to determine who is “authorized” to practice law in Washington. Const. art. 4, § 1; Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217-18; APR 8 and APR 9. This Court decided that it does not matter how much experience an attorney may have in another State to be authorized to practice law in Washington. Rather, he or she must comply with conditions set forth in APR 8. The Supreme Court’s holding in Ratliff, by its very terms, applies to anyone who appears in a Washington court to practice law in Washington, not just legal interns. Ratliff, 100 Appendix—Petition for Review—9 Wn.2d at 218. Ratliff, applies to this case and by its reasoning requires a remand for a new trial with an attorney authorized to practice in Washington. d. Federal Court’s Do Not Determine Who is “Counsel” in Washington. Decisions of the federal circuit courts on federal questions are not binding on the Washington Supreme Court. Home Ins. Co. of New York v. N.Pac. Ry. Co., 18 Wn.2d 798, 808, 140 P.2d 507 (1943); 21 C.J.S.Courts § 210. Moreover, once the Washington Supreme Court has interpreted a question of law, that interpretation is binding on all lower courts until that case is overruled. State v. Gore, 101 Wn.2d 481, 487, 681 P.2d 227 (1984); Godefroy v. Reilly, 146 Wash. 257, 259, 262 P. 639, 641 (1928). Ratliff is binding on all Washington Courts, and it does not require a showing of prejudice because “[d]enial of representation by one actually authorized to practice in court constitutes a denial of counsel, not merely ineffective assistance.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 220 (citing People v. Felder, 47 N.Y.2d 287, 294, 391 N.E.2d 1274, 418 N.Y.S.2d 295 (1979)). It is indisputable, that Mr. Van Idour was never authorized to practice law in Washington State Court. (Ayerst, Ayerst, supra, on Appendix—Petition for Review—10 reconsideration). Nonetheless, Division Three of the Court of Appeals in Mr. Ayerst’s case chose to ignore this Court’s exclusive authority in favor of impermissibly following the federal circuit court decision in Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 167 (2nd Cir. 1983). Ayerst, supra, slip op. at 5-6. It did so despite the fact that this Court decided Ratliff over two months after Solina, and reached a different conclusion, without consideration of Const. art. 4, § 1; Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215-18; APR 8 and APR 9. In Ayerst, Division Three impermissibly limited Ratliff’s holding to only those cases in which the appointed person is unlicensed in any state. Ayerst, supra, slip op. at 7. This decision conflicts with Ratliff which does not rest on whether an attorney is experienced or licensed outside Washington. Instead, it focuses on whether the person meets the mandatory qualifications established by this Court to be considered “counsel”. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218. 5 5 Although not necessary to address the merits of Mr. Ayerst’s case, as further evidence of Mr. Van Idour’s ineffective assistance of counsel, he filed an untimely notice of appeal after the 30 days-time line expired-on January 18, 2018, and Neil Cox, without ever being counsel of record filed the amended notice of appeal on February 13, 2018, almost 2 months after the date the judgment and sentence was entered on December 18, 2017. Mr. Cox also filed a motion for order of indigency on January 18, 2018, evidently because Mr. Van Idour failed to perform this task. Appendix—Petition for Review—11 Under APR 8, to be considered “counsel”, Mr. Van Idour was required but failed to establish himself knowledgeable as to Washington law by passing the Washington State Bar examination, or by associating with a Washington State licensed attorney of “record”. APR 8(c). Mr. Van Idour may have been licensed at some point to practice in Idaho, but he is no longer licensed to practice in Idaho, and he was never licensed or otherwise authorized to practice in Washington. Mr. Van Idour had no authority to represent Mr. Ayerst without associating with an active member of the Bar, who was the attorney of record, but no such attorney ever appeared on the record. APR 8. Mr. Ayerst was denied his constitutional right to counsel under Ratliff. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218. The Court of Appeals was required but did not to adhere to the binding precedence set forth in Ratliff and the conditions for practice under APR 8, despite any federal circuit decision to the contrary. Gore, 101 Wn.2d at, 487; Godefroy, 146 Wash. at 259. e. Prosecutor On Notice Mr. Van Idour proceeded from the time of his appointment through to sentencing without ever using a bar number as required under APR 13(a). Mr. Van Idour’s failure to use a bar number Appendix—Petition for Review—12 understandably would not have raised red flags for Mr. Ayerst: he is not an attorney. It is unclear why, through the course of this case, no red flags were raised for the prosecutor. The State fails to acknowledge its own duties as a representative of the people. Defendants are among the people the prosecutor represents. State v. Monday, 171 Wn.2d 667, 676, 257 P.3d 551 (2011). “The prosecutor owes a duty to defendants to see that their rights to a constitutionally fair trial are not violated.” Monday, 171 Wn.2d at 676. (Citing State v. Case, 49 Wn.2d 66, 71, 298 P.2d 500 (1956)). Given this responsibility, it would appear prosecutors have a duty to call to the court’s attention facts that suggest appointed counsel is not authorized to practice law in Washington. Unlike indigent defendants, such as Mr. Ayerst, prosecutors are presumed to understand the requirements set forth in the APRs. The prosecutor drafted and submitted to the court many documents in which the signature block lists only Mr. Van Idour as counsel and does not include a bar number for Mr. Van Idour. CP 1-134. In fact, every single pleading with Mr. Van Idour’s signature block fails to contain a bar number. CP ad Passim. Appendix—Petition for Review—13 It appears from this record that the prosecutor inexplicably remained silent despite the red flags concerning Mr. Van Idour’s unauthorized representation. Mr. Ayerst was denied his constitution right to counsel as guaranteed under both state and federal constitutions. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. For this reason, this Court should grant review and remand for a new trial. 2. MR.AYERST WAS DENIED HIS DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL, FREE FROM THE RISK OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL BIAS.The Court of Appeals erred by concluding when considering the risk of unconstitutional bias, that there was no nexus between Mr. Gallina’s conduct and Mr. Ayerst’s case that could create an unconstitutional risk of bias. (Slip Opinion at 9-10). And further erred by applying the wrong standard - insisting Mr. Ayerst show Gallina’s “actual bias”, rather than the risk of bias. (Slip Opinion at 10-11). Mr. Ayerst’s case implicates the due process clause under the state and federal constitution because “[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.” In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955); accord State ex rel. McFerran v. Justice Court of Evangeline Starr, 32 Wn.2d 544, 549-50, 202 P.2d 927 (1949). Due process also requires the absence of Appendix—Petition for Review—14 an unconstitutional “risk of bias.” Rippo v. Baker, ––– U.S. ––––, 137 S.Ct. 905, 907, 197 L.Ed. 2d 167 (2017). By objective standards this does not require proof of actual bias, just the risk of such bias. Williams v. Pennsylvania, ––– U.S. ––––, 136 S.Ct. 1899, 1905, 195 L.Ed. 2d 132 (2016); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 825, 106 S.Ct. 1580, 89 L.Ed. 2d 823 (1986). The Court of Appeals citied this language and ignored it. (Slip Opinion at 10-11). The unconstitutional risk of bias analysis also starts with a presumption of judicial integrity. Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47-48, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 43 L.Ed. 2d 712 (1975). This is overcome when considering the “psychological tendencies and human weakness” involved. Williams, 136 U.S. at 1906; Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47. a. Wrongful Standard Applied and Presumption of Judicial Integrity Destroyed. In Rippo v. Baker, ___U.S.___, 137 S.Ct 905, 197 L.Ed. 2d 167 (2017), the United States Supreme Court reversed the Nevada State Supreme Court for applying the wrong standard- requiring actual bias rather than the risk of bias, in the same manner the Court of Appeals applied the wrong standard in Mr. Ayerst’s case. Rippo, 137 S.Ct. at 907 (judge under investigation for fraud). Appendix—Petition for Review—15 Not only did the court required Mr. Ayerst prove actual bias, rather than the risk of bias, Gallina, by virtue of the allegations against him, which resulted in his arrest and removal from the bench, and his facilitating Mr. Van Idour’s illegal practice of law, overcomes the presumption of judicial integrity. For these reasons, under Rippo, Mr. Ayerst was denied his right to a trial free from the risk of unconstitutional bias. Rippo, 137 S.Ct. at 907. This Court should grant review on this basis. 3. MR.AYERST WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO THE APPEARANCE OF FAIRNESS.The Court of Appeals erred by concluding when considering the appearance of fairness, that there was no nexus between Mr. Gallina’s conduct and Mr. Ayerst’s case that implicated the appearance of fairness. (Slip Opinion at 9-10). And further erred by apply the wrong standard - insisting Mr. Ayerst show Gallina’s “actual bias”, rather than the appearance of bias. (Slip Opinion at 10-11). The appearance of fairness doctrine provides greater protection. It permits litigants to make fair trial claims based on violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct (Code), regardless of whether those claims implicate due process. Tatham v. Rogers, 170 Wn.App. 76, 102, 283 P.3d 583 (2012). Appendix—Petition for Review—16 In addition to abiding by the CJC, judges must also adhere to the appearance of fairness doctrine. Swenson, 158 Wn. App. at 818 (citing State v. Dominguez, 81 Wn. App. 325, 328, 914 P.2d 141 (1996)). This doctrine requires in relevant part that a judge disqualify himself from a proceeding if the judge’s impartiality could reasonably be questioned. Swenson, 158 Wn. App. at 818 (citing CJC 2.11(A)). Washington courts have consistently held that the appearance of fairness in judicial proceedings is especially important in the context of criminal proceedings. State v. Chambers, 176 Wn.2d 573, 293 P.3d 1185 (2013); State v. Finch, 181 Wn. App. 387, 326 P.3d 148 (2014). Cases involving violation of the CJC’s and the appearance of fairness in non-criminal cases have held behavior far less egregious than in Ayerst’s case to violate the appearance of fairness. In the Matter of the Disciplinary Proceedings Against Ralph G.Turco, Tacoma Municipal Court Judge, 137 Wn.2d 227, 239, 970 P.2d 731 (1999); Dependency of A.E.T.H., 9 Wn. App.2d 502, 517-18, 446 P.3d 667 (2019). Judges commit to higher standards of conduct at all hours of every day - more so than the “ordinary” person. Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 239. “Judges should respect and comply with the Appendix—Petition for Review—17 law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 239; (CJC). In Turco, the Supreme Court discussed the “nexus between the judge’s extrajudicial conduct shoving his wife, and the judge's duties.” Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 244. This Court saw a clear nexus between a judge's extrajudicial domestic violence and public confidence in the judiciary, especially the judge's ability to act impartially in domestic violence cases. Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 239. Turco argued that his extrajudicial conduct in shoving his wife had nothing to do with his official conduct as a judge and, therefore, should not subject him to censure. This Court disagreed, noting that it had previously held “Canons 1 and 2(A) also apply to actions by a judge in a nonjudicial context.” Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 239. Here too as in Turco, Gallina violated the law and the CJC’s by being charged with acts of sexual violence, regardless of whether he is convicted, in addition to participating in misleading this Court by facilitating Mr. Van Idour’s illegal practice of law. Just as this Court identified a clear nexus in Turco’s case, here, the nexus is deeper and broader, involving far more egregious conduct in manner and scope than the acts in Turco, involving a shove. Appendix—Petition for Review—18 Gallina’s alleged criminal conduct, establishes, even without a conviction, a nexus between his extra judicial conduct and his role as a judge in all indigent criminal cases by violating the CJC’s. Turco, 137 Wn.2d at 239; Tatham, 170 Wn.App. at 102. The allegations of dishonesty, sexual assault or assault, and the conduct involving Mr. Van Idour’s illegal practice of law, more so than the allegation that Turco’s shoved his wife, violates the appearance of fairness because an objective observer would doubt Gallina’s ability to preside impartially over any cases involving sexual assault, assault, and dishonesty. This basic disregard for the CJC’s violates the appearance of fairness. Tatham, 170 Wn.App. at 102. a. Relationship to Bias. Circumstances and relationships must also be considered in determining whether the appearance of fairness is violated. In re Dependency of A.E.T.H., 9 Wn. App.2d 502, 517-18, 446 P.3d 667 (2019). A.E.T.H., is a recent case discussing the judge’s relationship to the Superior by virtue of his role as a judge, who displayed no personal bias and who conducted an unbiased proceeding, but the evidence of potential bias came from judge’s employment within the superior court and general association with other apparently biased Appendix—Petition for Review—19 superior court employees. The Court of Appeals held by virtue of his relationship with the court, despite an exemplary record of presiding over the case, the appearance of fairness was violated. A.E.T.H., 9 Wn. App. 2d at 517-21. Far more significant than in A.E.T.H., where the judge did nothing wrong other than to be associated with the court, here, Gallina by virtue of his relationship with Mr. Van Idour, actively assisted Mr. Van Idour to unlawfully practice law. With these facts, Gallina’s judicial integrity is destroyed, and impartiality could reasonably be questioned. Swenson, 158 Wn. App. at 818 (citing CJC 2.11(A)). For these reasons, this Court should grant the petition and remand for a new trial before a different.

These protections are undermined when trial counsel or the judge is engaged in criminal activity. A defendant seeking to overturn a conviction based on criminal activity by counsel or a judge bears the burden of proving the activity occurred in a way that undermines confidence in the fairness of the criminal proceedings. Generalized allegations of unproven misconduct do not meet this standard. Robert Ayerst challenges the constitutionality of his felony convictions based on alleged illegal activities by his trial counsel and judge. However, he fails to support the allegations with sufficient proof. Based on this lack of proof, we deny his petition for relief from personal restraint. No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst FACTS In 2016 and 2017, Robert Ayerst faced several felony charges in Asotin County, Washington. He received appointed counsel by the name of Robert Van Idour. Mr. Van Idour has been licensed to practice law in Idaho for approximately 30 years. He provided public defense for Asotin County under contract and was working under the supervision of a Washington attorney named Neil Cox. A jury issued guilty verdicts against Mr. Ayerst after Mr. Van Idour represented him at trial. Mr. Ayerst’s judgment and sentence was entered on December 18, 2017. Over a year later, in April 2019, several events occurred that are relevant to the current case. On April 10, the State filed criminal charges against Mr. Ayerst’s trial judge, Scott Gallina. Judge Gallina was alleged to have committed second degree rape, indecent liberties (by forcible compulsion), and assault in the third degree with sexual motivation. On April 11, this court issued an unpublished opinion affirming Mr. Ayerst’s judgment and sentence. On April 19, the Washington State Bar Association (WSBA) filed a formal complaint regarding Mr. Van Idour with the disciplinary board of the 2 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst Washington Supreme Court, alleging he did not have authorization to practice law in Washington as an out-of-state attorney. The complaints against Judge Gallina and Mr. Van Idour have yet to be adjudicated. At the time this case was submitted for argument, Mr. Van Idour remained licensed to practice law in Idaho. On August 8, 2019, Mr. Ayerst filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) with this court. He alleges several defects at his trial, including deprivation of his rights to counsel and an impartial trial judge, based on the pending allegations against Mr. Van Idour and Judge Gallina. Mr. Ayerst was appointed counsel to assist him with the PRP and the matter was submitted to a panel of this court for disposition. ANALYSIS Deprivation of counsel Mr. Ayerst contends that because Mr. Van Idour was not authorized to practice law in Washington at the time of his trial, his judgment is void and he is automatically entitled to relief from conviction based on a theory of structural error. The State disagrees that structural error applies. According to the State, Mr. Ayerst must show he was prejudiced 3 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst by Mr. Van Idour’s alleged wrongdoing and, because he has not done so, he is not entitled to relief. A litigant challenging a criminal conviction through a PRP typically must show prejudice; i.e, that the error impacted the outcome of the case. In re Pers. Restraint of Finstad, 177 Wn.2d 501, 506, 301 P.3d 450 (2013). An exception can apply in the context of structural error. A structural error is one impacting the framework of the trial process. Weaver v. Massachusetts, __ U.S. __, 137 S.Ct. 1899, 1907, 198 L.Ed. 2d 420 (2017). Structural errors are generally considered per se prejudicial and will require reversal of a conviction regardless of specific prejudice.1 Denial of the right to counsel is an error that can be considered structural. When counsel is denied completely—such as when a defendant is forced into self-representation—the trial process is undermined and fundamental fairness requires reversal of the conviction regardless of prejudice or the strength of the State’s case. See id.; United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed. 2d 657 (1984). But lesser right to counsel violations do not require such a strong remedy. The trial 1 In some contexts, structural error will apply differently on direct and collateral review. See In re Pers. Restraint of Coggin, 182 Wn.2d 113, 120, 123, 340 P.3d P.3d 810 (2010) (C.Johnson, J., lead opinion with Madsen, C.J., concurring) (public trial violation). But our cases have not made this distinction in the right to counsel context. In re Pers. Restraint of Crace, 174 Wn.2d 835, 846-47, 280 P.3d 1102 (2012). 4 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst process is not jeopardized when a defendant merely receives deficient legal representation. To overturn a conviction when the right to counsel is impinged, but not denied altogether, the defendant must show counsel’s deficiencies prejudiced the outcome of the proceedings. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed. 2d 674 (1984); In re Pers. Restraint of Crace, 174 Wn.2d 835, 280 P.3d 1102 (2012). Mr. Ayerst’s case falls between the two well-established scenarios of how to treat deprivation of counsel claims. Mr. Ayerst was not forced to represent himself at trial; he had the benefit of an attorney with considerable legal experience. But at the same time, because Mr. Ayerst’s attorney was not licensed in Washington, he did not have “counsel” as that term is defined for constitutional purposes. See City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 217, 687 P.2d 630 (1983). The seminal case addressing how to treat a claim for relief based on representation by an unlicensed person is Judge Henry Friendly’s opinion in Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 1983). Mr. Solina was convicted of federal bank robbery charges. After trial, he discovered the individual who had been representing him was not a licensed attorney. The individual was posing as an attorney after he graduated law school, but failed the bar exam. Mr. Solina filed a petition for collateral relief from conviction, alleging he had been denied the right to counsel. 5 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted Mr. Solina’s request for relief even though he had not shown the lack of a licensed attorney prejudiced the result in his case. The federal court reasoned the concept of prejudice was inapplicable because Mr. Solina’s case involved an inherent conflict of interest. An individual fraudulently posing as a lawyer is involved in criminal activity. As such, the individual operates under “fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should lead the prosecutor or the trial judge” to make an inquiry into credentials. Id. A conviction cannot be upheld in such circumstances; a defendant in a criminal trial “is entitled to be represented by someone free from such constraints.” Id. In the decades since Solina, courts have generally agreed structural error applies to representation by an unlicensed attorney only if the attorney has never been licensed in any jurisdiction. Bear v. United States, 777 F.3d 1008, 1011 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Bergman, 599 F.3d 1142, 1147-48 (10th Cir. 2010); United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1132 (D.C.Cir. 2000); United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 916 (5th Cir. 1998); Vance v. Lehman, 64 F.3d 119, 121-22 (3d Cir. 1995); Bond v. United States, 1 F.3d 631, 636-37 (7th Cir. 1993); State v. Edison, 61 Wn. App. 530, 537, 811 P.2d 958 (1991); United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682, 696 (9th Cir. 1986). 6 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst The limited allowance for structural error is based on two considerations. “First, courts are concerned that a defendant have a counselor who has legal training and demonstrated the specialized knowledge and ability of a lawyer.” Maria-Martinez, 143 F. 3d at 916. This concern was emphasized in the Washington Supreme Court’s decision in Ratliff, where the defendant was represented by a law student who operated outside the parameters of the admission to practice rules applicable to law students. 100 Wn.2d at 217. Second, there is concern “an undisclosed lack of credentials may create a conflict of interest.” Mariz-Martinez, 143 F. 3d at 916. This consideration is based on Judge Friendly’s analysis in Solina. Mr. Ayerst argues that even though Mr. Van Idour has an out-of-state license, his circumstances are akin to the conflict of interest scenario discussed in Solina. According to Mr. Ayerst, Mr. Van Idour’s unlicensed representation amounted to criminal behavior, thus prohibiting him from providing unrestrained, vigorous representation. Just as Mr. Solina was entitled to relief from conviction without showing prejudice, Mr. Ayerst claims he too should have his convictions overturned. We disagree Mr. Ayerst’s circumstances are like those in Solina. Unlike the charlatan in Solina, Mr. Van Idour was and is an attorney, subject to state licensing regulations. Under at least some circumstances, Mr. Van Idour could have been qualified 7 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst to provide indigent defense representation in Washington. See APR 8. The WSBA allegations against Mr. Van Idour have not been proven. And even under the facts alleged, it is not clear Mr. Van Idour was purposefully evading Washington’s licensing requirements at the time he represented Mr. Ayerst. Mr. Van Idour could have been confused. Had that been the case, he would not have been operating under the kind of conflict of interest identified in Solina. Individuals filing for PRP relief bear the burden of proving facts justifying their claims. In re Pers. Restraint of Hews, 99 Wn.2d 80, 88, 660 P.2d 263 (1983). “Bald assertions and conclusory allegations” are insufficient. In re Pers. Restraint of Rice, 118 Wn.2d 876, 886, 828 P.2d 1086 (1992). If the existing record is insufficient to justify relief, a reference hearing may be ordered under RAP 16.11(a) and RAP 16.12. Hews, 99 Wn.2d at 88. But to obtain a reference hearing, the petitioner must demonstrate they have “competent, admissible evidence to establish the facts that entitle [them] to relief.” Rice, 118 Wn.2d at 886. This burden is similar to that required in the civil summary judgment context. See id. Mr. Ayerst has not alleged facts suggesting Mr. Van Idour’s licensing problems were sufficiently severe to fall in line with Judge Friendly’s analysis in Solina. He has not 8 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst requested a reference hearing and we do not deem one applicable. Mr. Ayerst therefore has not established a basis for PRP relief. Partiality of trial judge Apart from his claims regarding Mr. Van Idour, Mr. Ayerst argues he was denied his due process right to a fair trial based on the criminal allegations against Judge Gallina. Although the State did not file charges against Judge Gallina until after Mr. Ayerst’s trial and sentencing, Mr. Ayerst claims Judge Gallina’s participation in his case denied him the right to an impartial tribunal under the appearance of fairness doctrine. We recently addressed claims similar to those raised by Mr. Ayerst. State v. Williams, No. 37075-5-III, slip op. at 2 (Wash. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/370755_unp.pdf. Two members of the current panel were on the panel in Williams. The attorney representing Mr. Williams in this court is the same as the one currently representing Mr. Ayerst. The briefing submitted in Williams largely mirrors Mr. Ayerst’s briefing. In Williams, we held the mere existence of criminal charges against Judge Gallina does not establish a basis for relief from conviction. Although the allegations against Judge Gallina if proven would constitute violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and could raise issues under the appearance of fairness doctrine, the judge’s alleged 9 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst misconduct would not provide grounds for relief from conviction unless tied to specific circumstances of the defendant’s case. After Williams was issued, Mr. Ayerst filed a statement of additional authorities identifying the following cases as support for his arguments regarding due process and the appearance of fairness doctrine: Rippo v. Baker, __U.S.__, 137 S.Ct. 905, 197 L.Ed. 2d 167 (2017); In re Dependency of A.N.G., 12 Wn. App. 2d 789, 459 P.3d 1099 (2020); Williams v. Pennsylvania, __ U.S.__, 136 S.Ct. 1899, 1905, 195 L.Ed. 2d 132 (2016); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Levoie, 475 U.S. 813, 825, 106 S.Ct. 1580, 89 L.Ed. 2d 823 (1986). The supplemental cases submitted by Mr. Ayerst stand for the rule that due process can require a trial judge’s recusal even when the judge has not manifested any “actual bias.” Aetna Life Ins. Co., 475 U.S. at 825. The cases recognize actual bias can be difficult to prove. The standard for recusal is therefore objective and asks whether, under the circumstances of a particular case, there is “an unconstitutional potential for bias.” Williams, 136 S.Ct. at 1905. The test for an unconstitutional risk of bias by a judicial officer is similar to the one identified in Solina regarding deprivation of the right to counsel; the issue boils down to whether the judge is laboring under a conflict of interest. In Williams and A.N.G, the 10 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst conflict was that the judge had previously been involved in bringing a case against the accused. Williams, 136 S.Ct. at 1905-06 (prior criminal prosecution); A.N.G., 12 Wn. App. 2d at 794 (prior dependency petition). In Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Lavoie, the conflict was that an Alabama Supreme Court justice who was the deciding vote in a decision favorable to the Lavoies was himself in the process of suing an insurance company under a novel theory analogous to the Lavoies’ case. And in Rippo, the conflict was that the trial judge was being targeted for criminal investigation by the same authorities who were prosecuting the defendant. 137 S.Ct. at 906. As was true in Williams, Mr. Ayerst does not point to any particular rulings or statements of Judge Gallina suggesting actual bias. Instead, Mr. Ayerst claims his case is similar to Rippo, because Judge Gallina was being investigated by the same authorities bringing charges against Mr. Ayerst. According to Mr. Ayerst, this created an unconstitutional risk of bias regardless of whether Judge Gallina was actually biased. Similar to his claims regarding Mr. Van Idour, Mr. Ayerst’s arguments regarding Judge Gallina fail for want of factual support. Nothing in the record suggests Judge Gallina was aware of the State’s investigation of him during the pendency of Mr. Ayerst’s case. As a result, there is no reason to believe Judge Gallina was laboring under a conflict between his duties as a jurist and a desire to avoid criminal prosecution. Mr. Ayerst 11 No. 36965-0-III In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst argues Judge Gallina must have been conflicted because he knew he was engaged in unlawful criminal activity and therefore would have wanted to issue rulings deflecting attention away from himself. This argument assumes both that Judge Gallina is guilty of the pending criminal charges and that he was concerned about getting caught. The current record does not support these assumptions.2 Mr. Ayerst has failed to meet his burden to establish facts warranting relief from conviction based on the allegations against Judge Gallina. Mr. Ayerst has not established unlawful restraint. His petition for relief is dismissed. The panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, and that the remainder having no precedential value shall be filed for public record pursuant to RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered. 2 At oral argument, counsel for Mr. Ayerst claimed a nunc pro tunc order issued by Judge Gallina indicated the court was colluding with Mr. Van Idour in his criminal effort to practice law without a Washington license. This factual claim is nothing more than speculation. Moreover, it has not been properly raised. The claims against Judge Gallina contained in Mr. Ayerst’s petition and briefing are limited to the Asotin County criminal charges. 12 No. 36965-0-111 In re Pers. Restraint of Ayerst Remaining claims Mr. Ayerst makes four additional claims of error: (1) insufficiency of evidence, (2) improper contact between the prosecutor and jurors, (3) failure to admit a recorded video, and ( 4) violation of the speedy trial rule. The first claim fails because it was addressed on direct review and Mr. Ayerst does not show why the interests of justice require reassessment. See In re Pers. Restraint of Brown, 143 Wn.2d 431, 445, 21 P.3d 687 (2001 ). The second and third claims fail for lack of factual support. See Cook, 114 Wn.2d at 813-14. The last claim fails because it involves a nonconstitutional error and Mr. Ayerst does not demonstrate "a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice." Id. at 812. CONCLUSION Mr. Ayerst has not established unlawful restraint. His petition for relief is dismissed.
