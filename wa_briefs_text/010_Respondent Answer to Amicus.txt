II.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The State relies on the facts provided in its previous briefs. III.ARGUMENT A.Procedural reasons to reject Amici's proposal. There are two procedural reasons the Court should reject amici's proposal. The first is that Mr. Zamora did not request this relief, and the Court does not normally consider arguments raised for the first time on review by amici. Keodalah v. Allstate Ins. Co., 194 Wn.2d 339, 346 n. 4,449 P.3d 1040, 1045 (2019). The second is that what amici proposes is a major restructuring of the criminal justice system, as discussed below. GR 3 7 was passed as a court rule, which allows notice and -1-comment from all interested parties. Amici proposes to drastically expand an already questionable rule that will affect a large percentage of cases in the criminal justice system. Such expansion of a rule is more properly done through notice and comment rule making, where anyone can present input to the court, rather than through a case, where opportunities for outside participation and introduction of facts are much more limited. For both of these reasons amici's argument should be rejected out of hand. B.Amici's proposal to create "separate but equal" justice systems based on race fail any sort of rational basis test, much less the strict scrutiny the proposal would be subject to. 1. GR 37 already creates a class of "super jurors" both privileged and burdened beyond other jurors. "It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race." League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 511, 126 S.Ct. 2594, 2663, 165 L.Ed. 2d 609 (2006)(Roberts, C.J. concurring in part and dissenting in part). -2-In State v. Listoe, 15 Wn. App. 2d 308, 322, 475 P.3d 534, 541 (2020), the State struck a juror because he "expressed discomfort at the idea of convicting an individual for violating a 'ridiculous sounding law,"' Id. at 323. The question was intended to inquire into juror's willingness to follow the court's instructions. Other jurors did not have such discomfort at the same hypothetical. The appellate court ruled that because race "could have been a factor" in excusing the juror, the case must be reversed. Notably the court stated "In so holding, we do not mean to suggest that the State, in exercising the challenge, acted with a discriminatory purpose or that the State acted with unconscious or implicit bias." Id. In State v. Omar, 12 Wn. App. 2d 747, 753, 460 P.3d 225, 228, review denied, 196 Wn.2d 1016, 475 P.3d 164 (2020), a robbery case, the defense moved to exclude an Asian juror who had previously been the victim of a robbery. The defense did not move to exclude another Asian juror. Defense counsel was not articulate in his response to the GR 37 -3-challenge, and the denial of the preemptory was upheld on appeal. Wrightv. 3M Co., 81289-1-I, 2021 WL 5879009, at *9 (Wash. Ct. App. Dec. 13, 202l)(unpublished), is a mesothelioma case. An African American juror, one of four on the panel, indicated that she had four family members with cancer. The court denied a challenge because an objective observer could view the challenge as based on race. The Court held "Of key importance is the low threshold established by GR 3 7 that an objective observer could view race or ethnicity as a factor." Id., (emphasis in original). As these cases and others demonstrate, minority jurors are not being removed, despite the fact that no one would even blink at removing majority jurors for the exact same reasons. This provides a special privilege to minority jurors against removal from jury panels. It also imposes a heavier burden on them. One common practice is for parties to use preemptory challenges to remove jurors who do not want to be there. They -4-may have a hardship that the court found insufficient, or they may simply not want to be there. No counsel would ever engage in this practice for minority jurors in light of GR 37. While GR 37 does not facially apply to for cause and hardship challenges, attorneys and judges will also be more hesitant to strike minority jurors based on the principles espoused in the rule. Therefore the burden of jury duty falls harder on minority jurors. If jurors were employees, GR 37 would be prohibited under Title VII. "Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed." McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L.Ed. 2d 668 (1973). There is no doubt that removing racial bias from the justice system is a compelling State interest. Whether GR 37 is sufficiently narrowly tailored to survive the requisite strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has not yet been finally resolved. (See U.S.CONST. amend. XIV.) -5-2. Expanding GR 37 to create "super witnesses" and "super defendants" will cause significantly more harm than good and greatly reduce confidence in the justice system. For an example of the harm this would cause one need look no further than the record in this case, and the appellant's court of appeals brief. A witness to the fight, Javier Torres, was called by the defense. On cross examination he discussed why he never told his story to the police. His answer was "Oh, if it's a cop, I don't have nothing to do and nothing to say." RP 834. In closing argument the prosecutor pointed out Mr. Torres' bias. RP 903. In his appeal Mr. Zamora raised this issue, accusing the prosecutor of committing "the sin of Monday." Brief of Appellant at 54-55. He compared the prosecutor's argument that Mr. Torres was not credible based on his testimony to a statement that argued "black folk don't testify against black folk." Id., citing State v. Monday, 171 Wn.2d 667,674,257 P.3d 511 (2011). The Court of Appeals correctly held that the prosecutor's argument regarding Mr. -6-Torres' credibility was based on Mr. Torres' testimony, not his race. State v. Zamora, 17 Wn. App. 2d 1073, review granted in part, 198 Wn.2d 1017, 497 P.3d 376 (2021)(unpublished). The State is unsure whether a court would find an objective person could consider that this argument could be based on race. Apparently appellate counsel felt it was. The Court of Appeals, applying a normal standard of proof, held it was not. As demonstrated by the case law surrounding GR 37, what a reasonably objective person could consider being based on race is in the eye of the judicial beholder. Regardless of whether a court would eventually uphold this argument or not under amici's rule, an expansion of GR 37 to this area would be a significant deterrent to cross examination and fair attack on a witness' credibility, as a cold review by an appellate court would result in a reversal, despite completely valid reasons for the questions and argument. Amici's policy would tum witnesses like Mr. Torres into "super witnesses", immune from attacks on their credibility, because of their race. Regardless of -7-the pros and cons of GR 37, its effect on the fact determination function that is the primary purpose of a trial is fairly indeterminate, as the identity of the jurors has a very imprecise effect on a trial. Amici's rule would directly affect the facts placed before a jury based on the race of the witness or defendant. Such a rule is indefensible. Such a rule would also cripple a fair voir dire. There are two major themes that were relevant to this case, and repeated over and over again in our politics and society. One is the downtrodden simply trying to make their way in the world being stepped on by the man. Another is the Thin Blue Line protecting society. These themes manifest themselves in many social issues, including immigration and Black Lives matter. As Mr. Zamora noted in his supplemental brief anyone watching the news between 2016 and 2019 understood these themes. Supp. Brief of Petitioner at 21. Defense counsel's strategy was clearly to play to the first theme. How jurors react to these themes is critical information for voir dire. Attorneys -8-are not permitted to refer to the facts of a case. Therefore they often bring up analogies. For better or for worse these themes have been tied politically and socially to race. Here amici says that the prosecutor could have explored the "attitudes about locked doors and neighborhood safety." Brief of Amici at 5. What Amici does not do is explain how this could be done so no one could associate any such discussion with race. As demonstrated by the challenge to the credibility of the defense witness in this case, just about anything in the criminal justice system could be associated with race, even if there is a perfectly reasonable alternative explanation. If someone wants to look for a racial reason, they can probably find it. 3. Extending GR 37 to all actions by a prosecutor would not be narrowly tailored, would destroy a fair criminal justice system, and would hurt minorities most of all. GR 37 essentially places a beyond a reasonable doubt burden on a party to prove that a peremptory challenge is not -9-based, in part, on race. 1 But just because something could conceivably be based on race does not mean that it was. GR 3 7 flips the normal presumption on its head. Generally the party accusing the other of wrongdoing faces the burden of proof, with the accused not having to prove the negative of having no ill intent. GR 3 7 is essentially guilty of race-based conduct until proven innocent beyond a reasonable doubt. As a practical matter this means that minority jurors are almost immune from preemptory challenges. To extend this immunity to witnesses and defendants would mean that groups would have special privileges from prosecution based on race. As discussed previously, the appellate attorney in this case believed legitimate impeachment and argument from testimony could be viewed as having race or ethnicity as a 1 A reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a reason exists. WPIC 4.01. If the Court determines that an objective observer could view race or ethnicity as a factor ... the preemptory challenge shall be denied. GR 37. To rephrase GR 37, if there is a reasonable reason to believe race or ethnicity is a factor, the preemptory challenge shall be denied. -10-factor in that impeachment. There are many other areas where there are legitimate reasons to do something, but that could be viewed as being based on race. By now it is dogma that African Americans are incarcerated in disproportionate numbers compared to their percentage of the population. However, when one looks at victims there are also disproportionate numbers. Take, for example, the FBI expanded homicide data table 6 for 2019, tabulating the race of both offenders and victims in murder cases in 2019. 2 The table shows that there were 3,299 White murder victims, and 2,906 African American murder victims. The large majority of murder victims were killed by someone of the same race. Presumably amici 's rule would extend to charging decisions, as well as every other decision made by the prosecutor. 2 https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/20 l 9/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls (Last visited 02 Feb 2022). -11-How would someone prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, a charging decision was not based on race (or ethnicity), given these facts? One of the most important factors in charging a case is provability. RCW 9.94A.411(2). Yet under amici's proposed rule the provability of a case could depend on the race of a defendant and/or witnesses. As this case demonstrates, a legitimate attack on witness credibility could be perceived as being based, in part, on racial bias, even if, in reality, it was not. Charging decisions have been considered mostly unreviewable. State v. Korum, 157 Wn.2d 614, 625, 141 P.3d 13, 20 (2006). Yet under amici rules any charging decision would be subject to a claim of racial bias. Given that every case is different, with no two cases exactly comparable, the only way to defend against such a claim would be to substantially undercharge minority defendants, if they can be charged at all given the restrictions on dealing with witnesses such a rule would engender. -12-Of course such a rule would be beneficial to minority defendants. But given that most victims are of the same race of the perpetrator, this rule would be extremely harmful to minority victims. How does one explain to a scared victim that their perpetrator will be released because he or she is a minority, where a non-minority defendant would be charged and prosecuted based on the same facts. This would be the result of amici' s rule. 4. Expanding GR 37 expands the harm it causes in a predicable way. Evidentiary burdens, such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or whether an action could be based on race or ethnicity, are a way of allocating the risk of error. The justice system considers the wrongful convictions more harmful than wrongful acquittals, so the system has a high burden of proof to convict someone. This results in many false acquittals. False acquittals cause harm. Sometimes someone who is wrongly acquitted goes on to cause significant damage, such as murder. Our -13-system is willing to accept those harms to avoid the harm of false convictions. GR 3 7 is similar. It allows many jurors who would otherwise be excluded from a jury for legitimate reasons to be placed on a jury to avoid the potential harm of an improper exclusion based on race or ethnicity. Given the difficulty of determining the effect of a juror either placed or not placed on a jury it is impossible to determine the level of harm GR 37 causes to avoid the harm it is aimed at. Whether our system should accept this harm is another question. Expanding GR 3 7 to cover everything a prosecutor does would greatly multiply the harm it would cause. It would essentially create two justice systems, one for minority defendants and one for everyone else. Legitimate tactics and arguments would be forbidden because they could be perceived as being based on race or ethnicity, even though there would be significant non-racial justifications. -14-5. Separate but equal failed 126 years ago; it would fail now. In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 548, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1142, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), the Supreme Court held that separate but equal was acceptable and a legitimate state of affairs. In Brown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, Shawnee Cty., Kan., 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 692, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), supplemented sub nom. Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Kan., 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 71 Ohio Law Abs. 584, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955), the Supreme Court held that separate was inherently unequal. GR 37 is already providing rules that separate minority jurors from majority jurors. Expanding GR 37 would produce a different set of rules for minority defendants as opposed to majority defendants. Trying to make things equal by making them unequal repeats and magnifies the errors of Plessy. While minority criminal defendants may come out ahead, minority victims would be the -15-big losers under amici's rule, as would faith in the fairness of the justice system. 6. Expanding GR 37 would not be narrowly tailored. "The principle of equal protection admits no artificial line of a 'two-class theory' that permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that accorded others." Fisher v. Univ. of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297,307, 133 S.Ct. 2411, 2417, 186 L.Ed. 2d 474 (2013), citing Regents a/Univ. a/Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265,305, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed. 2d 750 (1978). "We have held that all racial classifications imposed by government "must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. This means that such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests." Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306,326, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 2337-38, 156 L.Ed. 2d 304 (2003). -16-As demonstrated by the cases applying it, GR 3 7 is an over inclusive blunderbuss. While it tries to prevent racially discriminatory reasons for removing jurors, it also prevents valid reasons for removing jurors. There may be multiple good reasons for dismissal of a juror, but if the dismissal could be based on race, that trumps all of the legitimate reasons. Likewise, any argument that a decision could be based on race would trump all legitimate arguments. It is very easy to play the race card. Under a proper standard of proof it is generally easy to rebut it as well. But how is that done when the problem is a disparate impact and the requirement is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? Each side can point to statistics to support its position. The only way to meet this burden would be to charge and prosecute minorities substantially less than non minorities are prosecuted for the same crimes, just as GR 3 7 requires that minorities are not dismissed on the same basis as majority jurors. Whatever this is, it is not equal protection under the law, and minority crime victims will pay the greatest -17-pnce. The only thing that is narrowly tailored about GR 37 is the fact that it is limited to voir dire. Expanding the rule would destroy this narrow tailoring. All can agree that eliminating wrongful convictions is an important goal of the criminal justice system. It is actually fairly easy to do. The most sure way to prevent wrongful convictions is to eliminate convictions. But the cost to society for that solution would simply be too high. Likewise eliminating racial bias against minorities in the justice system is an important goal. But it cannot be accomplished at the expense of the fundamental purpose of the system, determining the truth and holding offenders accountable for their actions. Amici's rule would crush the truth finding function in a quest to avoid anything that could be considered based on racial or ethnic bias. For example, criminal street gangs are often times associated with race. Gang evidence is also strong evidence of motive in certain cases. E.g. State v. Embry, 171 Wn. App. 714, 733, 287 P.3d 648, 659 (2012). Would amici's rule forbid -18-gang evidence because it could be based on race, even though there is significant evidence it was for a legitimate purpose? What if the gang member was not a minority? Would the evidence be admissible in his trial, but not in a fellow gang member's trial who was a minority? 7. The proper standard of proof is preponderance of evidence. Defendants are among the people that a prosecutor represents, and a prosecutor who intentionally seeks to secure a conviction by resorting to racist arguments violates the constitutional promise of an impartial jury trial. State v. Monday, 171 Wn.2d 667, 676,680,257 P.3d 551 (2011). "[R]esorting to racist arguments is so fundamentally opposed to our founding principles, values, and fabric of our justice system" that it does not need to be explained. Id. "[A]ppeals to racial prejudices cannot be minimized or easily rationalized as harmless." Id. Therefore, when a prosecutor intentionally -19-resorts to racist arguments the test is constitutional harmless error. Id. No one would argue that resorting to a racist argument is appropriate. But this case presents the question of what is resorting to a racist argument. Amici argues that anything that could be perceived as resorting to a racist argument should be considered to be conclusively proven to have been a resort to a racist argument. But, for better or for worse, race is heavily correlated with other issues in society, even though it may not be a causative issue. See, e.g. Lamparello, Adam Disparity's Relationship to Discrimination, Appellate Advocacy Blog. (2022)3. Voir dire "shall be conducted for the purpose of discovering any basis for challenge for cause and for the purpose of gaining knowledge to enable an intelligent exercise https :/ /lawprofessors.typepad.com/appellate advocacy/2022/0 I /disparitys-relationship-to-discrimination.html (last visited February 1, 2022). -20-of peremptory challenges." State v. Davis, 141 Wn.2d 798, 825, 10 P.3d 977, 994 (2000), citing CrR 6.4(b). "The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race." Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,551 U.S. 701, 748, 127 S.Ct. 2738, 2768, 168 L.Ed. 2d 508 (2007). The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race. Schuette v. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration & Immigrant Rights & Fight for Equal. By Any Means Necessary (BAMN), 572 U.S. 291,381, 134 S.Ct. 1623, 1676, 188 L.Ed. 2d 613 (2014)(Sotoymayor, J.Dissenting). It is important to be able to raise racially touchy topics in voir dire. In Davis, 141 Wn.2d at 995, the appellant complained that the judge had not raised the issue of racial bias. Indeed, in Davis it was the prosecutor that raised the issue of racial bias. Id. at 837. The appellant there apparently thought that was insufficient discussion and the judge should have sua -21-sponte done more. The proper standard as to whether racial bias was improperly injected into a trial is a preponderance of evidence. This strikes the correct balance between allowing raising of sensitive topics that need to be discussed, as well as statements that may be intended as innocuous, but some would interpret has having racial connotations,4 with the need to root out racial bias. This is the usual standard for determining wrongdoing in a preliminary or evidentiary matter, for instance under ER 404(b) or in a suppression hearing under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.Constitution, and Washington Constitution Article 1, Section 7. Here the prosecutor brought up an issue that is correlated with race in many minds. Defense counsel did not object because it was relevant information. He wanted to see how jurors would react to the line of questions. Strong reactions 4 For example, the word "grandfathered" is often used to refer to vested rights, but some have raised the fact of older, more racial connotations. Would use of the word now be prohibited when referring to vested rights? -22-either way would be valuable information in determining which jurors to challenge, either for cause or using preemptory challenges. That is the whole purpose ofvoir dire. Defense counsel felt the questions helped him more than the State. He was not umeasonable in believing this, as reactions to the questions would be telling. The border wall issue was analogous to, but not directly related to, the facts of the case. This is a common means of conducting voir dire. Referring to the actual facts of the case is forbidden, so attorneys bring up analogues situations to see if jurors have any biases or preconceived notions. By a preponderance of evidence these statements were made to gain information to exercise challenges, not inject race into the case. This is also evidenced by the fact that the defense attorney, without objection from the prosecution, informed the jury that his client was a U.S. citizen and immigration was not an issue. Nor was the issue ever raised again after voir dire. -23-IV.CONCLUSION Amici's rule would require complete avoidance of anything that could touch on race to avoid saying something that 'could' be interpreted as trying to inject racial bias. This simply encompasses too much legitimate discussion and evidence. It would create a de jure two tiered criminal justice system that would be unfair to both minorities and non minorities alike.
