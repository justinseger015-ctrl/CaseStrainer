See Brouillet v. Cowles Pub. Co., 114 Wn.2d 788, 798, 791 P.2d 526, 532 (1990) (observing substantiated allegations of sexual misconduct are of public concern “because the public must decide what can be done about it” but noting there may not be legitimate public interest in names of students). However, as this Court is aware from other filings in this matter, the identities of the two officers having been found to have committed misconduct on January 6, 2021 have, indeed, been disclosed.1 So, too, has the entire substance of the underlying investigation conducted by the Office of Police Accountability 1 Judicial notice may be taken at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/06/seattle-police-fired-capitol-riot/ (last accessed October 19, 2021). -1- (“OPA”). The only issue remaining on this appeal is whether the Public Record Act (“PRA”) likely mandates disclosure of the identities of the four Seattle police officers (“Represented Officers”) who were cleared of any involvement in the insurrection in the OPA Closed Case Summary (“OPA Summary”). The NPAP brings nothing to the table concerning that core issue. Rather, and without so much as citing to the PRA or the case law interpreting the privacy rubric of RCW 42.56.050, the NPAP argues that disclosure of the identities of “insurrectionist officers” who run “roughshod over constitutional norms” serves the public interest. Lacking from its analysis is whether the public interest is served in any way by disclosure of the identities of officers caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated concerns over being an “insurrectionist officer.” Indeed, the NPAP’s strident characterization of these four Represented Officers, after having been cleared by OPA, as “insurrectionist officers” underscores the inevitable exposure to -2- “hatred and ridicule, in the community, without any evidence that such misconduct ever occurred,” that these Represented Officers will suffer as a result of disclosure of their identities. Bellevue John Does 1-11 v. Bellevue Sch. Dist. #405, 164 Wn.2d 199, 215, 189 P.3d 139, 148 (2008). The Represented Officer’s legitimate concerns over a public rush to judgment, without so much as considering the OPA’s written findings, are certainly borne out in the NPAP Amici Brief, where even the drafting attorneys either failed to read the OPA Summary (or deliberately disregard its conclusions) before maligning the Represented Officers as “insurrectionist officers” in a public filing. See Amici Br. at p. 2 (“At least six Seattle Police officers participated in an insurrection at the United States Capital on January 6th 2021); see also pp. 6-8 (repeated references to “insurrectionist officers”). Or in the case of the closely affiliated2 National Lawyers Guild, demonize them as “white supremacist–affiliated officers” having 2 See Amici Br. of NPAP at p. 1 (…“(NPAP) was founded in 1999 by members of the National Lawyers Guild”). -3- infiltrated law enforcement based solely on their presence at a lawful political rally. See Amici Br. of Nat. Lawyers Guild. Because the NPAP’s brief does not address the relevant issue, assumes that the Represented Officers are so called “insurrectionist officers” despite being cleared by OPA, and indeed, makes no tenable argument for the public disclosure of the identities of police officers acquitted of misconduct, the NPAP offers little, if anything, to the relevant discussion. II.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Represented Officers hereby reincorporate the facts contained in their Supplemental Brief filed on September 30, 2021, pp. 2-5. III.DISCLOSURE OF THE IDENTITIES OF THE FOUR REPRESENTED OFFICERS CLEARED OF ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE INSURRECTION IS NOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERN TO THE PUBLIC Although not explicitly stated in its Amici Brief, the NPAP appears to be arguing that disclosure of the identities of “insurrectionist police officers” is of legitimate concern to the -4- public within the meaning of RCW 42.56.050. And, with respect to the two Seattle Police Officers having actually criminally trespassed during the insurrection, this is true. However, the specific identities of the Represented Officers caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated concerns over their involvement are not of “legitimate concern” to the public. And the NPAP makes no argument to the contrary. The NPAP emphasizes the involvement of its membership in “litigat[ing] the thousands of egregious cases of law enforcement abuse.” See Amici Br. of NPAP at p. 1. Like its stated mission, its Brief demonstrates a concerted effort to “litigate a case of law enforcement abuse” here. The problem is the relevant and substantiated facts do not rise anywhere near the level of law enforcement abuse. Instead, these facts demonstrate nothing more than constitutionally protected lawful off duty political activities of the four Represented Officers. See 9/30/21 Represented Officers’ Supp Br. at p. 4. It is undisputed, after a comprehensive administrative investigation, these Represented -5- Officers were cleared of any involvement in the January 6th insurrection. And, despite obvious public concern over the violation of Constitutional rights by police officers, there is nothing here remotely indicating that such concerns are implicated by the actions of the four Represented Officers. Yet, the thrust of the NPAP’s Amici Brief, and the authorities cited therein, focus on substantiated allegations of on duty police officer misconduct directed toward arrestees and/or suspects, and public interest in disclosure of those circumstances. In calling for the release of the “associated details about misconduct” it outright ignores the most salient fact – the OPA Summary, which contains all those details, has already been released. The transparency which fosters both public trust and police accountability is well preserved by disclosure of the substance of the investigation including its methodology, resulting factual determinations, and the rationale substantiating the ultimate conclusions. -6- Disclosure of the identities of public servants, including police officers who are the subject of unsubstantiated allegations “serve[s] no interest other than gossip and sensation.” Id. at 221 (internal quotes omitted); Bainbridge Island Police Guild v. City of Puyallup, 172 Wn.2d 398, 415, 259 P.3d 190, 198 (2011) (observing “no reason to distinguish an allegation of sexual misconduct against a police officer from an allegation of sexual misconduct against a teacher”). “The identity of the accused ... is unnecessary, and plays little role in the public’s oversight of the investigation.” Bellevue John Does, 164 Wn.2d at 220, 189 P.3d at 150 (emphasis original). “The name is most relevant to public oversight if the misconduct occurred—if the misconduct didn’t occur, the only actual governmental action is the investigation.” Id. (citation omitted) (emphasis original). In short, the identities of police officers do not aid the public in overseeing the government’s response to unsubstantiated allegations. Nor do they facilitate the investigative process. -7- Because the NLPA makes no argument as to how the identities of public employees caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated allegation is of legitimate concern to the public, an analysis of its brief should end there. IV.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Represented Officers respectfully request that this Court reverse the trial court’s order denying their request for a preliminary injunction, and remand with instructions to the trial court to enjoin production of the Represented Officers names or identities.
