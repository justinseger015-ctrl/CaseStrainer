FILED SUPREME COURT STATE OF WASHINGTON 2/28/2022 8:00 AM BY ERIN L.LENNON CLERK NO. 99948-1IN THE SUPREME COURTOF THE STATE OF WASHINGTONIN RE THE MATTER OF RECALL CHARGES AGAINSTWASHINGTON STATE GOVERNOR JAY R.INSLEEAPPELANT’S NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTALAUTHORITYAPPELANT PROPONENT C DAVIS ET ALC Davis Pro Se2103 Harrison Ave NWPMB 2164Olympia WA 98502recallinslee@gmail.comAppellant Proponent C Davis respectfully submits the following supplemental statement of authority in support of its opening brief and reply brief on file with this court.It is a striking coincidence that the published opinion, in Gonzales v. Inslee, was written on February 23rd, 2022, one day after our reply brief was filed. In our reply brief, we replied to Governor Inslee’s response brief's claim that there was no evidence that landlords have been harmed by Governor Inslee's violation of separation of powers. The Horwath article cited in our reply brief was cited solely as an anecdotal example of a harmed landlord. Others examples were also given, they are plentiful, as we stated in the reply. We made no determination on the merits of the Gonzales case.Even if the appellate court made an opinion on the constitutionality, it does not change the fact that the Gonzales' ---were harmed. Though the appellate court made an opinion of the Gonzales case, it is by no means a final determination. Thatcase will likely precede to the Washington Supreme Court.Quoting, in Brown v. Owen, 165 Wn.2d 706, cited in the Notice of Supplemental Authority:“None of the proclamation provisions are directedto the courts, and the proclamations do not purport to prevent the courts from taking any actions.” Though the proclamation does not prevent courts from TAKING action, it does prevent the court from initiating action,which on its face is interference. This was pointed out in both our opening brief and our reply brief.Political questions are "'political and governmental, and embraced within the scope of the powers conferred upon Congress [Legislature], and not therefore within the reach ofjudicial power.'" State v. Manussier, 129 Wn.2d 652, 670-71,921 P.2d 473 (1996) (quoting Pac. States Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 151, 32 S.Ct. 224, 56 L.Ed. 377 (1912)). Where the judicial branch is involved, our primary concerns are that the judiciary not be drawn into tasks more appropriate to another branch and that its institutional integrity be protected. Carrick, 125 Wn.2d at 136 (citing Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 383, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed. 2d 714 (1989)). This is the result of prohibiting a landlord from filing a writ of unlawful detainer, as a device of imposing an eviction moratorium, which is a political matter. As we stated in our reply regarding the AG's note that Washington's failing economy and it's out of control homeless problem are political policy issues and do not relate to separation of power.Pursuant to RAP 18.17, I hereby certify there are 628 words in this brief as indicated by the word processing program used in preparation.Dated this 25th day of February, 2022./ss/_____________________________C Davis, Proponent, Pro Se2103 Harrison Ave NWPMB 2164Olympia, WA 98502recallinslee@gmail.comDECLARATION OFSERVICEI declare that I sent for service a true and correct copy of this pleading on all parties or their counsel of record on the datebelow as follows:Alan D.CopseyAlan.Copsy@atg.wa.govPeter B.GonickPeter.Gonick@atg.wa.govJeffrey T.EvenJeffrey.Even@atg.wa.govSent Via Email: Sent Via Email: Sent Via Email:Office of the Attorney GeneralPO Box 401001125 Washington Street SEOlympia, WA 98504-0100I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of Washington that the foregoing is true and correct.DATED this 25th day of February, 2022 at Olympia, Washington./ss/______________________________C Davis, Proponent Pro SeWASHINGTONIAN TO RECALL INSLEEFebruary 25, 2022 - 11:29 PMTransmittal InformationFiled with Court:Appellate Court Case Number: 99948-1Appellate Court Case Title:Superior Court Case Number:Supreme CourtIn the Matter of the Recall of Jay Inslee21-2-00968-2The following documents have been uploaded:• 999481_Answer_Reply_20220225232223SC758246_0606.pdf This File Contains: Answer/Reply - Other The Original File Name was 02252022 Reply NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY.pdfA copy of the uploaded files will be sent to:• • • SGOOlyEF@atg.wa.govjeffrey.even@atg.wa.govpeter.gonick@atg.wa.govComments:Reply to NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY.Sender Name: c davis - Email: recallinslee@gmail.com Address: 2103 Harrison Ave NW#2164 Olympia, WA, 98502 Phone: (360) 824-1613Note: The Filing Id is 20220225232223SC758246
