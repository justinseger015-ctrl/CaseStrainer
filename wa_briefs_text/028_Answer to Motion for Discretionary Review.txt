DOES THE COURT OF APPEALS' DECISION CONFLICT WITH THIS COURT'S DECISION IN RA TL/FF, INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, OR REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST? 2. DOES THE COURT OF APPEAL'S DECISION TO DENY RELIEF BASED ON THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST FORMER JUDGE GALLINA RAISE A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW? II.S UMMARY OF ARGUMENT 1. THE COURT'S DECISION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH RATLIFF, WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO APR 9 LEGAL INTERNS AND FITS WITHIN THE SAME LEGAL FRAMEWORK USED BY THE COURT IN THIS CASE, AND, BECAUSE THE DECISION HAS NO IMPACT ON THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IT IS NEITHER A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW NOR A SUBSTANTIAL MATTER OF PUBLIC INTEREST.BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 1 THE COURT'S DECISION DOES NOT RAISE A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION OF LAW UNDER EITHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION BECAUSE THE COURT CORRECTLY APPLIED WELL-ESTABLISHED STATE AND FEDERAL LAW IN DETERMINING THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS NOT ENTITLED TO RELIEF BASED ON THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDGE GALLINA.BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 2 Ill. STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Defendant was convicted after jury trial of Attempted Burglary in the Second Degree, Malicious Mischief in the Second Degree, and Bail Jumping (C Felony), from events occurring September 6, 2016. See State v. Ayerst, 35867-4-111, 2019 W.L. 1568060 (Unpublished). 1 The underlying facts of the case are largely immaterial and need no discussion herein. The Defendant was initially represented by John Fay, who was later replaced by attorney Robert Van · ldour who represented the Defendant through trial. See Bond Order (10/04/16) and Motion and Order Allowing Withdrawal and Substitution, submitted with the State's Response to Personal Restraint Petition. Mr. Van ldour had contracted with Asotin County and had arranged to practice under APR 8( c ), which authorizes attorneys who are I icensed by other states to appear for the purposes of public defense while they apply for a formal license to practice in Washington. Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour. Mr. Van !dour also applied for formal admission to the Washington State Bar by motion under APR 3(c). See Personal Restraint Petition Appendix A He was later notified that his application for admission by motion under APR 3(c) was accepted, 1The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 3 and that his application for limited admission under APR 8(c) had been denied. Appendix A Mr. Van ldour was, and still is, a member in good standing with the Idaho State Bar Association. Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour. More than a year after the Defendant's trial and sentencing, Judge Gallina was arrested and charged with sexual related felony and gross misdemeanor charges for actions unrelated to this trial. Those charges are currently pending. See State of Washington v. Scott D.Gallina, Asotin Superior Court Cause 19-1-00066-02. The Defendant appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in an unpublished opinion prior to Judge Gallina's arrest. See State v. Ayerst,35867-4-111, 2019 W.L. 1568060. The Defendant then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging that he had been deprived of his right to counsel, relying solely on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington. He neither argued nor demonstrated that Mr. Van ldour committed any act of misfeasance or nonfeasance, nor did he otherwise claim any prejudice therefrom. Additionally, the Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial under the appearance of fairness doctrine based on the criminal charges against former Judge Gallina. In a published decision, the Division Three of the Court of Appeals dismissed the Defendant's petition, finding that 1) the facts set forth in the Defendant's petition failed to establish that he should BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 4 be excused from showing prejudice based on a theory of structural error and the Defendant failed to allege that he was prejudiced by his attorney's representation, and 2) the Defendant failed to establish facts warranting relief from conviction based on the allegations against Judge Gallina." see Matter of Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d 356 (2021 ). The Defendant is now seeking review of the Court of Appeals' decision. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 5 IV.DISCUSSION T he decision to review a Court of Appeals decision terminating review is discretionary. RAP 13.4(a). A petition for review will be accepted by the Supreme Court only if at least one of four criteria are met. RAP 13.4(b); In re Coats, 173 Wn.2d 123, 132-33 (2011 ). Three criteria relevant to this petition are a) the decision of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with a decision by the Supreme Court, b) the petition raises a significant question under the State or Federal Constitution, and c) the petition involves a substantial public interest that should be determined by the Supreme Court. Id. Because none of these criteria are met by either claim, the Defendant's petition for review should be denied. 1. THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THIS COURT'S HOLDING IN CITY OF SEATTLE V.RA TL/FF BECAUSE THE FACTS OF THE DEFENDANT'S CASE ARE DISTINGUISHABLE IN THAT COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT WAS LICENSED IN AT LEAST ONE JURISDICTION.Generally, a defendant challenging his conviction through a Personal Restraint Petition (PRP) must show that the error raised impacted the outcome of the trial. See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Crace, 174 Wn.2d 835 (2012); In re Pers. Restraint of Finstad, 177 Wn.2d 501, 506 (2013). If the defendant cannot show that they were prejudiced by the error, then their petition is dismissed. Crace, 174 Wn.2d 847-48. An exception to the prejudice requirement exists BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 6 where there is a structural error, i.e. an error which impacts the framework of the trial process. Weaver v. Massachusetts, -U.S. - - , 137 S.Ct. 1899 (2017). Both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article 1, section 22 of the state constitution guarantee the right to counsel in a criminal case. Const. amend. VI; Const. art. 1, § 22; See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647, (2004). With regard to this right to counsel, the state constitution provides no more protection than the Sixth Amendment. State v. Medlock, 86 Wn.App. 89, 99, review denied, 133 Wn.2d 1012 (1997). Absolute denial of counsel, such as when the "attorney" was not licensed in any state at the time of representation, does not require a showing of prejudice.2 See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), aff'd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). However, lesser violations of the right to counsel do not require automatic dismissal. A defendant who is represented by a person who has been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction has not suffered from a per se Sixth Amendment violation. See, e.g.,United States v. Mitchell, 216 F.3d 1126, 1132 (D.C.Cir. 2000) ("We decline appellant's invitation to extend the per se ineffectiveness rule beyond those cases in which a defendant is 2 See, e.g.,Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629-30 (1993), citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 7 represented by a person never properly admitted to any bar.'); United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914,917 (5th Cir. 1998) ("the key to adequate representation is not technical license to· practice in the jurisdiction involved, but a credential from some forum demonstrating the specialized knowledge of a lawyer.'). A defendant who was represented by a lawyer whose license has been suspended must demonstrate actual prejudice in order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 479 F.3d 607, 61 1 (8th Cir. 2007) (suspension of a state license not per se ineffective assistance of counsel); Hardamon v. United States, 319 F.3d 943, 951 (7th Cir. 2003) (suspension of an attorney does not amount to per se ineffective assistance); State v. Edison, 61 Wn. App. 530 (1991) (defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice when represented by a lawyer who has been licensed but whose license was suspended). A defendant who was represented by an out-of-state attorney who has not been admitted pro hac vice must demonstrate actual prejudice in order to have her conviction vacated. See, e.g., Cole v. United States, 162 F.3d 957,959 (7th Cir. 1998); Kieserv. New York, 56 F .3d 16, 17 (2nd Cir. 1995) (lawyer suspended in New Jersey and not admitted pro hac vice in New York when case was tried); United States v. Costanzo, 740 F.2d 251, 258-59 (3rd Cir. 1984); Derringer BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 8 v. United States, 441 F.2d 1140, 1141 (8th Cir. 1971). These violations are considered less serious because they do not thwart the purposes of the right to counsel. As the Court of Appeals explained in Ayerst, The limited allowance for structural error is based on two considerations. "First; courts are concerned that a defendant have a counselor who has legal training and demonstrated the specialized knowledge and ability of a lawyer." Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 916. This concern was emphasized in the Washington Supreme Court's decision in Ratliff, where the defendant was represented by a law student who operated outside the parameters of the admission to practice rules applicable to law students. 100 Wash.2d at 217, 667 P.2d 630. Second, there is concern "an undisclosed lack of credentials may create a conflict of interest." Maria-Martinez, 143 F. 3d at 916. 17 Wn.App.2d at 361-62. Under these applicable standards, the Court of Appeals correctly determined that, while the Defendant had been deprived of counsel, the deprivation was not severe enough to constitute a structural error. Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d at 362. As the Court noted, Mr. Van ldour "was and is an attorney, subject to state licensing regulations," and could have qualified to provide indigent defense representation in Washington [under APR 8]." Id. at 3. Thus, the Defendant was required to demonstrate prejudice and, because he failed to do so, the Court of Appeals dismissed his PRP.Id. The Court of Appeals decision neither conflicts with City of BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 9 Seattle v. Ratliff nor undermines this Court's authority to regulate the practice of law. 100 Wn.2d 212 (1983). In Ratliff, this Court held that representation by a legal intern licensed under APR 9 ("rule 9 intern") who has been prevented from complying with that rule is a per se violation of the right to counsel. 100 Wn.2d at 221. There, the defendant was scheduled to be tried on three charges, but his court appointed counsel did not appear on the morning of trial. Id. at 213. Upon questioning the defendant, the court learned that he was being represented by a rule 9 intern, who had not completed law school and who had never been licensed to practice law in Washington or any other jurisdiction, in a different case. Id. at 213-14; see APR 9(8). Despite the fact that the rule 9 intern had no involvement with the matters set for trial, the court summoned him and, after allowing the him to speak with the defendant "must a little bit," attempted to proceed with the trial. Id. at 214. When the intern objected, the court required him over objection to proceed, but allowed the defense to delay the presentation of its case until the next business day. Id. at 214. The court did not allow the intern time to consult his supervising attorney prior to trial, as required by APR 9. Id. at 215, 220; see APR 9(D). By the time that case reached this Court, two separate issues had been raised. The defendant argued that he was denied effective BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 10 assistance of counsel because the intern was given insufficient time to prepare his case and was prevented from consulting his supervising attorney as required by APR 9. Id. at 215. In addition, the Court of Appeals, sua sponte, questioned whether representation of an indigent defendant by a law student, without the presence of a supervising attorney in court, constituted a per se violation of the right to counsel. Id. This Court first addressed . the constitutional challenge to representation by rule 9 interns. In doing so, it reminded the legal community that it has the constitutionally granted power to determine who may appear before the bar, and that this power is both "well established" and "involate." Id. at 215. Pursuant to this power, this Court promulgated and adopted the Admission to Practice Rules including APR 9, which allows "lesser qualified persons to engage in limited practice." Id. at 216. Next, this Court explained that rule 9 has several requirements, including and supervision by a qualified licensed attorney. Id. Additionally, rule 9 contains specific rules outlining the conditions under which an intern may try cases without a supervisor present. Id. Thus, this Court concluded, [a]lthough a legal intern is not an attorney, this court has established safeguards sufficient to assure that persons attaining rule 9 status will be competent to serve the needs of their clients. In light of this court's authority to determine which persons may practice in Washington state courts, and in light of the rules this BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 11 court has promulgated to assure that persons so practicing are qualified, we have held that there is no per se impropriety in allowing legal interns to appear in criminal proceedings. Id. at 216-217. Ultimately, this Court held that when rule 9 is complied with, a criminal defendant receives legal assistance "sufficient to meet with both state and federal constitutions." Id. at 218. This Court then turned to the facts of the defendant's case. Whereas a law student acting in compliance with rule 9 does qualify as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes, this Court held, "representation by a Jaw student intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal." Id. at 19 (emphasis added), citing Cheatham v. State, 364 So.2d 83, 84 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (failure to comply with requirements that supervising attorney be present and defendant be informed of student status); In re Moore, 63 III.App.3d 899, 904 (1978) (failure to inform court of student status and failure to obtain defendant's written consent); cf. People v. Masonis, 58 Mich.App. 615, 619 (1975) (/aw student representation did not violate right to counsel where defendant was aware of student status, general effective assistance of counsel standards were met, and there was no violation of student practice rules). Additionally, the Court held that where counsel is outright denied, no prejudice need be shown. Id. at 220, citing People BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 12 v. Felder, 47 N.Y.2d 287, 294 (1979) (defendants were denied effective assistance of counsel where each defendant was represented in his underlying criminal action by a person who had not completed law school and who was not, and had never been, admitted to the Bar of the State or of any other jurisdiction). Because the record demonstrated that the law student representing the defendant was prevented from complying with the requirements of APR 9 which would have otherwise qualified him as counsel, this Court held that there was a denial of the "in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 213. The Court of Appeals decision in this case does not conflict with Ratliff because the holding of Ratliff is restricted to law students practicing under APR 9 or, at the very least, representation by individuals who have never completed law school or been licensed as an attorney in any jurisdiction. In Ratliff, the question before this Court was whether a rule 9 intern, who had never been admitted to practice in any jurisdiction, could ever qualify as counsel for constitutional purposes and, if so, the conditions required for doing so. This reading is supported by the cases cited by this Court in reaching its conclusions, a majority of which discuss the practice of law by student interns in other states. Furthermore, the Defendant's argument that the Court of BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 13 Appeal's decision in his case interferes with this Court's ability to regulate the practice of law in Washington state is misplaced. Ratliff's discussion of this Court's power to regulate the practice of law is oriented towards this Court's constitutional power to decide when an individual may affirmatively be admitted to practice in Washington state. It does not necessarily follow that every individual represented by counsel acting out of compliance with the APRs is per se denied counsel. Absent the requirements of rule 9, a legal intern is comparable to a lay person because they have never been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction and, in many cases, have not yet completed their legal studies. By contrast, an attorney admissible pro hac vice under APR 8, while not licensed in Washington state, has completed their legal studies and qualified as an attorney in at least one jurisdiction. See APR B(b ). 3 Even if that attorney were to later fail to comply with the requirements of APR 8, he would still have legal training and specialized knowledge necessary to ensure a fair trial. Because the holding of Ratliff is so restricted, it fits within the same legal framework applied in the Defendant's case. As discussed above, courts draw a distinction between deprivation of counsel 3The irony is inescapable that this issue has been raised in an era where this Court suspended the bar exam and admitted over 500 law school graduates under diploma privilege. See https://news. bloom berg law .com/business-and-practice/over-1-000-new-lawyers-get-l icenses-without-taking-bar-exam. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 14 claims where the defendant's representative is not qualified to practice law in any jurisdiction, and those where the representative is qualified to practice in at least one jurisdiction, but not where the representation occurred. In Ratliff, the otherwise unlicensed law student intern was prevented from complying with the requirements of rule 9, and therefore was not qualified to practice in any jurisdiction. Thus, this Court appropriately declared the law student's representation a per se violation of the right to counsel. In the Petitoner's matter, the Court of Appeals correctly identified the distinguishing fact that Mr. Van ldour, at the time of his representation, was qualified to practice in at least one jurisdiction and appropriately required the Defendant to demonstrate prejudice. 2. THE COURT OF APPEALS' CORRECTLY CONCLUDED.UNDER WELL-ESTABLISHED FEDERAL AND STATE STANDARDS, THAT MR.A YERST'S DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS NOT VIOLATED.The Court of Appeals applied the correct standard in determining that the Defendant failed to introduce evidence that the charges against Judge Gallina created an unconstitutional risk of bias. Due Process requires that a judge recuse him or herself when "the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable. Rippo v. Baker, - - U.S. - - , - - , 137 S.Ct. 905, 907 (2017); see Williams v. Pennsylvania, 579 U.S.--,--, 136 S.Ct. 1899, 1905 BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 15 (2016). A defendant alleging a due process violation, need not demonstrate actual bias, but may argue that the facts of his or her case created an "unconsitutional risk of bias." Williams, 136 S.Ct. at 1905. This test is objective, and asks whether the judge is laboring under a conflict of interest. See, e.g., Williams, 136 S.Ct. At 1905-06 Uudge refused to recuse himself from case where he had previously authorized State to seek the death penalty as a district attorney}; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie; 475 U.S. 813 (2006) Uustice casting the deciding vote was in the process of suing an insurance company under a novel theory analogous to successful party's case). In the Defendant's case, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that "due process can require a trial judge's recusal even when the judge has not manifested any 'actual bias."' Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d at 364. The Court correctly identified the test as an objective one based on "whether, under the circumstances of a particular case, there is 'an unconstitutional potential for bias.'" Id., citing Williams, 16 S.Ct. at 1905. Later in its analysis, the Court explained that the Defendant was alleging a Due Process violation based on an unconstitutional risk of bias rather than actual bias and analyzed his claim accordingly. Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d at 365. After doing so, it determined that the Defendant's claim failed "for want of factual support." Id. This is not the same as insisting that the Defendant BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 16 show actual bias, as he claims in his brief. See Brief of Petitioner at 15. Rather, after reviewing all properly raised claims and the record before it, the Court simply concluded that the Defendant failed to sufficiently demonstrate even a risk of unconstitutional bias.4 Moreover, the Court of Appeals correctly found that the Petitioner failed to allege facts sufficient to find that he was denied the right to a fair trial under the appearance of fairness doctrine. Under the appearance of fairness doctrine, a judicial proceeding is valid if "a reasonably prudent, disinterested observer would conclude that the parties received a fair, impartial, and neutral hearing." State v. Solis, 187 Wn.2d 535,540 (2017); see a/so State v. Gamble, 168 Wn.2d 161, 187 (2010); State v. Bilal, 77 Wn.App. 720, 722 (1995). This test is objective and assumes that "a reasonable person knows and understands all the relevant facts." Tatham v. Rogers, 170 Wn.App. 76, 96 {2012), quoting Sherman v. State, 128 Wn.2d 164,206 (1995) (internal citations and quotations omitted). The trial court is presumed to perform its functions "regularly and properly without bias or prejudice." Thatham, 170 Wn.App. at 96. Therefore, the party asserting an appearance of 4 At oral argument, the Defendant claimed for the first time that Judge Gallina and Mr. Van ldour were in collusion. The Court found that the claim was both unsupported and improperly raised and refused to consider it. Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d at 365, n.2. BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 17 fairness violation must produce sufficient evidence of a judge's actual or potential bias. Id., citing In re Personal Restraint of Haynes, 100 Wn.App. 366,377 n. 23 (2000); Gamble, 168 Wn.2d at 187. Mere speculation is not enough. Tatham, 170 Wn.App. at 96, citing Haynes, 100 Wn.App. 366 (2000). Applying these standards, the Court of Appeals found that the Defendant failed to establish sufficient facts to show that the appearance of fairness doctrine was violated. Ayerst, 17 Wn.App.2d at 365. Additionally, the Court explained that even if allegations against Judge Gallina were proven true, "the judge's alleged misconduct would not provide grounds for relief from conviction unless tied to the specific circumstances of the defendant's case." Id. at 363-64. In doing so, the Court referred to its analysis in State v. Williams, where it concluded that even if the charges against Judge Gallina were true, there would be no basis for an objective observer to expect him to favor the State in that case. 15 Wn.App.2d 841 , 850 (2021) (unpublished, see GR 14.1) (appealing convictions for felony violation of a no-contact order, witness tampering, and assault). In his brief, the Defendant argues that "[c]ases involving violation of the CJC's and the appearance of fairness in non criminal cases have held behavior far less egregious than in BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 18 Ayerst's case to violate the appearance," citing to Matter of the Disciplinary Proceedings against Ralph G.Turco, Tacoma Municiple Court Judge. 137 Wn.2d 227, 239 (1999) and Dependency of A.E.T.H .• 9 Wn.App.2d 502, 517-18 (2019). Both cases are readily distinguishable. See Turco, 137 Wn.2d 227 ( concern expressed over appearance of fairness in domestic violence cases where judge was accused of assaulting wife at a public event); A.E.T.H., 9 Wn.App.2d 502 (violation of appearance of fairness where court employees committed misconduct over course of a termination case). Here, while the allegations against Judge Gallina, if true, seriously impugn his character, they fail to demonstrate what his partiality in the Defendant's case would be. Unlike in Turco, there are no similarities between the crimes for which the Defendant was convicted (Burglary, Malicious Mischief, and Bc1il Jumping) and the crimes of which Judge Gallina stands accused. Similarly, Judge Gallina's alleged misconduct was not directly tied to the Defendant's case, as was the VGAL programs in A.E.T.H.V. CONCLUSION The Court of Appeals decision in the Defendant's case does not conflict with this Court's decision in Ratliff, nor does it raise a significant question of constitutional law or an issue of substantial BRIEF OF RESPONDENT 19 public interest. Similarly, the Court of Appeals applied well established state and federal law to reach its conclusion that the Defendant was not entitled to relief based on the allegations against Judge Gallina, and thus the decision does not raise a significant question of state or federal constitutional law. Because no basis exists for review of either claim the State respectfully requests that the Defendant's Petition for Review be denied. Dated this ~ day of August, 2021 .
