II.POSITION OF AMICI This brief is filed in support of Petitioners. III.STATEMENT OF THE CASE Amicus adopts Petitioners’ statements of facts. Additional facts include that Mr. Van Idour, the lawyer whose actions are at issue in this case, stipulated to discipline and this Court added significant punishment to the punishment agreed to in the stipulation. See Appendices A and B, attached. The stipulation included that: the lawyer signed a contract with Asotin County to represent persons charged with crimes that required him to be a member of the Washington Bar Association even though he was not admitted in Washington; he “did not gain admission at any time during the term of the contract” and he knew that a judge’s order purporting to grant him limited admission did not accomplish admission to the Bar; and that he was never 1 admitted under any rule. Appendix A.He stipulated to practicing law without a license and a six-month suspension (in effect precluding any application for admission), Id., but this Court imposed instead an 18-month suspension based on the stipulation of facts. Appendix B.IV.INTRODUCTION This case involves ongoing unauthorized representation of criminal defendants in felony cases by a person hired by a county to represent indigent defendants even though he never took the necessary steps to become qualified to practice law in Washington or to meet this Court’s Standards for Public Defense, and yet held himself out as qualified. Contrary to the Court of Appeals’ conclusion and the County’s arguments here, this situation did fundamentally undermine Petitioners’ constitutional right to counsel recognized in City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn. 2d 212, 667 P.2d 630 (1983), and requires a finding of actual denial of counsel without any need to show additional prejudice. 2 V.ARGUMENT The flouting of all rules and standards regarding the A. practice of law and public defense representation fundamentally undermined Petitioners’ right to be represented by the “counsel” required by the Constitution. In Ratliff, this Court discussed at length its inherent and plenary constitutional power to determine the conditions under which persons may practice law in this state. 100 Wn.2d at 215-216. Since Ratliff, this Court has made much more specific the qualifications for persons representing the accused at public expense. In the exercise of its powers to promulgate mandatory court rules and its corollary powers to regulate the practice of law, the Court has established detailed qualifications that criminal defense counsel must possess and publicly certify they meet. See “Standards for Indigent Defense” promulgated “to address certain basic elements of public defense related to the effective assistance of counsel” CrR 3.1 Stds (Preamble). Standard 14 requires that all persons representing criminal defendants at public expense meet “minimum professional qualifications,” and, not surprisingly, the first one listed is: 3 “Satisfy the minimum requirements for practicing law in Washington as determined by the Washington Supreme Court.” In addition to many other requirements listed in Standard 14 (including familiarity with court rules), counsel covered by these standards must certify quarterly that they meet all of the qualifications this Court has established. This Court recently discussed duties under the Indigent Defense Standards: Court rules […] provide, “Before appointing a lawyer for an indigent person, or at the first appearance of the lawyer in the case, the court shall require the lawyer to certify to the court that he or she complies with the applicable Standards for Indigent Defense Services.” CrR 3.1(d)(4); CrRLJ 3.1(d)(4); JuCR 9.2(d). Our standards for indigent defense apply to any attorney appointed by the court to provide public defense representation. Davison v. State of Washington, 196 Wn.2d 285, 298-99, 466 P. 3d 231 (2020)(emphasis added). The Indigent Defense Standards and the general Admission to Practice Rules show that this Court has acted deliberately to establish clear rules governing not only general 4 qualifications for all who wish to practice law in Washington, but also very specific qualifications—grounded in the need to protect the constitutional right to counsel—for persons representing the accused at public expense. Sadly, the record in this case demonstrates that none of the Court’s relevant rules were complied with. This Court’s Standards for Public Defense are mandatory court rules. Contrary to the County’s claims here (Supplemental Br. at 18-20), these rules are not the same as the professional standards and guidelines for the practice of criminal defense such as those that this court held in State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 225 P.3d 956 (2010) were evidence of, but not conclusive of, the question of effective assistance of counsel. 168 Wn.2d 109-110. These are court rules that establish minimums required to be qualified counsel to undertake representation of criminal defendants as a public defender in Washington.1 1 The Court of Appeals in State v. Flores, 197 Wn.App.1, 386 P.3d 298 (2016), rev denied, 188 Wn.2d 1003 (2017), failed to recognize this crucial distinction and incorrectly equated the 5 Concurring in Davison, then-Justice González recounted the history of cases alleging systemic failures to provide adequate counsel in the state over many years, and how this Court’s rules establishing specific requirements for the practice of public defense grew out of the information obtained through those cases. The common thread running through all of these cases is that the counties and cities involved have opted not to provide public defense through dedicated public defense offices that would provide the supervision, oversight and training that prevent systemic failures of counsel. Instead, the jurisdictions that have generated serious claims of the failure of the system to provide adequate defense counsel have employed contract lawyers—including in Davison itself and the present case—to provide public defense.2 This history shows that the contract professional guidelines discussed in A.N.J. with this Court’s mandatory rules. 197 Wn.App. 13-15. This Court’s public defense rules and standards were promulgated after A.N.J. and are far more than professional guidelines and recommendations. 2 In addition to the present case and Davison, see Best v. Grant County, cited in Davison, 196 Wn.2d at 305 (concurrence); 6 system is a major weakness in the state’s public defense system that has unfortunately spawned multiple systemic failures of counties and cities to provide adequate counsel. In addition, as the Court majority recounted in detail in Davison, 196 Wn.2d at 297-98, the Legislature has required that cities and counties must each adopt standards for public defense “safeguarding the right to counsel” that include many subjects but most importantly “attorney qualifications,” and “training, supervision, evaluation and monitoring of attorneys.” RCW 10.101.030. This Court said that this statute creates a duty to “adopt, implement, and administer” these standards, and appropriately placed special emphasis on implementation of supervision and monitoring by pointing to the Court’s Standard For Indigent Defense 11’s call to “establish a procedure for systematic monitoring and evaluation of attorney performance…” Id. at 298. The purpose of all of these A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d at 100; Wilbur v. City of Mt. Vernon¸ 989 F.Supp.2d 1122 (W.D.Wash. 2013); Flores, 197 Wn.App. at 5. 7 standards is to protect an indigent defendant’s right to counsel as defined in our state. These essential functions recognized both by this Court and the Legislature were absent in the current cases-leaving the County to feel free to hire a person unqualified to practice law in Washington State as a public defender. There is no evidence in the record that anything resembling enforcement of any of the standards was occurring in Asotin County. The contract attorney was not even properly licensed to practice law in Washington, but county officials, the court, and the prosecutor nevertheless allowed him to continue to represent defendants, utterly without the necessary “training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation.” And surely “attorney qualifications” of counsel under the statute must include this Court’s rules for the practice of law and the Court’s very specific rules requiring particular qualifications for representing criminal defendants, but these were being egregiously flouted. Neither Mr. Van Idour nor Asotin County and its officials, who issued the contract, 8 complied with their clear duties to make sure that these standards and requirements were complied with.3 The serious policy question whether the contract system should be eliminated is not before this Court. However, what is before the Court is whether a contract attorney such as Mr. Van Idour, who fails to meet the minimum requirements for practice in Washington, and who repeatedly committed the crime of practicing without a license and knowingly failed to follow the Rules of Professional Conduct and Admission to Practice Rules, can be considered constitutionally-required “counsel” in any meaningful sense. 3 In addition to all of these problems that are so clear on this record, the contract system can create a lack of independence of public defense from judges and other public officials. Certainly public defense systems must be accountable to public officials, but independence of public defense from the pressures that can sometimes be brought to bear by public officials is essential to the proper functioning of the system. The Legislature recognized this in part through RCW 10.101.040, which prohibits prosecutors and law enforcement officers from selecting public defenders, but unfortunately pressures can also be brought to bear by county elected officials and even judges. 9 If such a person can be considered counsel and allowed to represent people accused of felonies, these statutes and rules are of no practical effect. Counsel from other states could do the same, or worse, with impunity. Respectfully, the rules call out for enforcement to protect defendants, and more than just sanctioning counsel is needed where, as here, simply asking counties, judges and counsel to please follow the rules that are designed to protect the constitutional right to counsel is not enough. Amicus does not suggest that any small technical violation of these rules and standards, such as a properly-admitted Washington attorney failing to file a report, would equal a total denial of counsel. However, this Court should find there has been a complete denial of counsel when, as here, there was a total lack of following of—or enforcement of—any of these rules allowing someone never licensed in Washington to pretend to be a qualified lawyer and to be substantively deceptive about that—keeping the reality from his clients as well as knowingly 10 violating the ethical and admission rules and the criminal law. This total failure of both the lawyer involved and of the court and county that are specifically charged with the crucial duty of protecting the right to counsel by making sure minimum standards are in place and enforced equals a denial of the “counsel” required by the Constitution. B.This fundamental deprivation of the “counsel” required by the Constitution requires relief. The denial of counsel in Mr. Ayerst’s and Mr. Lewis’s cases is the kind of constitutional error that, even on collateral review, “…give[s] rise to a conclusive presumption of prejudice…” In re Richardson, 100 Wn.2d 669, 679, 675 P.2d 209 (1983). In Richardson, the error for which prejudice was presumed was acting as a lawyer for both a criminal defendant and a witness in the same case, creating a conflict of interest that fundamentally undermined the right to counsel. In Ratliff, it was the failure of a lawyer admitted to practice in Washington to be present to defend the accused, another species of fundamental undermining of the right to counsel. 11 The present case, like Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983), contains both types of fatal compromise of the right to counsel. As in Solina, the lawyer in the present case was committing a crime, thus inherently compromising his required undivided loyalty to his client. And even more so than in Ratliff¸ where the legal intern was faithfully trying to follow the rules but was prevented from doing so, the lawyer in this case was not authorized to do what he did: he was not admitted or authorized to practice in Washington, could not honestly and did not certify his compliance with the rules that applied specifically to public defenders, and failed to disclose these facts to his clients. On this record, prejudice must be presumed without more. The County tries to distinguish Ratliff and Solina (and doesn’t mention Richardson) by incorrectly suggesting that all courts in other jurisdictions find an outright deprivation of counsel requiring relief only in cases in which someone who has never been admitted to practice in any jurisdiction represents a 12 defendant, no matter how egregious the flouting of the rules of the state in which the representation occurs. On the contrary, circumstances matter: courts have found a fundamental deprivation of counsel requiring relief in many situations where a lawyer who was or had been licensed was involved. See People v. Kenny, 30 P.3d 734, 742-44 (Colo. Court of Appeals 2000)(discussion of approaches and factors that have been considered in different states regarding whether per se rule will be applied when counsel has been suspended from practice). See also, e.g., McKinzie v. Ellis, 287 F.2d 549 (5th Cir. 1961)(even lawyer disqualified for continued bar membership only for nonpayment of dues not considered to be “counsel” in a capital case; court referenced Texas state case finding that a lawyer who was not current on dues is not “counsel” under state right to counsel statute); People v. Chin Min Foo, 144 Misc.2d 589, 545 N.Y.S. 55 (1989)(lawyer was licensed but obtained license through fraud). A rule that, no matter how egregious the violation of state rules, any lawyer who has ever been licensed will do 13 would of course make no sense and would be inconsistent with Washington precedent. It would also be contrary to the Washington Constitution, which, as outlined in Ratliff, vests power in this Court alone to determine and ensure any person practicing in our courts meets the minimum criteria to be entitled to appear in court. This Court underscored its commitment to ensuring that only those properly authorized to practice law in Washington may be considered “counsel” when it imposed significant additional punishment on Mr. Van Idour beyond what he agreed to in his stipulation with the Bar Association. Exhibit B.All of this Court’s rules and relevant legislation lead in the same direction: Persons such as Mr. Van Idour cannot be considered constitutionally-required “counsel” in Washington, where they fail to meet the minimum requirements for practice and make no serious efforts to obtain it. Under these circumstances, no further prejudice need be shown. 14 Direct application of Richardson, Ratliff, and Solina and this Court’s rules should lead to relief here without a further showing of prejudice. But even applying a case-by-case approach as some other states do would show that the violations and conduct in the present case went to the heart of the reasons for jealous protection of the right to counsel and require relief. Especially in light of this Court’s rules for indigent defense and the Legislature’s insistence on standards that counties and cities are bound to enforce discussed above, this was a deprivation of counsel requiring relief without any further showing. The County also suggests that Ratliff’s conclusion that the deprivation of counsel there required automatic reversal does not apply in this personal restraint proceeding, and that the Petitioners must show prejudice in the conduct of the trial. Supplemental Br. 8-10. But as shown above, this Court’s cases say that a deprivation of the “counsel” required by the Constitution is the kind of fundamental error that requires automatic relief on collateral attack as well as on direct appeal. 15 Furthermore, there should be no requirement to show further prejudice here because the Petitioners could not have raised this structural defect on direct appeal as they did not know about Mr. Van Idour’s failure to be a qualified Washington attorney in time to raise it on direct appeal. Petitioners should be deemed to be in the same position as Ratliff: In Ratliff, the defect was apparent on the face of the trial record and thus could be raised on direct appeal, while Petitioners raised the issue in their personal restraint petitions as soon as they could because the defect was not on the record. Their showing that they were not provided the “counsel” required by the Constitution must be presumed prejudicial on this record.4 The deprivation of counsel here requires relief without further showing. 4 See, e.g., In re Personal Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 677, 327 P.3d 660 (2014)(where there has been no opportunity for previous review, “the petitioner need show only that he is restrained under RAP 16.4(b) and that the restraint is unlawful under RAP 16.4(c).”) 16 VI.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, this Court should find that the deprivation of counsel was of constitutional magnitude and was of such a fundamental nature that a separate showing of prejudice is not required, vacate Petitioners’ convictions, and remand for a new trial.

Respondent Robert Jerry Van Idour was admitted to the practice of law in the State of Idaho on September 25, 1980. 2. Respondent has never been admitted to the practice of law in the State of Washington. II.STIPULATED FACTS 3. On December 13, 2016, Respondent submitted a letter of interest to the Asotin 10 County, Washington Board of Commissioners seeking a contract to provide indigent defense 11 services in the county. 12 4. Respondent’s letter stated that he was in the process of applying for admission to 13 practice law in Washington. 14 15 16 5. On January 16, 2017, Respondent submitted an application for admission by motion to the WSBA under Washington Admission and Practice Rule (APR) 3(c). 6. Respondent was awarded the indigent defense contract with Asotin County (the 17 “contract”). 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 7. On January 29, 2017, Respondent signed the contract. 8. The contract required Respondent to be a member of the WSBA throughout its term, which ran from February 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018. 9. Respondent was not admitted to practice law in Washington at the time he executed the contract and did not gain admission at any time during the term of the contract. 10. During the term of the contract, Respondent was appointed to represent over 100 Stipulation to Discipline Page 2 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL OF THE WASHINGTON STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 1325 4th Avenue, Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98101-2539 (206) 727-8207 1 clients in Asotin County Superior Court. 2 11. On February 20, 2017, Respondent submitted an application for limited admission 3 to the WSBA under APR 8(c). 4 5 12. That application was never approved. 13. On October 6, 2017, Asotin County Superior Court Judge Scott Gallina signed an 6 Order for Limited Admission to Practice (the “Order”) that purported to provisionally admit 7 Respondent in Asotin County “for the purpose of providing indigent defense services in 8 accordance with APR 8.” 9 10 11 14. The Order was dated “Nunc Pro Tunc to February 1, 2017.” 15. The Order did not constitute admission to practice law in Washington. 16. Respondent knew that the Order did not constitute admission to practice law in 12 Washington. 13 17. On or about October 26, 2017, Respondent received notice that his application for 14 admission by motion under APR 3(c) was approved and that Respondent was required to 15 complete additional steps prior to gaining admission. 16 18. The approval of the application did not constitute admission to practice law in 17 Washington. 18 19. Respondent knew that the approval of the application did not constitute admission 19 to practice law in Washington. 20 20. Respondent was never admitted to practice law in Washington on the basis of his 21 application for admission by motion under APR 3(c). 22 21. On or about November 27, 2017, Respondent received notice that his application 23 for limited admission under APR 8(c) was denied because he did not meet the criteria for 24 Stipulation to Discipline Page 3 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL OF THE WASHINGTON STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 1325 4th Avenue, Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98101-2539 (206) 727-8207 1 limited admission under that rule. 2 22. Respondent was never admitted or authorized to practice law in Washington on 3 any other basis. 4 23. Respondent states he believed he was authorized to practice in Asotin County 5 Superior Court because he had applied for admission under APR 3(c) and 8(c) and because the 6 court appointed him as counsel beginning in February 2017. 7 24. Respondent agrees that neither the pending applications nor the court appointments 8 authorized him to practice and that he should have confirmed his authority to practice during the 9 term of the contract. 10 11 III.STIPULATION TO MISCONDUCT 25. By practicing law in Washington without authorization, Respondent violated RPC 12 5.5(a) and RPC 5.5(b). 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 IV.PRIOR DISCIPLINE 26. Respondent has no record of prior discipline. V.APPLICATION OF ABA STANDARDS 27. The following American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 ed. & Feb. 1992 Supp.) apply to this case: 7.0 Violations of Duties Owed as a Professional Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances, upon application of the factors set out in Standard 3.0, the following sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services, improper communication of fields of practice, improper solicitation of professional employment from a prospective client, unreasonable or improper fees, unauthorized practice of law, improper withdrawal from representation, or failure to report professional misconduct. 7.1 Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional with the intent to obtain a benefit for the lawyer or another, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client, the public, or the legal system. Stipulation to Discipline Page 4 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL OF THE WASHINGTON STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 1325 4th Avenue, Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98101-2539 (206) 727-8207 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 7.2 Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system. 7.3 Reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer negligently engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system. 7.4 Admonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in an isolated instance of negligence that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional, and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system. 28. Respondent acted knowingly. 29. Respondent’s conduct caused potential injury to his clients and the legal system. 30. The presumptive sanction is suspension under ABA Standard 7.2. 31. The following aggravating factor applies under ABA Standard 9.22: (i) substantial experience in the practice of law (admitted in 1980). 32. The following mitigating factors apply under ABA Standard 9.32: (a) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (g) character or reputation; and (l) remorse. 33. On balance, the aggravating and mitigating factors do not require a departure from the presumptive sanction. VI.STIPULATED DISCIPLINE 34. The parties stipulate that Respondent shall receive a six-month suspension for his conduct. 35. Because Respondent is not currently licensed in Washington, the parties further stipulate that Respondent shall be enjoined from practicing law in Washington or from seeking admission to practice law in Washington in any form during the period of suspension. Stipulation to Discipline Page 5 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL OF THE WASHINGTON STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 1325 4th Avenue, Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98101-2539 (206) 727-8207 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 VII.RESTITUTION 36. No restitution is required by this stipulation. VIII.COSTS AND EXPENSES 37. Respondent shall pay attorney fees and administrative costs of $500 in accordance with ELC 13.9(i). The WSBA will seek a money judgment under ELC 13.9(l) if these costs are not paid within 30 days of approval of this stipulation. Reinstatement from suspension and eligibility for admission to practice law in Washington in any form is conditioned on payment of costs. IX.VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT 38. Respondent states that prior to entering into this Stipulation he has consulted independent legal counsel regarding this Stipulation, that Respondent is entering into this Stipulation voluntarily, and that no promises or threats have been made by ODC, the WSBA, nor by any representative thereof, to induce Respondent to enter into this Stipulation except as 14 provided herein. 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 39. Once fully executed, this Stipulation is a contract governed by the legal principles applicable to contracts, and may not be unilaterally revoked or modified by either party. X.LIMITATIONS 40. This Stipulation is a compromise agreement intended to resolve this matter in accordance with the purposes of lawyer discipline while avoiding further proceedings and the expenditure of additional resources by the Respondent and ODC.Both Respondent and ODC acknowledge that the result after further proceedings in this matter might differ from the result 22 agreed to herein. 41. This Stipulation is not binding upon ODC or Respondent as a statement of all 23 24 Stipulation to Discipline Page 6 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL OF THE WASHINGTON STATE BAR ASSOCIATION 1325 4th Avenue, Suite 600 Seattle, WA 98101-2539 (206) 727-8207 1 existing facts relating to the professional conduct of the respondent lawyer, and any additional 2 existing facts may be proven in any subsequent disciplinary proceedings. 3 42.
