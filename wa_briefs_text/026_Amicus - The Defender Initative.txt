The Initiative is part of the Fred T.Korematsu Center for Law and Equality at Seattle University School of Law, whose mission is to advance justice and equality through a unified vision that combines research, advocacy, and education. The first major projects of the Initiative included a report on misdemeanor practice in conjunction with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers entitled “Minor Crimes, Massive Waste”, and a project funded by the Foundation to Promote Open Society to increase access to counsel in misdemeanor courts in several states. For the past several years, the Initiative has worked with The Sixth Amendment Center on evaluations of public defense in several states, including current projects in Illinois and New Hampshire. This work is funded by a grant from the United States Department of Justice. The Defender Initiative has a deep interest and significant experience in right to counsel issues. The Director of the Defender Initiative, Robert C.Boruchowitz, has worked on defender standards nationally and in Washington State for more than 30 years. He is an 1 emeritus member of the Washington State Bar Council on Public Defense, for which he chairs the Standards Committee. He has written and spoken widely about the right to counsel, and was Director of The Defender Association in Seattle for 28 years and President of the Washington Defender Association for 20 years before joining the Seattle University School of Law faculty in January 2007. He is a Professor from Practice and has taught Criminal Procedure-Adjudicative, a Right to Counsel seminar, and the Youth Advocacy Clinic. He led a committee that developed the American Council of Chief Defenders Statement on Caseloads and Workloads in 2007. In 2003, he was a Soros Senior Fellow working on issues related to right to counsel in misdemeanor courts. He was amicus counsel in City of Mt. Vernon v. Weston, 68 Wn. App. 411(1992), the first published Washington appellate court opinion to refer to defender standards. Professor Boruchowitz has been an expert witness in systemic litigation concerning effective public defense representation in Washington, New York, and Louisiana. The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division found that he qualifies as an expert “on the operation of indigent defense systems and the evaluation of such systems in light of prevailing professional standards.” Hurrell-Harring v. State, 119 A.D.3d 1052, 1053, 990 N.Y.S.2d 286, 288 (N.Y.App. Div. 2014). 2 The amicus incorporates by reference the full statement of interest in the Motion to File an Amicus Brief herein. The Defender Initiative does not, in this brief or otherwise, represent the official views of Seattle University or its School of Law. II.Introduction. Mr. Ayerst was convicted at a trial in which he was represented by a lawyer who was not admitted to the Washington Bar. Matter of Ayerst, __Wn.App.2d__,486 P.3d 943 (Wash. Ct. App. 2021). The Court of Appeals erred when it rejected his claim that the failure to provide licensed counsel was structural error. While the Court cited Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984), it misapprehended the teaching of that case concerning prevailing professional norms and its application in Washington. Prevailing professional norms in Washington require compliance with Cr.R. 3.1 Stds. The unlicensed lawyer, Robert Van Idour, did not comply with the rule. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that state and federal constitutional protections to the right to counsel are undermined when trial counsel is engaged in criminal activity. Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d at 945. But it found that Mr. Ayerst had not provided sufficient proof of the criminal conduct of his trial lawyer, speculating the lawyer, who appeared on behalf of more than 100 accused persons in nine months, might have 3 been confused. (Id. at 947.) This analysis ignored the fact that unlawful practice of law is a strict liability crime. State v. Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d 155, 177 (2020). The Court of Appeals ignored the teaching of State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91 (2010), and the history of standards adopted by this Court as explained in Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 297 (2020). The Court of Appeals found no evidence that the lawyer intentionally failed to comply with the Admission to Practice Rules. In fact, it appears that the unlicensed lawyer violated the misdemeanor of unlawful practice of law, which is a strict liability crime. While confusion might be a defense in a bar discipline case, it does not overcome a strict liability criminal prosecution. The logical inference from the Court’s analysis is that if the lawyer had purposely evaded Washington’s licensing requirements, he would have had a conflict of interest that interfered with representation of Mr. Ayerst. Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d at 947. Even though he had applied for admission to the Washington Bar, Mr. Van Idour’s application was never finally approved. The Court speculated that Mr. Van Idour could have been licensed under APR 8. But while the Court of Appeals wrote that the unlicensed lawyer was “supervised” by a Washington lawyer, which is required under APR 8, in fact the pleadings in Mr. Ayerst’s case were signed only by Mr. Van 4 Idour, without a bar number, and no Washington attorney was “of record” as required by APR 8.1 The rule requires that the Washington attorney be the lawyer of record and responsible for the conduct of the matter. The Court of Appeals also misapprehended the holding of City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wash.2d 212 (1983). The Court acknowledged, citing Ratliff, that “because Mr. Ayerst's attorney was not licensed in Washington, he did not have ‘counsel’ as that term is defined for constitutional purposes.” Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d at 946. But the Court veered into an analysis of federal cases about lawyers licensed in other states, and did not adequately address the Ratliff holding. This Court has responded to the well-documented problems in public defense in the state by adopting court rules that require certain standards to be met and certificates of compliance to be filed. Davison, 196 Wn.2d at 298–99. But these rules did not protect Mr. Ayerst because his unlicensed lawyer in this case did not comply with the standards or timely submit certificates of compliance. 1 “In any such matter, litigation, or administrative proceeding, the applicant shall be associated with an active lawyer member of the Bar, who shall be the lawyer of record and responsible for the conduct of the matter, litigation, or administrative proceeding.” APR 8 (c )(2) 5 While Mr. Van Idour was admitted in Idaho, he did not comply with Washington’s rules and Mr. Ayerst was deprived of a lawyer who met the Standards required to represent indigent clients. This Court has made clear that the bar admission process is not a meaningless formality. “The court’s ultimate responsibility in matters relating to admission of attorneys is to guard the public and its confidence in the judicial system.” Matter of Simmons, 190 Wn.2d 374, 387 (2018). This Court should grant the Personal Restraint Petition. Mr. Ayerst’s lawyer was not admitted to the bar, he likely committed unlawful practice of law, and the APR’s purpose of protection was thwarted. This Court’s aim of protecting public defense clients by implementing the court rule on standards also was thwarted. III.Statement of the Case. On or about January 16, 2017, Mr. Van Idour submitted an application for admission to the state bar, pursuant to APR 3(c). 2 Approximately a month earlier, he had sought a public defense contract in Asotin County.3 On January 29, 2017, Mr. Van Idour signed an indigent defense contract with Asotin County.4 The contract required him to be 2 Formal Complaint, Disciplinary Board of the Washington Supreme Court, In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, Proceeding No. 19#00008, April 19, 2019. 3 Id. 4 Formal Complaint, In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, supra. 6 admitted to the Washington bar. 5 Mr. Van Idour was never admitted to practice in Washington. 6 On March 28, 2017, the trial court appointed Mr. Van Idour to represent Robert Ayerst. CP 36. On October 6, 2017, former Asotin County Superior Court Judge Scott Galina signed an Order for Limited Admission to Practice that purported to admit Mr. Van Idour provisionally to provide indigent defense services in Asotin County. The order was dated “Nunc Pro Tunc to February 1, 2017.”7 On or about October 26, 2017, the WSBA advised Mr. Van Idour that his application for admission under APR 3 (c) was approved, contingent on completing additional steps.8 Mr. Ayerst was convicted by a jury of attempted burglary in the second degree, malicious mischief in the second degree, and bail jumping on November 17, 2017. CP 98. 5 Mr. Van Idour is now an inactive member of the Idaho State Bar. Idaho Attorney Roster Search, https://isb.idaho.gov/licensing-mcle/attorney-roster-search/, last checked June 19, 2021. Mr. Van Idour had been licensed to practice law in Idaho for approximately 30 years. 6 Complaint, supra. 7 Id. 8 Complaint, supra. 7 On or about November 27, 2017, Mr. Van Idour was notified that his application under APR 8(c) was denied.9 10 On December 18, 2017, Mr. Ayerst was sentenced to 55.5 months in prison. Matter of Ayerst, supra; State v. Ayerst, 8 Wn. App. 2d 1028 (2019) (unpublished opinion). On April 19, 2019, the WSBA filed a formal complaint against Mr. Van Idour, alleging that he was not authorized to practice law in Washington as an out-of-state attorney.11. Mr. Van Idour appeared for more than100 accused persons under his Asotin contract.12 Approximately three months after his contract began, Mr. Van Idour submitted an application for limited admission to the WSBA under APR 8 (c), 13 which permits attorneys working in public defense and who are eligible to apply for admission under APR 3, upon application and approval, to practice law in Washington but with two important conditions that Mr. Van Idour did not meet. Under APR 8 (c), that lawyer must be associated with an active member of the Washington bar “who shall be the lawyer of record and responsible for the conduct of the matter”. The 9 Complaint, supra. 10 Id. As documented in the email in the appendix below, Mr. Van Idour on October 30, 2017, told the Asotin County superior court administrator that he did not have a bar number and he had to answer an 80-question open book exam. 11 Complaint, Disciplinary Board of the Washington Supreme Court, In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, Proceeding No. 19#00008, April 19, 2019. 12 Id. 13 Id. 8 applicant must apply for and take the first available bar examination after the date the applicant was granted authorization to practice under the rule or have filed an application for admission by motion of Uniform Bar Exam score transfer. APR 8 (c). Mr. Van Idour admitted to the Washington State Bar (WSBA) that he was not a member of the WSBA but said whether he was admitted to the practice of law “and/or did not gain admission during the term of the contract is a question of law which” he was not required to admit or deny.14 He asserted that “the court repeatedly appointed” him “to represent specific indigent defendants” 15and that based on that he “believed this was a proper admission to practice for those matters.”16 He claimed that he had been admitted “on a pro hac vice basis”.17 Mr. Van Idour was never admitted to practice law in Washington under any rule.18 IV.Argument A.Summary The Admission to Practice Rules and the Criminal Rule on Standards for Indigent Defense require that counsel be admitted and that 14 Answer to Disciplinary Board, No.19#00008, filed June 6, 2019. 15 The judge who appointed him is no longer on the bench and is facing multiple felony charges. See, “Gallina Asking for Another Delay to Trial”, Lewiston Tribune, March 3, 2021, at https://lmtribune.com/northwest/gallina-asking-for-another-delay-to-trial/article_9e29af2e-0fee-58da-82bb-a915ffbe8669.html. 16 Answer, supra. 17 Id. 18 Complaint, supra. 9 counsel file quarterly certificates of compliance. The appointed counsel was never admitted and filed only one certificate of compliance in ten months, after Mr. Ayerst’s trial. His attempt to be admitted pro hac vice months after his appointment to represent Mr. Ayerst did not comply with the rules and was rejected by the State Bar. To permit a conviction under such circumstances to stand would drastically undermine the APR and the Standards, which are designed to protect the public. B.The Appointed Counsel Did Not Comply With the Required Court Rules on Indigent Defense Representation In reversing a juvenile conviction because of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court discussed the statute that requires each county to adopt public defense standards. State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 113 (2010). The Court rejected the argument that the WSBA standards had been incorporated into the statutes, noting that the law in 2004 when A.N.J. pled guilty provided that the bar association endorsed standards “may serve as guidelines to local legislative authorities in adopting standards.” The Court said it was not adopting the standards, but they could be considered in determining effective assistance of counsel. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 110. But in 2005, the statute was changed to read “should serve as guidelines to local legislative authorities in adopting standards.” RCW 10.101.030. 10 And effective October 1, 2012, the Court adopted standards and a required “Certification of Appointed Counsel of Compliance with Standards.” CrR 3.1 Stds. The certification states in part: “I meet the minimum basic professional qualifications in Standard 14.1.” Standard 14.1 provides in part that attorneys providing defense services shall “Satisfy the minimum requirements for practicing law in Washington as determined by the Washington Supreme Court;” As then Chief Justice Madsen wrote in July 2012, we have learned that in areas of our state, the promise of access to effective assistance of counsel promised by our constitution has not been met and that we needed to take new measures to fully enact the rights and protections due to those who enter the criminal justice system.19 She added that the changes regarding certification and caseload guidelines “are necessary to address documented ongoing flaws in indigent defense programs throughout the state.’20 When Mr. Van Idour represented Mr. Ayerst without complying with the Standards and the court rule, he thwarted this Court’s efforts to protect Mr. Ayerst’s right to counsel. Reversing the convictions in this case will make it clear that the Court intends to enforce the Standards it has adopted. 19 Chief Justice Barbara Madsen, “Enacting Standards for public defenders is a difficult but necessary balancing act”, Full Court Press, July 2012. 20 Id. 11 The “prevailing professional norms” referenced in Strickland, supra, in Washington are guided by the Standards. This Court in Davison discussed the Standards and emphasized the court rule that provides: Before appointing a lawyer for an indigent person, or at the first appearance of the lawyer in the case, the court shall require the lawyer to certify to the court that he or she complies with the applicable Standards for Indigent Defense Services. CrR 3.1(d)(4). Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 298–99. There is nothing in the record to show that the trial judge complied with this court rule. But it is unlikely, as Mr. Van Idour did not comply with CrR3.1 STDS that requires a quarterly certification of compliance with the standards for public defense adopted by the Supreme Court. First, he only filed one certification during 2017 in Asotin County, on December 1, 2017, on which he circled “3rd” before “Calendar Quarter”.21 Second, he certified that he met the minimum basic professional qualifications in Standard 14.1, but that was not true, as 14.1 provides: Standard 14.1. In order to assure that indigent accused receive the effective assistance of counsel to which they are constitutionally entitled, attorneys providing defense services shall meet the following minimum professional qualifications: A.Satisfy the minimum requirements for practicing law in Washington as determined by the Washington Supreme Court; … 21 See email from Asotin County Clerk, June 18, 2021, and copy of the Certification, in Appendix. 12 Third, he left blank the first line on the certification regarding what percentage of his total practice was devoted to indigent defense cases. And, as with every other pleading he filed in this case, he left the WSBA# blank, as he did not have one. The Lack of Regulatory Review Resulted C. in Not Discovering Past Deficiencies in the Lawyer’s Public Defense Practice Without some regulatory review of a bar applicant, past indicators of problems are overlooked. In 2010, The National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) wrote a critical evaluation of public defense in Idaho, and highlighted Nez Perce County as an example of the problems.22 Mr. Van Idour’s firm had the county’s public defense contract, both for direct representation and for overseeing the conflict lawyers. The report found “near unanimous agreement” among the county’s judges “that there is not a single thing about the public defense system in their county that they believe is worth replicating anywhere else.”23 In a paragraph that underscores the importance of the Washington Standards designed to protect defender clients, NLADA reported: 22 NLADA, “The Guarantee of Counsel: Advocacy & Due Process in Idaho’s Trial Courts,” http://www.righttocounselproject.org/sites/default/files/id_guaranteeofcounseljseri01-2010_report.pdf, p.10. 23 Id. 13 The district and magistrate judges all with one voice expressed concern that public defense clients do not receive high quality representation. Their biggest complaint is they do not believe the public defenders meet with their clients in advance of appearing in court, but instead they believe these public defenders meet with their clients primarily only at the courthouse. Though most criminal justice system stakeholders agree Fitzgerald and Van Idour “have a wealth of experience,” the big complaint is their lack of day-to-day communication with their clients. 24 In that context, Mr. Ayerst’s letter to the trial judge May 28, 2017, provides additional support for holding that the failure to have a licensed Washington attorney requires reversal of the conviction. Asking that he be released or the charges against him be dismissed, Mr. Ayerst stated, “I wrote Mr. Van Idour for almost two week[sic] with no answer.”25 As Division II of the Court of Appeals has written, when people holding themselves out as lawyers are not adequately “regulated, the dangers to the public are manifest....” State v. Hunt, 75 Wn. App. 795, 803, 880 P.2d 96, 100 (1994), citing Dauphin Cty. Bar Ass'n v. Mazzacaro, 465 Pa. 545, 551, 351 A.2d 229, 232 (1976). It appears that Mr. Van Idour violated the misdemeanor of D. practicing law without a license Practicing law without a license in Washington is a gross misdemeanor. RCW 2.48.180(3). It is a strict liability offense. State v. Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d 155, 177 (2020). No proof of intent is required. A 24 Id, at 60. 25 This letter is provided in full in the Appendix. 14 factual finding that the defendant’s actions constitute the practice of law and that the defendant was never admitted to the WSBA is sufficient to convict. In holding that the crime is a strict liability offense, this Court noted the lack of protection for clients of unlawfully practicing lawyers: When lawfully practicing attorneys cause harm, malpractice insurance and the victims’ compensation fund can provide some relief for their clients. By contrast, the unlawful practice of law often causes harm without any of the protections for malpractice by lawyers. Because these harms are predictable, the unlawful practice of law is a crime. Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d at 160. The court expressed concern for the victims of unlawful lawyer practice: “Victims in this case became homeless, were jailed, and lost almost everything they owned.” Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d at160. The Court noted that the statute prohibiting unlawful practice of law “protects the public from the harm of poor legal advice. Society might reasonably expect those unlicensed to practice law should not practice law.” Id., at 168 [footnote omitted]. RCW 2.48.180(2)(a) provides: “The following constitutes unlawful practice of law: (a) A nonlawyer practices law, or holds himself or herself out as entitled to practice law;…” 15 Mr. Van Idour meets the definition of “nonlawyer” in RCW 2.38.180(1)(b): “a person who is not an active member in good standing of the state bar….” There is no question that Mr. Van Idour was practicing law by providing legal advice and filing trial motions and legal documents and appearing in court on behalf of accused persons. While the WSBA case against Mr. Van Idour has not yet been resolved, Mr. Van Idour admits in his answer to the WSBA complaint that he had not been admitted to the WSBA pursuant to APR 3(c) or APR 8(c). Instead, Mr. Van Idour asserts that he was admitted on a pro hac vice basis. 26 Washington permits pro hac vice representation, but Mr. Van Idour did not meet the requirements of the rule: A lawyer admitted in another United States jurisdiction, and not disbarred or suspended from practice in any jurisdiction, may provide legal services on a temporary basis in this jurisdiction that: (1) are undertaken in association with a lawyer who is admitted to practice in this jurisdiction and who actively participates in the matter; RPC 5.5 (c)(1). [Emphasis added.] The Court of Appeals stated that Mr. Van Idour “was working under the supervision of a Washington attorney named Neil Cox.” The 26 Answer to Disciplinary Board, No.19#00008, filed June 6, 2019. 16 record does not support a conclusion that Mr. Cox actively participated in the Ayerst matter. Mr. Van Idour’s pro hac vice claim is meritless. No pro hac vice order had been entered before the purported order in October 2017. The framing of the rule suggests that pro hac vice admission is per case, not per 100 cases. And it is clear that “temporary” in the rule cannot mean one year, purportedly representing more than 100 people. In effect, Mr. Van Idour was committing a crime the entire time he was attempting to represent Mr. Ayerst. This Court’s Precedent Requires Reversal E.The Court of Appeals admits that “because Mr. Ayerst's attorney was not licensed in Washington, he did not have ‘counsel’ as that term is defined for constitutional purposes. See City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wash.2d 212, 217, 667 P.2d 630 (1983).” Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d at 946. But the Court then veered into a review of cases citing Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 1983), involving out of state lawyers. Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d 943, 946. The Court wrote: “In the decades since Solina, courts have generally agreed structural error applies to representation by an unlicensed attorney only if the attorney has never been licensed in any jurisdiction.” Id., at 946. 17 The Court of Appeals misapprehended Ratliff’s holding. It ignored Justice Utter’s clear language that applies here: “Although one who is authorized to practice only under certain conditions, such as a legal intern, may be considered ‘counsel’ for constitutional purposes, this is so only when he or she complies with those conditions.” City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218. Mr. Van Idour did not comply with the conditions that might have allowed him to practice under any of the rules that the Court of Appeals speculated could have applied. And he did not comply with the conditions that apply to all appointed lawyers representing accused persons in Washington—satisfying the minimum requirements to practice law and certifying quarterly that he complies with certain standards. Mr. Ratliff was represented by a Rule 9 intern who was not allowed by the trial court to consult with his supervisor before trial. This Court emphasized that the supervising attorney “must supervise and assume professional responsibility for the legal intern's work. APR 9(D)(2).” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 216. Although the Court of Appeals suggested that Mr. Van Idour was supervised by a Washington attorney, there is no record of that, and the supervision requirement of someone seeking to practice under APR 8 was not met. This Court held: 18 Thus, in contrast to representation in accordance with governing rules, representation by a law student intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. If one substitutes “unlicensed out of state lawyer” for “law student intern” in that holding, it is clear that Mr. Van Idour’s failure to comply with Washington’s court rule on standards constitutes an absolute denial of the right to counsel. This finding requires reversal, without a showing of prejudice. In language that controls this case, this Court held: “Denial of representation by one actually authorized to practice in court constitutes a denial of counsel, not merely ineffective assistance.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 220. Mr. Ayerst was denied counsel and his conviction should be reversed. Conclusion. F.This Court has written: “the right to counsel is of paramount importance to all persons appearing in our courts and must be jealously guarded.” Ratliff, supra, 100 Wn.2d 212, 218. In keeping with that holding, Mr. Ayerst’s petition for review should be granted and his conviction should be reversed. 19 Respectfully submitted, __________________ Robert C.Boruchowitz WSBA #4563. 901 12th Avenue Seattle, Washington 98122 206 398-4151 20 V.Appendix From: McKenzie Campbell <MCampbell@co.as0tin.wa.uS> Date: June 18, 2021 at 11 :24:49 AM PDT To: "Story, Maddison" <mstory@seattleu.edu> Subject: RE: B.Vanldour Maddi, Yes that is correct.
