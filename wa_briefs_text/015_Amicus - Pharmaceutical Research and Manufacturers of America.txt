PhRMA members invested $91.1 billion in discovering and developing new medicines in 2020. PhRMA has an interest in predictable and fair liability standards for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The proposed exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine for direct-to-consumer advertising runs contrary to the Food and Drug Administration’s carefully constructed federal regulatory scheme. If adopted, that exception has broad, negative public-policy implications for patients and public health. II.INTRODUCTION Washington and every other state rely on the learned-intermediary doctrine to clearly define liability in failure-to-warn cases for prescription medicines. That doctrine does not alleviate a manufacturer’s duty of care. It instead defines how that duty is BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 1 PHA001-0014 6791953 satisfied. A manufacturer satisfies that duty by providing prescribers comprehensive risk information for prescription medicines. Equipped with comprehensive risk information, the prescriber can then assess the needs of each patient to determine whether a medicine is appropriate. In the 40-plus years since this Court adopted the doctrine, neither it nor the Legislature has entertained any exceptions to it. And for good reason. Prescribing physicians are already ethically obligated and legally responsible for warning patients about the risks of prescription medicines. They alone possess the medical expertise and the understanding of their patient’s medical profile necessary to make a personalized risk assessment. Nothing about advertising a prescription medicine changes the fact that patients cannot obtain it without a prescription from a learned intermediary. Petitioners now seek to use Washington’s process for answering certified questions from a federal court to upend this 43-year-old doctrine. On an anemic record, they ask this Court BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 2 PHA001-0014 6791953 to do what the Washington Legislature and courts across the nation have properly refused to do: create a direct-to-consumer marketing exception (DTC exception) to the learned-intermediary doctrine. This Court should join the growing consensus of courts and should reject a DTC exception to the doctrine. The proposed exception would expand liability in a way that conflicts with federal law and the law of all but one state. It would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide patients with different warnings about the potential risks of prescription medicines than required by FDA regulations. It would undermine the FDA’s scientific expertise and regulatory authority concerning the appropriate safety information and warnings for consumers. It would subject pharmaceutical manufacturers to one duty to warn in Washington and another in virtually every other jurisdiction. The expanded liability could harm public health by increasing the cost and decreasing the availability of innovative prescription medicines. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 3 PHA001-0014 6791953 III.ARGUMENT A.The learned-intermediary doctrine supports statutory and ethical duties to warn. 1. Washington and every other state follow the doctrine. The learned-intermediary doctrine is universally entrenched in the common law. Every state as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico holds that a manufacturer discharges its duty to warn when it informs physicians of the risks associated with a prescription drug. Resp’t Br. 3. When Washington adopted the doctrine over four decades ago, it was already a “well-established rule” nationally. Terhune v. A.H.Robins Co., 90 Wn.2d 9, 13, 577 P.2d 975 (1978); Marcus v. Specific Pharms., 77 N.Y.S.2d 508, 509–10 (N.Y.Gen. Term 1948) (first reported decision holding that a manufacturer meets its duty to warn by providing warnings to a prescribing physician). Since adopting the doctrine, this Court has consistently applied and recently re-affirmed it. See, e.g., Taylor v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 187 Wn.2d 743, 757–58, 389 P.3d 517 BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 4 PHA001-0014 6791953 (2017); McKee v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., 113 Wn.2d 701, 711, 720, 782 P.2d 1045 (1989); Sherman v. Pfizer, Inc., 8 Wn. App. 2d 686, 696, 440 P.3d 1016 (2019), rev. denied sub nom. Sherman v. Pliva, Inc., 194 Wn.2d 1015, 452 P.3d 1241 (2019). 2. The only state that rejected the doctrine recently enacted legislation embracing it. For a brief period, the highest court of West Virginia rendered the state the only one in the nation to reject the doctrine. Johnson & Johnson Corp. v. Karl, 647 S.E.2d 899, 914 (W.Va. 2007). No other state followed suit. Courts instead continued to embrace and expand the doctrine after that ruling.1 Less than a 1 These courts embraced the learned-intermediary doctrine after Karl: Rhode Island: Greaves v. Eli Lilly & Co., 503 F.App’x 70, 71–72 (2d Cir. 2012) (unpublished) (“[W]e conclude that the Rhode Island Supreme Court would likely adopt the learned intermediary doctrine . . . .”); South Dakota: Schilf v. Eli Lilly & Co., 687 F.3d 947, 949 (8th Cir. 2012) (applying the doctrine under South Dakota law); Nevada: Klasch v. Walgreen Co., 264 P.3d 1155, 1159 (Nev. 2011) (applying the doctrine to cover pharmacists for the first time); Wisconsin: In re Zimmer Nexgen Knee Implant Prods. Liab. Litig., 884 F.3d 746, 751–52 (7th Cir. 2018) (“[T]here is good reason to think that given the opportunity, the Wisconsin Supreme Court would join the vast majority of state supreme courts and adopt the learned-intermediary doctrine.”). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 5 PHA001-0014 6791953 decade after Karl, the West Virginia Legislature overturned the ruling by statute and adopted the doctrine. See W.VA.CODE § 55-7-30(2)(b) (2016). 3. The doctrine supports Washington statutory and ethical duties requiring doctors to warn their patients of the risks of prescription medicine. This Court has appropriately recognized the relationship between the learned-intermediary doctrine and a physician’s duty to obtain informed consent. When this Court first adopted the doctrine, it reasoned that because “the physician decides what facts should be told to the patient,” so long as manufacturers fully warn the physician, they “may reasonably assume that the physician will exercise the informed judgment” and, “in conjunction with [the doctor’s] own independent learning,” act in the patient’s best interest. Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 14. It connected the physicians’ discretion in deciding what information to give patients to the duty to obtain informed consent: “A physician has a duty to disclose . . . any grave risks of injury which may be incurred from a proposed course of BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 6 PHA001-0014 6791953 treatment, so that the patient, exercising ordinary care for his own welfare,” can “intelligently exercise his judgment by reasonably balancing the probable risks against the probable benefits.” Id. at 14 n.2 (citing ZeBarth v. Swedish Hosp. Med. Ctr., 81 Wn.2d 12, 499 P.2d 1 (1972) (adopting for the first time the doctrine of informed consent)). This Court’s reasoning in Terhune illustrates how the doctrine facilitates informed consent. The doctrine strengthens patients’ ability to comprehend the risks that prescription medicine poses by requiring manufacturers to provide doctors with comprehensive risk information, which they in turn distill for their patients on an individualized basis. The doctrine assumes what state law and medical ethics already require: physicians must use professional judgment both to assess the suitability of the medicine and to impart that information in a comprehensible manner to patients. The doctrine supports informed consent with the added benefit of clarifying potential liability for pharmaceutical manufacturers about the duty to BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 7 PHA001-0014 6791953 warn. Nothing about a prescription medicine’s being advertised to consumers changes physicians’ duty to exercise “informed judgment” in the patient’s best interest. Id. at 14. Because the learned intermediary’s duty remains intact regardless of whether a drug is advertised, so too should the doctrine. B.The Washington Products Liability Act embraces the doctrine without a DTC exception. The formation of the Washington Products Liability Act (WPLA) strongly suggests the Legislature’s approval of the learned-intermediary doctrine. In the forty years since the Legislature enacted the WPLA, the Legislature has left the doctrine intact without exceptions. Creating an exception now by judicial fiat would muddle the liability for manufacturers that the WPLA was enacted to clarify. 1. The WPLA set out to clarify the liability of product manufacturers. The Legislature enacted the WPLA to confront what it found to be a “product liability crisis” in Washington. S. 1st Sess. at 623, S.B. 3158 (1981). The Legislature intended the BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 8 PHA001-0014 6791953 WPLA to address this crisis by, among other things, reducing uncertainty for underwriters. Philip A.Talmadge, Washington’s Product Liability Act, 5 U.PUGET SOUND L.REV. 1, 6 (1981). To do so, the Legislature sought to establish “clear guidelines” for product-liability claims. Id. The Legislature identified the tort system as one of the “principal causes of the product liability problem.” S. 1st Sess. at 621, Interagency Task Force on Product Liability, S.B. 3158 (1981). By clarifying tort liability, the WPLA sought to stabilize the product-liability-insurance market and to keep the cost of coverage and goods affordable. See Talmadge, 5 U.PUGET SOUND L.REV. at 22 (explaining that the legislature “confronted the uncertainty and lack of predictability in the law, while preserving the right of injured consumers to obtain redress”); Laws of 1981, ch. 27, § 1 (seeking to solve the serious problem of “[s]harply rising premiums for product liability insurance,” which were “increas[ing] the cost of consumer and industrial goods”). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 9 PHA001-0014 6791953 2. After overhauling Washington product-liability law, the Legislature left the doctrine intact. The Legislature’s study of product liability for the WPLA spanned multiple legislative sessions. Talmadge, 5 U.PUGET SOUND L.REV. at 1–6. It solicited testimony from “every group which had indicated an interest in the subject” including “legal practitioners, business and insurance industry representatives, government regulators, court administrators, and academicians.” S. 1st Sess. at 620, Summary of Select Committee Objectives, S.B. 3158 (1981). The Legislature considered product-liability common law from Washington and sister states. See, e.g., S. 1st Sess. at 631, Analysis of Draft Bill, S.B. 3158 (1981) (discussing the implications of this Court’s ruling in Seattle-First Nat’l Bank v. Tabert, 86 Wn.2d 145, 542 P.2d 774 (1975), which applied a consumer-expectations test to determine liability for a product defect); S. 1st Sess. at 619–20, Summary of Select Committee Activities, S.B. 3158 (1981) (considering out-of-state common law). It also relied heavily on federal studies on product-liability BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 10 PHA001-0014 6791953 reform. S. 1st Sess. at 621, Select Committee Resource Material, S.B. 3158 (1981). The Legislature’s thorough study of product-liability common law preceding the WPLA indicates that it intentionally left the learned-intermediary doctrine intact. When it passed the WPLA, the doctrine had been in effect in Washington for three years and had already become a “well-established rule” nationally. Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 13. If the doctrine had done anything but facilitate the WPLA’s goals, the Legislature would have abrogated it, as it has done with other product-liability precedent. Wash. Water Power Co. v. Graybar Elec. Co., 112 Wn.2d 847, 855, 860 774 P.2d 1199 (1989) (concluding that the Legislature intended to abrogate common-law product-liability claims through the WPLA in favor of a single cause of action). In the WPLA’s preamble, for instance, the Legislature acknowledged its power to overturn judicial precedent: “Tort reform in this state has for the most part been accomplished in the courts on a case-by-case basis. . . . The legislature has from BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 11 PHA001-0014 6791953 time to time felt it necessary to intervene to bring about needed reforms. . . . Of particular concern is the area of tort law known as product liability law.” Laws of 1981, ch. 27, § 1; see also State v. Farnworth, 192 Wn.2d 468, 474, 430 P.3d 1127 (2018) (observing the Legislature’s “power to supersede, abrogate, or modify the common law by statute”). The Legislature has similarly spared the doctrine from amendments to the WPLA over the years. See, e.g., Laws of 1988, ch. 94, § 1 (codified at RCW 7.72.030); Laws of 1991, ch. 189, § 2 (codified at RCW 7.72.040). The Legislaure’s decision to leave the doctrine intact reveals that it does not consider any exceptions to the doctrine “needed reform.” 3. A DTC exception would undercut the WPLA’s goal in successfully keeping product liability predictable. Between the learned-intermediary doctrine and the WPLA, the liability for manufacturers of prescription medicine concerning their duty to warn has remained consistent in Washington for over forty years. If this Court created a DTC BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 12 PHA001-0014 6791953 exception to the doctrine, it would unravel the current predictability in tort liability for the duty to warn. The petitioners here have offered no clear parameters for how much liability such an exception could pose to manufacturers of prescription medicines. Unpredictable liability threatens the very instability in product prices and insurance premiums that precipitated the WPLA in the first place. C.Every state high court that has considered a DTC exception to the doctrine, except for New Jersey, has rejected it. Sister courts around the nation have uniformly rejected an exception to the doctrine for DTC advertising. See, e.g., DiBartolo v. Abbott Labs., 914 F.Supp. 2d 601, 613–16 (S.D.N.Y. 2012); Thomas v. Abbott Labs., No. CV-12-07005-MWF (CWx), 2014 WL 4197494, at *6 (C.D.Cal. July 29, 2014). The most recent state high courts to reject a DTC exception to the doctrine are Arizona and Texas. Watts v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 365 P.3d 944, 950–51 (Ariz. 2016); Centocor, Inc. v. Hamilton, 372 S.W.3d 140, 161 (Tex. 2012). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 13 PHA001-0014 6791953 The sole exception is New Jersey. Perez v. Wyeth Labs. Inc., 734 A.2d 1245 (N.J. 1999). But the New Jersey high court’s decision in Perez has been a pariah in and outside of New Jersey since its inception more than twenty years ago. No published decision in New Jersey or applying New Jersey law has ever applied its exception to hold a manufacturer of prescription medicine liable to a patient for a failure to warn. Courts have rejected a DTC exception to the doctrine primarily because patients cannot obtain prescription medicine without a learned intermediary’s prescription, regardless of whether the drug is advertised to consumers. “[A]lthough it may be true that DTC advertising encourages patients to ask specifically for the advertised drug, a physician who prescribed a drug to a patient simply based on the patient’s request, without an individualized medical assessment, would likely be liable for malpractice.” DiBartolo, 914 F.Supp. 2d at 616. The court in Centocor similarly relied on a physician’s ethical duties owed to a patient to reject a DTC exception to the doctrine. 372 S.W.3d BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 14 PHA001-0014 6791953 at 162 n.24. And as a federal district court recently recognized, exceptions to the doctrine “all involve situations where there is a lack of communication between patients and their physicians or where patients essentially control the selection of the product.” Hunte v. Abbot Labs. Inc., No. 3:20-CV-1626 (SRU), 2021 WL 5039130, at *8 (D.Conn. Oct. 29, 2021) (cleaned up).2 But DTC advertising does not implicate either scenario. Nor does it alter the learned intermediary’s professional role in prescribing a medicine based on a patient’s individualized risk profile. D.A DTC exception threatens the existing regulatory scheme, the efficacy of warnings, and the development of new medicines. 1. A DTC exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine would undermine federal and state regulation of prescription medicines. The proposed DTC exception to the doctrine would undermine the existing regulations surrounding prescription-2 The court in Hunte characterized the decision in Perez as an outlier: “the weight of authority seems to suggest that those courts that have adopted the DTC exception—particularly the New Jersey Supreme Court in Perez v. Wyeth Labs., Inc., 161 N.J. 1, 734 A.2d 1245 (1999)—are outliers.” Id. at *8. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 15 PHA001-0014 6791953 medicine advertising. There are at least three layers of oversight for responsible direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines at the federal level. First, the FDA regulates prescription-drug advertising. 21C.F.R. § 202.1 (regulating the content and format of prescription-drug advertising); 21 C.F.R. § 314.81(b)(3)(i) (requiring manufacturers to submit copies of all advertising for prescription medicines to the FDA at time of first use); see also 21 U.S.C. § 353c (allowing the FDA to require television advertisements to be submitted for approval before their broadcast).3 3 PhRMA’s Guiding Principles for DTC advertisements recognize that “Companies should submit all new DTC television advertisements to the FDA before releasing these advertisements for broadcast.” PhRMA, Guiding Principles: to Consumer Advertisements about Prescription Direct Medicines 5, 11 (Oct. 2018, revised Apr. 2019), available at https://www.phrma.org/cost-and-value/direct-to-consumer-advertising-principles. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 16 PHA001-0014 6791953 Second, for all prescription medicines, the FDA requires that labeling include comprehensive warnings. 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(c). Third, the FDA requires DTC broadcast advertising to include a major statement of the advertised medicine’s side effects and contraindications and to make “adequate provision” for the dissemination of the approved labeling of the advertised medicine. 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e)(1). The FDA also requires DTC print advertising to include a “brief summary” of the advertised medicine’s side effects and contraindications. Id. FDA regulations and guidance on DTC advertising help facilitate informed consent and physician–patient communication about prescription medicine. The FDA advises manufacturers to encourage patients to speak with their prescribing physician for a complete risk assessment and to warn them that the patient copy of warnings is not comprehensive. E.g., FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION, Brief Summary and Adequate Directions for Use: Disclosing Risk Information in BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 17 PHA001-0014 6791953 Consumer-Directed Print Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Prescription Drugs, Revised Draft Guidance, at 9 (Aug. 2015)4; see also PhRMA, supra note 3, at 12 (“DTC advertisements should motivate patients to ask their health care professionals for more information about a medicine’s risks and benefits.”). Physician-directed product labeling may also include advice on how to counsel patients about risks. 21 C.F.R. § 201.57(c)(18). At the state level, Washington prohibits patients from obtaining prescription medicines without a prescription from a licensed medical professional. E.g., chapter 18.71 RCW (regulating physicians and the right to practice medicine and surgery). Washington also requires prescribing physicians to obtain their patients’ informed consent, which requires adequate 4 Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/brief-summary-and-adequate-directions-use-disclosing-risk-information-consumer-directed-print (last visited Dec. 15, 2021). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 18 PHA001-0014 6791953 risk disclosure. Stewart-Graves v. Vaughn, 162 Wn.2d 115, 122, 170 P.3d 1151 (2007); RCW 7.70.050. In the context of an alleged failure to warn about the risks of an FDA-approved prescription medicine, these state and federal regulations work in harmony to provide clarity about the scope of a manufacturer’s potential liability. The learned-intermediary doctrine ensures that manufacturers can comply with the FDA’s well-established requirements without fear that doing so will leave them exposed to indeterminate liability from patients’ failure-to-warn claims. Without the assurance that manufacturers can discharge their duty to warn by providing comprehensive risk information to physicians, manufacturers would be conflicted about applying the FDA’s regulations and guidance to appropriately craft warnings and safety information in materials for patients. See PhRMA, supra note 3, at 11–12 (“Companies should work with the FDA in developing such consumer appropriate translation of relevant boxed warnings.”). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 19 PHA001-0014 6791953 2. A DTC exception would render warnings ineffective. If this Court created an exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine for prescription drugs that are marketed directly to patients, it risks triggering an onslaught of warnings directed at patients who lack the scientific training to make sense of them. The FDA has cautioned that “State law requirements can undermine safe and effective use in other ways. . . . [L]iability concerns . . . creat[e] pressure on manufacturers to expand labeling warnings to include speculative risks and, thus, to limit physician appreciation of potentially far more significant contraindications and side effects.” FDA Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Prescription Drugs, 71 Fed. Reg. 3922, 3935 (Jan. 24, 2006). In 2017, for instance, the FDA conducted an extensive study of the warnings in DTC advertising and concluded that “limiting the risks presented in DTC television ads and including a disclosure alerting consumers that not all risks are presented may be an effective strategy for communicating product risks.” FDA, Completed Research: BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 20 PHA001-0014 6791953 Disclosure Regarding Additional Risks in DTC Prescription Drug TV Ads (2017).5 Over-warning presents its own danger. On one hand, the flood of warnings may scare patients from heeding advice from prescribing physicians and the beneficial use of medicines. FDA Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs, 73 Fed. Reg. 2848, 2851 (Jan. 16, 2008) (observing that “[e]xaggeration of risk, or inclusion of speculative or hypothetical risks, could discourage appropriate use of a beneficial drug”). On the other hand, patients could become so inundated with warnings that they fail to take any of the warnings seriously. See FDA Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Prescription Drugs, 71 Fed. Reg. 3922, 3935 (observing that overinclusive warnings could “cause meaningful risk information to lose its significance”); see also 5 Available at https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/completed-research-projects-office-prescription-drug-promotion-opdp-research#disclosure (last visited Dec. 14, 2021). BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 21 PHA001-0014 6791953 Finn v. G.D.Searle & Co., 677 P.2d 1147, 1153 (Cal. 1984) (“[L]iability ought not to be imposed for failure to warn based on every piece of information in a manufacturer’s possession. . . . If we overuse warnings, we invite mass consumer disregard and ultimate contempt for the warning process.”). The United States Supreme Court has cautioned that “[m]eaningful disclosure does not mean more disclosure. Rather, it describes a balance between competing considerations of complete disclosure and the need to avoid informational overload.” Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 568, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed. 2d 22 (1980) (cleaned up). The FDA has already balanced competing considerations in outlining what information to give patients regarding risks of prescription medicine. A DTC exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine would upend this balance in Washington, spur over-warning to avoid unfair liability, and ultimately harm patients. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 22 PHA001-0014 6791953 3. A DTC exception would expose pharmaceutical companies to unfair liability that could chill innovation and increase drug prices. Without the predictability that the learned-intermediary doctrine has afforded manufacturers for nearly half a century, incentives to innovate would stall and the costs of medicine would likely spike. Cf. Brown v. Superior Court, 751 P.2d 470, 478–80 (Cal. 1988) (“The possibility that the cost of insurance and of defending against lawsuits will diminish the availability and increase the price of pharmaceuticals is far from theoretical.”) (collecting cases); see also Browning Ferris Indus. of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 282, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed. 2d 219 (1989) (O’Connor, J., concurring and dissenting) (“Some manufacturers of prescription drugs, for example, have decided that it is better to avoid uncertain liability than to introduce a new pill or vaccine into the market.”). Given the risks associated with expanding liability for manufacturers of medicine, courts are understandably cautious about creating exceptions to the learned-intermediary doctrine. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 23 PHA001-0014 6791953 The limited exception to the doctrine that some courts have adopted and noted in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Product Liability (1998) is instructive. The exception covers situations where medicines “are dispensed or administered to patients without the personal intervention or evaluation of a health care provider.” Id. § 6(d)(2); see also id. § 6 cmt. e. An example is mass-immunization clinics, where communication between medical professionals and patients about the risks associated with the vaccine are insufficient to warrant the protections of the learned-intermediary doctrine. See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCT LIABILITY § 6 cmt. e; Allison v. Merck & Co., Inc., 878 P.2d 948, 958 n.16 (Nev. 1994). But unlike mass immunizations, a patient cannot obtain a prescription medicine, such as Cialis, without a doctor both advising of the risks and writing a prescription. The bottom line is that a DTC exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine could raise the cost of and disincentivize manufacturers to develop innovative prescription medicines. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 24 PHA001-0014 6791953 See In re Norplant Contraceptives Prods. Liab. Litig., 165 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1999) (explaining that the doctrine seeks to encourage manufacturers to make prescription medicine available to the public). E.The record is too anemic to justify upending a four-decade-plus-old doctrine on a certified question. 1. This Court has declined to answer certified questions when the record does not justify upending settled precedent. This Court has discretion to answer questions federal courts certify. RAP 16.16(a); see also Alpert v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, 198 Wn.2d 228, 237, 494 P.3d 419 (2021) (declining to answer a certified question where doing so would risk “unnecessarily expand[ing]” reasoning in prior case). This Court “frequently limits certified questions, change[s] them, or simply declines to answer.” Yim v. City of Seattle, 194 Wn.2d 682, 705, 451 P.3d 694 (2019), as amended (Jan. 9, 2020) (Stephens, J., dissenting). And it declines to answer certified questions where the record is insufficient. Hoffman v. Regence Blue Shield, 140 Wn2d 121, 128, 991 P.2d 77 (2000), as BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 25 PHA001-0014 6791953 amended on denial of reconsideration (Mar. 24, 2000), and disapproved of on other grounds by Wash. Indep. Tel. Ass’n v. Wash. Utils. & Transp. Comm’n, 148 Wn.2d 887, 64 P.3d 606 (2003). This Court cautions that a decision without a complete record is “improvident” because it could “affect issues outside the questions certified and possibly bind entities who are not parties to this lawsuit, possibly in unanticipated ways.” Id. The record here does not support the unprecedented expansion of tort liability that the petitioners request. The petitioners’ case stalled at Eli Lilly’s still-pending motion to dismiss. The record is silent on several critical factual issues. For instance, there are no facts surrounding what Mr. Dearinger relied on in deciding to fill his prescription for Cialis or whether he read the warning label itself. See C.R., ECF No. 10 (First Am. Compl.). There are no facts revealing the content of the discussions between Mr. Dearinger and his physician about his use of Cialis. Nor are there facts clarifying whether his physician read the warning label about Cialis. Discovery in these areas BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 26 PHA001-0014 6791953 may well render the certified question wholly irrelevant But what is certain is that without any of this material information, this Court should not unseat forty-plus years of precedent in a factual vacuum, risking unanticipated consequences that could affect issues outside the question certified. See Hoffman, 140 Wn.2d at 128. 2. The petitioners have not pointed to any changed circumstances that would justify this Court’s gutting its own precedent. Contrary to the petitioners’ assertions, recent data shows DTC advertising works in tandem with the learned-intermediary doctrine to strengthen patients’ ability to engage with their healthcare provider and to ensure informed consent. A study from 2017 found that approximately one-third of respondents agreed prescription-medicine advertisements helped them have better discussions with their health care provider. Hellen W.Sullivan et al., Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising and Patient-Provider Interactions, 33 J.AM.BOARD FAM.MED. 161, 281 (Mar. 2020); FOOD AND DRUG BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 27 PHA001-0014 6791953 ADMINISTRATION (FDA), Patient and Physician Attitudes and Behaviors Associated with DTC Promotion of Prescription Drug – Summary of FDA Survey Research Results, at 85–88 (Nov. 19, 2004) (noting that DTC advertising increases patient awareness and encourages patients to consult their physicians, which can improve public health).6 Others reported that DTC advertising led them to talk with their provider about a new medical condition and to discuss their symptoms. Id; see also Elyse Krezmien et al., The Role of Direct-to Consumer Pharmaceutical Advertisements and Individual Differences in Getting People to Talk to Physicians, 16 J.HEALTH COMM. 831, 832 (2011) (explaining that “DTC pharmaceutical advertisements seem to be accomplishing their goal of getting people to talk to their doctors about targeted medications”); FDA, Behaviors associated with DTC, at 85–90 (noting that DTC advertising communicates the 6 Available at https://www.fda.gov/media/112016/download. BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 28 PHA001-0014 6791953 availability of treatments to the public and promotes increased awareness and patient–physician conversations). This Court will not overturn precedent unless there has been a clear showing that an established rule is incorrect and harmful or when the legal underpinnings of the precedent have changed or disappeared altogether. Deggs v. Asbestos Corp. Ltd., 186 Wn.2d 716, 729, 381 P.3d 32 (2016). Stare decisis has “added force” when the Legislature and the public have relied on a previous decision. Hilton v. S.C.Pub. Rys. Comm’n, 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed. 2d 560 (1991). Respect for precedent is strongest in statutory-construction cases because “the legislature is free to amend statutes to address interpretations it disagrees with.” Deggs, 186 Wn.2d at 730. The petitioners’ submission has not come close to “clearly showing” that the doctrine without a DTC exception is incorrect—let alone harmful. Nothing in the petitioners’ filings changes the fact that no patient in Washington can legally obtain BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 29 PHA001-0014 6791953 a prescription medicine without a medical professional first issuing a prescription. Petitioner’s demonization of DTC marketing is similarly unavailing. In a 2019 study, the FDA acknowledged that DTC benefits include “increasing disease awareness, and ultimately improving health outcomes by addressing underuse of potentially beneficial drugs.” Jessica DeFrank et al., Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs and the Patient-Prescriber Encounter: A Systematic Review, FDA, 35 HEALTH COMM. 739, 740 (2020). Studies also show DTC advertisements remind people to take their medication for health issues like depression and may lead to long term positive medication-taking behavior. Nilesh S.Bhutad & Brent L.Rollins, Disease-specific direct-to-consumer advertising for reminding consumers to take medication, 55(4) J.AM.PHARMACISTS ASS’N 434, 434–37 (2015). Far from inspiring doctors to abdicate their responsibilities, recent trends suggest providers’ willingness to BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 30 PHA001-0014 6791953 prescribe patient-requested drugs may have decreased over time. See Sullivan, 33 J.AM.BD.FAM.MED. at 282. The petitioners’ attempt to gut the learned-intermediary doctrine with a DTC exception disregards the reliance interests of both the Legislature and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Legislature has left the doctrine intact for over forty years despite massive overhauls of product-liability law in enacting and amending the WPLA.Because the Legislature is “free to amend statutes to address interpretations it disagrees with,” respect for the precedent that the WPLA does not impose any duty to warn beyond the FDA package inserts for physicians is particularly strong. Sherman, 8 Wn. App. 2d at 703. The record here does not give this Court occasion to disturb a doctrine that the manufacturers of prescription medicine have relied on in Washington for nearly half a century. Nothing in this sparse record justifies Washington breaking with the national consensus holding the learned-intermediary doctrine is BRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA IN SUPPORT OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY - 31 PHA001-0014 6791953 best administered without an exception for prescription medicine that is marketed directly to consumers. IV.CONCLUSION This Court should rejected reject a direct-to-consumer marketing exception to the learned-intermediary doctrine because (1) the doctrine strengthens the physician–patient relationship, (2) it facilitates informed consent, (3) a DTC exception would be at odds with the regulatory scheme for prescription medications, and (4) the factual record is insufficient to justify upending a doctrine that manufacturers have relied on for over four decades.
