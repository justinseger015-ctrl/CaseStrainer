The Initiative is part of the Fred T.Korematsu Center for Law and Equality at Seattle University School of Law, whose mission is to advance justice and equality through a unified vision that combines research, advocacy, and education. The first major projects of the Initiative included a report on misdemeanor practice in conjunction with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers entitled “Minor Crimes, Massive Waste”, and a project funded by the Foundation to Promote Open Society to increase access to counsel in misdemeanor courts in several states. For the past several years, the Initiative has worked with The Sixth Amendment Center on evaluations 1 of public defense in several states, including recent projects in Illinois and New Hampshire. This work was funded by a grant from the United States Department of Justice. The Defender Initiative has a deep interest in and significant experience in right to counsel issues. The Director of the Defender Initiative has worked on defender standards nationally and in Washington State for more than 30 years. He is an emeritus member of the Washington State Bar Council on Public Defense, for which he chairs the Standards Committee. He has written and spoken widely about the right to counsel and was Director of The Defender Association in Seattle for 28 years and President of the Washington Defender Association for 20 years before joining the faculty of the Seattle University School of Law in January 2007. He now is a Professor from Practice and has taught Criminal Procedure-Adjudicative, Right to Counsel, Law and Lawyering, and the Youth Advocacy Clinic. He led a committee that developed the American Council of Chief Defenders Statement on Caseloads and 2 Workloads in 2007. In 2003, he was a Soros Senior Fellow working on issues related to right to counsel in misdemeanor courts in Washington. He was amicus counsel in Mt. Vernon v. Weston, 68 Wn. App. 411(1992), the first published Washington appellate court opinion to refer to defender standards. The Director of The Defender Initiative has been an expert witness in systemic litigation concerning effective public defense representation in Washington, New York, and Louisiana. The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division found that he qualifies as an expert “on the operation of indigent defense systems and the evaluation of such systems in light of prevailing professional standards.” Hurrell-Harring v. State, 119 A.D.3d 1052, 1053, 990 N.Y.S.2d 286, 288 (N.Y.App. Div. 2014). The amicus incorporates by reference the full statement of interest in the Motion to File an Amicus Brief herein. 3 The Defender Initiative does not, in this brief or otherwise, represent the official views of Seattle University or its School of Law. The Washington Defender Association (“WDA”) is a statewide organization whose membership is comprised of public defender agencies, indigent defenders, and those who are committed to seeing improvements in indigent defense. WDA representatives frequently testify before the Washington House and Senate on proposed legislation affecting indigent clients and their families. The Washington Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court have granted WDA leave to file amicus briefs on many prior occasions. WDA represents 30 public defender agencies and has over 1,600 members. The integrity of public defense, including the qualifications of counsel and the Standards of Indigent Defense contained in CrR 3.1, is of central focus in this matter. This case is of great importance because of the grave implications it will have for 4 public defense, including what constitutes counsel under the law. II.INTRODUCTION Mr. Ayerst was convicted at a trial represented by a person who was not admitted to practice in Washington State. His “lawyer” Mr. Van Idour did not comply with CrR 3.1 Standards for Indigent Defense. This Court established the Standards to address the inconsistent provision of effective public defense services across the state. The Court of Appeals ignored the Standards and this Court’s history of addressing that issue. In addition, Mr. Van Idour likely was committing the misdemeanor of unlawful practice of law, which is a strict liability crime. That presented issues of conflict of interest. As he stipulated in his disciplinary proceeding, he was never authorized to practice law in Washington. 5 In effect, Mr. Ayerst did not “have ‘counsel’ as that term is defined for constitutional purposes.” Matter of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d 356, 486 P.3d 943, 946 (2021). As this Court explained in City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 220, 667 P.2d 630 (1983): “Denial of representation by one actually authorized to practice in court constitutes a denial of counsel.” This Court should reverse the conviction and make clear that lawyers engaged in providing public defense services must be qualified to practice law as required by the Standards for Indigent Defense. III.STATEMENT OF THE CASE Amici accept the Statement of the Case presented by the Petitioner. The key fact is that the lawyer appointed to represent Mr. Ayerst in his felony case was never admitted to the 6 Washington State Bar. This Court has now suspended him and enjoined him from applying to the Bar for 18 months.1 IV.ARGUMENT A.Summary Mr. Ayerst was convicted at a trial in which he was represented by a lawyer who was not admitted to the Washington Bar. Matter of Ayerst, supra. The Court of Appeals in this case completely ignored the Standards for Indigent Defense incorporated by this Court in CrR 3.1 Standards. While the Court cited Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed. 2d 674 (1984) it misapprehended the teaching of that case concerning prevailing professional norms and its application in Washington. This Court has adopted binding court rules regarding public defense. Prevailing professional norms in Washington require 1 In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, Supreme Court No. 202,021-6, Order Imposing 18-month Suspension, September 7, 2021. 7 compliance with Cr.R. 3.1 Standards. The unlicensed lawyer, Robert Van Idour, did not comply with the rule. The Court of Appeals ignored the teaching of State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 225 P.3d 956 (2010), and the history of standards adopted by this Court as explained in Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 297, 466 P.3d 231 (2020). Mr. Van Idour was never admitted to the Washington Bar. He therefore was not in compliance with Standard 14 that requires meeting the requirements for practicing law in Washington. Mr. Ayerst in effect was denied counsel. B.Mr. Ayerst’s “Lawyer” Did Not Comply with this Court’s Standards for Indigent Defense and Was Not Qualified to Represent Mr. Ayerst. As then Chief Justice Madsen wrote in 2012 about the adoption of the rules setting Standards for Indigent Defense: …we have learned that in areas of our state, the promise of access to effective assistance of counsel promised by our constitution has not been met and that we needed to take new measures to fully enact 8 the rights and protections due to those who enter the criminal justice system.2 The Chief Justice explained that “the Supreme Court in June adopted indigent defense standards to implement the public defender certification requirements of CrR 3.1, CrRLJ 3.1, JuCR 9.2.”3 In the preamble to CrR 3.1 Standards., the Court wrote: “The Washington Supreme Court adopts the following Standards to address certain basic elements of public defense practice related to the effective assistance of counsel.” Mr. Van Idour, assigned by the County to represent Mr. Ayerst, did not comply with the most basic requirements that this Court established—certifying that he had the minimum basic professional qualifications identified in Standard 14.1; access to an office, a postal address, and telephone service as included in Standard 5.2; appropriate use of investigation services as provided in Standard 6.1; and a caseload 2 Chief Justice Barbara Madsen, “Enacting standards for public defenders is a difficult but necessary balancing act,” Full Court Press, July 2012. 3 Id. 9 that allows for the time and effort necessary in each case to ensure effective representation as discussed in Standard 3.2.4 CrR 3.1 Standard 14.1 requires that the public defense counsel be admitted to practice law in Washington: Standard 14.1. In order to assure that indigent accused receive the effective assistance of counsel to which they are constitutionally entitled, attorneys providing defense services shall meet the following minimum professional qualifications: A.Satisfy the minimum requirements for practicing law the in Washington as determined by Washington Supreme Court; … 5 Mr. Van Idour only filed one certification of compliance with the court rules, and that was many months after he represented Mr. Ayerst, and he did not provide a Washington bar number on any of his filed papers, as he had none. [See Appendix for a copy of the Certification and an email from the Asotin County Clerk stating that he only filed one certification in 2017.] He therefore was not in compliance with the court 4 Id. 5 CrR 3.1 Standards. 10 rules that require “Certification of Compliance with Applicable Standards must be filed by an appointed attorney by separate written certification on a quarterly basis….” In his certification, he did not provide a bar number, he did not answer the first question about the percentage of his practice devoted to public defense, and he misrepresented that he met the basic professional qualifications in Standard 14.1.6 Mr. Van Idour stipulated in his disciplinary proceeding that he violated RPC 5.5 (a),7 which states: “(a) A lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.” 6 This Court issued the following order in Mr. Van Idour’s discipline case: “Respondent is enjoined from practicing law in Washington or from seeking admission to practice law in Washington in any form during the period of suspension.” In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, Supreme Court No. 202,021-6, Order Imposing 18-month Suspension, September 7, 2021. 7 In re Robert Jerry Van Idour, Disciplinary Board, Washington State Bar Association, Proceeding No. 19#00008, Stipulation to Suspension, at https://mywsba.org/webfiles/cusdocs/000009701210-0/059.pdf. available 2021, July 28, 11 He also stipulated that he violated RPC 5.5(b)8, which states: shall (b) A lawyer who is not admitted to practice in this jurisdiction not: (1) except as authorized by these Rules or other law, establish an office or other systematic and continuous presence in this jurisdiction for the practice of law; or (2) hold out to the public or otherwise represent that the lawyer is admitted to practice law in this jurisdiction. This Court has made clear that the Standards apply to any attorney providing public defense services. The Court discussed the Standards in Davison v. State: the court to any Our standards for indigent defense apply attorney appointed by to provide public defense representation. See generally CrRLJ 3.1 stds. Among other things, our standards require attorneys to certify to the courts that they comply with caseload limits, meet minimal case-level qualifications requirements, have access to an office, investigative services. Id. And these rules apply to all attorneys providing indigent public defense services whether county-based they employed in public defense offices, nonprofits, firms contracting with a city or county, or list attorneys appropriate and law use are 8 Id. 12 who represent indigent defendants. sometimes are appointed to Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 298–99, 466 P.3d 231, 238–39 (2020), as amended on denial of reconsideration (Oct. 20, 2020). This Court in A.N.J., supra, pointed out that “in some times and places, inadequate funding and troublesome limits on indigent counsel have made the promise of effective assistance of counsel more myth than fact, more illusion than substance.” State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 98. In this case, there was an illusion that Mr. Ayerst had qualified counsel. This Court responded to the well-documented problems in public defense in the state by adopting court rules that require certain standards to be met and certificates of compliance to be filed. Davison, 196 Wn.2d at 298–99. But these rules did not protect Mr. Ayerst because his unlicensed lawyer in this case did not comply with the standards or timely submit certificates of compliance. 13 In A.N.J., this Court relied as guidance on the Washington Defender Association’s Standards for Public Defense Services and the State Bar’s Standards for Indigent Defense Services. We note that state law now requires each county or city providing public defense to adopt such standards, guided by standards endorsed by the Washington State Bar Association. RCW 10.101.030; see also WASH.STATE BAR ASS'N, INDIGENT DEFENSE STANDARDS FOR SERVICESS (Sept. 20, 2007). While we do not adopt the WDA Standards for Public Defense Services, we hold they, and certainly the bar association's standards, may be considered with other evidence concerning the effective assistance of counsel. State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 110. Since A.N.J., this Court now has adopted Standards by court rules, so while the WDA and WSBA Standards remain useful in determining prevailing professional norms of practice, the court rules are binding. The prosecutor has misapprehended the importance of A.N.J. and failed to appreciate the impact of CrR 3.1 Standards, 14 which it failed to cite, in its Supplemental Brief, at 19, arguing that the Standards fail to establish minimum Sixth Amendment requirements. As this Court made clear in Davison, it has taken further action by court rule to remedy the deficiencies found in A.N.J. and other cases. While Mr. Van Idour was admitted in Idaho, he did not comply with Washington’s rules and Mr. Ayerst was deprived of a lawyer who met the Standards required to represent indigent clients. This Court has made clear that the bar admission process is not a meaningless formality. “The court’s ultimate responsibility in matters relating to admission of attorneys is to guard the public and its confidence in the judicial system.” Matter of Simmons, 190 Wn.2d 374, 387, 414 P.3d 1111 (2018). Mr. Ayerst’s lawyer was not admitted to the bar, he likely committed unlawful practice of law, and this Court’s aim 15 of protecting public defense clients by implementing the court rule on standards was thwarted. In addition, the Admission to Practice Rules’ (APR) purpose of protection was thwarted. APR 1 makes clear that a person shall be admitted to the practice of law only by order of this Court: (a) Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Washington has the exclusive responsibility and the inherent power to establish the qualifications for admission to practice law, and to admit and license persons to practice law in this state. ... While APR 3 allows for admission by motion for lawyers from other states who meet certain requirements, and APR 8 allows lawyers admitted in other states to appear in individual cases by motion and to represent public defense clients with certain conditions, Mr. Van Idour was not admitted under either of those rules. C.The Prosecutor Has Misapprehended the Import of S.M. for this Case. 16 The prosecutor has cited State v. S.M., 100 Wn. App. 401, 410, 996 P.2d 1111, 1117 (2000), for the proposition that “the Sixth amendment right to ‘counsel’ is satisfied when a defendant is represented by someone who is authorized to practice law rather than a lay person.” Respondent’s Supplemental Brief at 13. But the prosecutor omitted key language from the opinion: When a person holds himself out to the public as competent to exercise legal judgment, he implicitly represents that he has the technical competence to analyze legal problems and the requisite character qualifications to act in a representative capacity. When such representations are made by persons not adequately trained or regulated, the dangers to the public are manifest. Dauphin County Bar Ass'n v. Mazzacaro, 465 Pa. 545, 551, 351 A.2d 229, 232 (1976). Further, it [the legal procedure in which the legal assistant was the only one providing legal advice] deprived S.M. of substantive “counsel” as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. State v. S.M., 100 Wn. App. at 411, 996 P.2d 1111 (2000) (emphasis added). The court held that S.M.’s Sixth Amendment 17 right to counsel was violated and reversed the denial of his motion to withdraw his plea. Important for this case, Mr. Van Idour was not “authorized to practice law” and he was not adequately regulated, as he did not comply with the requirement that he be licensed and file certifications of compliance with the Standards. D.The Lack of Regulatory Review Resulted in Not Discovering Past Deficiencies in the Lawyer’s Public Defense Practice Without some regulatory review of a bar applicant, past indicators of problems are overlooked. In 2010, The National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) wrote a critical evaluation of public defense in Idaho, and highlighted Nez Perce County as an example of the problems.9 Mr. Van Idour’s in 9 NLADA, “The Guarantee of Counsel: Advocacy & Due Process Courts,” Idaho’s http://www.righttocounselproject.org/sites/default/files/id_guaranteeofcounseljseri01-2010_report.pdf, p.10. Amicus counsel for The Defender Initiative was part of the NLADA site team for that report. Trial 18 firm had the county’s public defense contract, both for direct representation and for overseeing the conflict lawyers. The report found “near unanimous agreement” among the county’s judges “that there is not a single thing about the public defense system in their county that they believe is worth replicating anywhere else.”10 In a paragraph that underscores the importance of the Washington Standards designed to protect defender clients, NLADA reported: The district and magistrate judges all with one voice expressed concern that public defense clients do not receive high quality representation. Their biggest complaint is they do not believe the public defenders meet with their clients in advance of appearing in court, but instead they believe these public defenders meet with their clients primarily only at the courthouse. Though most criminal justice system stakeholders agree Fitzgerald and Van Idour “have a wealth of experience,” the big complaint day-to-day of communication with their clients. 11 their lack is 10 Id. 11 Id, at 60. Mr. Van Idour is listed by Martindale as a member of the firm of Fitzgerald and Van Idour. See listing at 19 In that context, Mr. Ayerst’s letter to the trial judge May 28, 2017, provides additional support for holding that the failure to have a licensed Washington attorney requires reversal of the conviction. Asking that he be released or the charges against him be dismissed, Mr. Ayerst stated, “I wrote Mr. Van Idour for almost two week[sic] with no answer.”12 Division II of the Court of Appeals cited the Mazzacaro case in an earlier opinion for the proposition that when people holding themselves out as lawyers are not adequately “regulated, the dangers to the public are manifest....” State v. Hunt, 75 Wn. App. 795, 803, 880 P.2d 96, 100 (1994), citing Dauphin Cty. Bar Ass'n v. Mazzacaro, 465 Pa. 545, 551. Because Mr. Van Idour was not in any way regulated, the dangers to the public were not addressed. E.This Court’s Precedent Requires Reversal Because of Structural Error https://www.martindale.com/attorney/robert-jerry-van-idour-899047/ 12 This letter is provided in full in the Appendix. 20 The Court of Appeals admits that “because Mr. Ayerst's attorney was not licensed in Washington, he did not have ‘counsel’ as that term is defined for constitutional purposes. See City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 217, 667 P.2d 630 (1983).” Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d at 946. But the Court then veered into a review of cases citing Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 167 (2d Cir. 1983), involving out of state lawyers. Matter of Ayerst, 486 P.3d 943, 946. The Court wrote: “In the decades since Solina, courts have generally agreed structural error applies to representation by an unlicensed attorney only if the attorney has never been licensed in any jurisdiction.” Id., at 946. But the Court of Appeals misapprehended Ratliff’s holding. It ignored Justice Utter’s clear language that applies here: “Although one who is authorized to practice only under certain conditions, such as a legal intern, may be considered ‘counsel’ for constitutional purposes, this is so only when he or 21 she complies with those conditions.” City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218, 667 P.2d 630 (1983). Mr. Van Idour did not comply with the conditions that might have allowed him to practice under any of the rules that the Court of Appeals speculated could have applied. And he did not comply with the conditions that apply to all appointed lawyers representing accused persons in Washington—satisfying the minimum requirements to practice law and certifying quarterly that he complies with certain standards. Mr. Ratliff was represented by a Rule 9 intern who was not allowed by the trial court to consult with his supervisor before trial. This Court emphasized that the supervising attorney “must supervise and assume professional responsibility for the legal intern's work. APR 9(D)(2).” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 216. Although the Court of Appeals suggested that Mr. Van Idour was supervised by a Washington attorney, there is no record of that, and the supervision requirement of someone seeking to practice under APR 8 was not met. 22 This Court held: Thus, in contrast to representation in accordance with governing rules, representation by a law student intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219, 667 P.2d 630 (1983). If one substitutes “unlicensed out of state lawyer” for “law student intern” in that holding, it is clear that Mr. Van Idour’s failure to comply with Washington’s court rule on standards constitutes an absolute denial of the right to counsel. This finding requires reversal, without a showing of prejudice. In language that controls this case, this Court held: “Denial of representation by one actually authorized to practice in court constitutes a denial of counsel, not merely ineffective assistance.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 220. Mr. Ayerst was denied counsel and his conviction should be reversed. F.The Prosecutor’s Reliance on Flores is Misplaced. 23 The prosecutor relies on State v. Flores, 197 Wn. App. 1, 386 P.3d 298 (2016) for the proposition that a failure to comply with the Standards for Indigent Defense is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel and that the remedy for a violation of the Standards is a disciplinary proceeding. Respondent’s Supplemental Brief at 19. It then attributes that Court of Appeals’ opinion to this Court. Id., at 20. The Flores Court said that the record did not allow it to answer definitively the questions raised about the trial lawyer’s lack of qualifications. The Court wrote: “Whether it was error for Mr. Raheem to undertake the representation in this case is a question we cannot answer on this record….” State v. Flores, 197 Wn. App. 1, 11. The Court of Appeals emphasized that Ratliff involved a Rule 9 intern. “The intern did not attain the status of “counsel” in that circumstance and reversal was mandated without need to show prejudice.” Flores, 197 Wn. App. at 13. The attorney in Flores was an attorney, although he did not have the experience 24 required by the Standards. The Court found it unclear what role the firm for which he worked had in providing representation or supervision for the attorney. The record in Flores was murky and the Court of Appeals stated: “Since their role in this case is an unknown factor, we simply cannot say that the court erred by not requiring Mr. Raheem to certify his compliance with the SID upon appearing in the case.” Because this Court in A.N.J. and then in In re Gomez, 180 Wn.2d 337, 325 P.3d 142, (2014) found the Standards to be a guide to determine ineffective assistance of counsel, the Court of Appeals in Flores concluded that the adoption of the rule on Standards did not “redefine what constitutes counsel under the Sixth Amendment.” State v. Flores, 197 Wn. App. 1, 14. The Gomez Court wrote: “Prevailing professional standards may serve as guides for determining what is reasonable but may not serve as a checklist for evaluating attorney performance.4 Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688–89, 104 S.Ct. 2052.” In re Gomez, 180 Wn.2d 337, 351. The prosecutor 25 relies on footnote 4: “This court has previously concluded that “professional standards are evidence of what should be done, no more. State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 113, 225 P.3d 956 (2010).” The Gomez Court did not consider the Court Rule Standards because they were not in effect at the time of the trial. Gomez, fn. 3. But the question in Mr. Ayerst’s case before this Court is not the use of a checklist based on professional standards. The question is whether Mr. Ayerst was denied counsel because the person who represented him was not qualified to do so under the rules that this Court promulgated to protect public defense clients and under the Ratliff precedent. This Court does not need to rely on the Standards alone to find that Mr. Van Idour was not qualified. The Ratliff precedent is sufficient for that, as Mr. Van Idour was not authorized to practice law in Washington, and this Court has suspended for 18 months his ability to seek admission in 26 Washington. But it makes sense for this Court to consider the Standards in the rule it adopted. The Flores Court did not want to require a different standard for effective assistance for a court appointed counsel than for a retained one: we hold that violation of the SID is evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. It is not a categorical denial of counsel. To do anything else is to impose a higher standard of representation for indigent defendants than the Sixth Amendment counsel. requires retained for State v. Flores, 197 Wn. App. 1, 14, 386 P.3d 298, 305 (2016) But this Court adopted CrR 3.1 Standards. to protect clients who are not able to choose retained counsel. As Chief Justice Gonzalez wrote in concurrence in Davison: The State has known for a long time that delegating primary responsibility for public defense to local governments has often led to the systematic deprivation of effective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F.Supp. 2d (W.D.Wash. 2013); A.N.J., 168 Wash.2d at 99, 225 P.3d 956. 1124-26, 1122, 1133 27 Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 304, Gonzalez, J., concurring. Justice Gonzalez recounted a history of documentation of problems in public defense, and added: In the wake of the Grant County case, A.N.J., and other similar cases, this court adopted caseload limitations on public defenders. Standards for Indigent Defense …. Nonetheless, some localities still systemically failed to provide adequate indigent public defense. Wilbur, 989 F.Supp. 2d at 1124-26, 1133. Id. at 305. V.CONCLUSION The question before this Court is not redefining the constitutional meaning of counsel. The constitutional principle is that when a person is not authorized and not qualified to represent a client, the client has been denied counsel. That is structural error requiring reversal without a showing of prejudice. The Court Rule on Standards helps this Court to determine whether the “lawyer” who was assigned to represent 28 Mr. Ayerst was qualified, and under that rule, he clearly was not, because he was not admitted to practice in Washington. The conviction should be reversed.
