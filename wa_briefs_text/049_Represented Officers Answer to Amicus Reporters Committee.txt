And even though OPA made those findings public to the full extent necessitated by SMC 3.28.830, Amici Curie Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (“Reporters Committee”) seeks to make the redacted information in the OPA Closed Case Summary (“OPA Summary”) public, particularly the identities of the Four Represented Officers. The problem with the Reporters Committee’s argument is that it simply proclaims that the identities of any public servant caught up in any administrative investigation should be readily available to the public regardless of circumstances. But as this Court has repeatedly observed, the disclosure mandates of the Public Records Act (“PRA”) require a careful analysis of the circumstances underlying the investigation, including whether -1- the alleged misconduct occurred during the course of public service, and, importantly, whether the alleged wrongdoing is ultimately substantiated or not. Without so much as even alluding to the precedent recognizing the significance of whether the alleged misconduct is ultimately substantiated, the Reporters Committee seeks to bundle the innocent subject’s identity with the public’s interest in participating in and evaluating the substance of police oversight. Oddly, Reporters Committee claims that public disclosure of the identities of the cleared officers is necessary to evaluate the administrative response, when the only possible governmental response to an unsubstantiated allegation is no response. Bellevue John Does 1-11 v. Bellevue Sch. Dist. #405, 164 Wn.2d 199, 220, 189 P.3d 139, 150 (2008) (“…if the misconduct didn’t occur, the only actual governmental action is the investigation”). And even if no response to an unsubstantiated finding legitimately invites public scrutiny, as this Court has already seen, the substantive aspects of the OPA -2- investigation, including OPA’s reasoned recommendations, have been disclosed with redaction of the Officers’ identities only. Thus, the media is well equipped by this disclosure to freely report on any issue of legitimate concern to the public pertaining to OPA’s response to the events of January 6, 2021. Because the exempted disclosure of the identity of an innocent subject does not undermine public confidence and involvement in the process for curtailing police misconduct, the identity of a person caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations is not “of legitimate concern to the public.” Secondarily, the Reporters Committee, without delving anywhere close to controlling case law, effectively echoes Mr. Sueoka’s claims that public participation in a political rally somehow does not implicate free speech protections. As noted in the Represented Officers’ September 30, 2021 supplemental brief, the anonymous exercise of free speech, even if undertaken in public, is not tantamount to a waiver of those rights. See 9/30/21 Rep. Officers’ Supp Br. at pp. 9; 17. Aside from this -3- passing reference, the Reporters Committee’s substantive arguments appear solely focused on the “legitimate concern to the public” element of RCW 42.56.050. Therefore, the Represented Officers address only that argument in this answer. II.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Represented Officers hereby reincorporate the facts contained in their Supplemental Brief filed on September 30, 2021, pp. 2-5. III.DISCLOSURE OF THE IDENTITIES OF THE FOUR REPRESENTED OFFICERS CLEARED OF ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE INSURRECTION IS NOT OF LEGITIMATE CONCERN TO THE PUBLIC The specific identities of public employees caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations are not of legitimate concern to the public. Although the “nature of the allegations and reports related to the investigation and its outcome” may very well be of legitimate public concern, the specific identities of the subjects having committed no wrongdoing are not. The Reporters Committee purports to -4- “write to emphasize the substantial public interest served” on the ability to report on “government agencies’ efforts to address police officer misconduct.” See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p. 7. Such emphasis is unnecessary given this Court already found that, in the case of unsubstantiated allegations, the “public can continue to access documents concerning the nature of the allegations and reports related to the investigation and its outcome, all of which will allow concerned citizens to oversee the effectiveness of the [government’s] responses.” Bellevue John Does, 164 Wn.2d at 221, 189 P.3d at 150. Such emphasis is also unnecessary where, as here, the now-disclosed OPA Summary details the nature of the investigation at issue, including methodology, resulting factual determinations, and the reasoning substantiating the ultimate conclusions. Thus, even without the Represented Officers’ names, the public, indeed, can access information demonstrating whether “police oversight boards are effectively evaluating and responding to repeated misconduct complaints.” See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. -5- Comm. at p. 8. The entirety of that process is readily discernable from the disclosed OPA Summary. Despite the fact that both Bainbridge Island Police Guild v. City of Puyallup, 172 Wn.2d 398, 259 P.3d 190 (2011) and Bellevue John Does specifically distinguish between the public concern over disclosure of the nature of an unsubstantiated investigation, and the subject of an unsubstantiated investigation, the Reporters Committee blurs those two concepts together. However, these concepts are not similar in any respect and are far from deserving of the same analysis. Unlike the need for transparency in an internal investigation to foster public trust in police accountability, the identity of an officer in an unsubstantiated investigation does nothing to contribute to transparency and/or public confidence in the police accountability review process. This is particularly true where, as here, the allegations lodged against the police officer are ultimately unfounded. In Bellevue John Does, for example, this Court emphasized that “whether information is of legitimate -6- concern to the public is whether the information is true or false.” Bellevue John Does, 164 Wn.2d at 217, 189 P.3d at 148 (2008) (citing with approval City of Tacoma v. Tacoma News, Inc., 65 Wn. App. 140, 147, 827 P.2d 1094, 1098 (1992)). And, even where allegations are merely “unsubstantiated” versus “patently false,” the same public concern over the identities of the subject Officers is lacking. See id. at 218. “In essence, disclosure of the identities of [public employees] who are the subject of unsubstantiated allegations ‘serve[s] no interest other than gossip and sensation’.” Id. at 221. “The identity of the accused ... is unnecessary, and plays little role in the public’s oversight of the investigation.” Id. at 220 (emphasis original). “The name is most relevant to public oversight if the misconduct occurred—if the misconduct didn’t occur, the only actual governmental action is the investigation.” Id. (citation omitted) (emphasis original). In short, the identities of police officers do not aid the public in overseeing the government’s response to unsubstantiated allegations. Nor does their disclosure facilitate the investigative -7- process since the investigation has already concluded by the time a finding is rendered. The Reporters Committee outright ignores the thrust of this reasoning articulated in Bellevue John Does. Instead, to sidestep that decision, it simply points out that this case does not involve police officers accused of sexual misconduct, and somehow because of the lack of an unfounded sexual misconduct allegation, the names of the Represented Officers “[are] a matter of legitimate public concern.” See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p. 9. With respect, such an argument is too facile, and wholly at odds with the reasoning in established case law. First, this Court’s assessment of the nature of the unsubstantiated allegation in Bainbridge Island Police Guild and Bellevue John Does appears squarely limited to whether its disclosure is “highly offensive” and, even if unsubstantiated, is likely to subject the public employee to “hatred and ridicule.” Id. at 215; see also Bainbridge Island Police Guild, 172 Wn.2d at 415, 259 P.3d at 198. In other words, the nature of the allegation, if -8- unsubstantiated, has no bearing on the legitimacy of the concern to the public. Secondly, even if the nature of the allegation factored into the “legitimate concern to the public” prong of RCW 42.56.050, intuitively, a more severe allegation – such as sexual misconduct – would presumably be of even greater public concern. But this intuition cuts against limiting the application of the holding of Bellevue Johns Does and Bainbridge Island Police Guild to less severe unsubstantiated alleged misconduct because, if the legitimacy of public concern varied directly with the severity of the alleged misconduct – in those less severe cases, the public interest would also be less significant. On the other hand, the more severe the allegation, the more likely its severe nature would expose the subject of the investigation to hatred or ridicule, thus pitting the “highly offensive” prong directly at odds with the “legitimate public concern prong” of RCW 42.56.050. Because the fulfillment of both conditions are necessary to establish a privacy interest, if a court were to weigh the severity -9- of the allegation in assessing the legitimate concern to the public, rare, if ever, would be the case of an unsubstantiated allegation exempt from disclosure. See Fraternal Order of Eagles, Tenino Aerie No. 564 v. Grand Aerie of Fraternal Order of Eagles, 148 Wn.2d 224, 239, 59 P.3d 655, 663 (2002) (courts should construe a statute to avoid an absurd result). In other words, for the privacy exemption to apply according to this reasoning, disclosure of the allegation would need to be severe enough to be highly offensive, but not so severe as to warrant public interest. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the appellate decisions cited by the Reporters Committee do not assess the nature of the unsubstantiated allegation in analyzing whether disclosure of subject identities are of legitimate concern to the public. Although in City of Fife v. Hicks, 186 Wn. App. 122, 345 P.3d 1 (2015), Division II alluded to Bainbridge Island Police Guild’s usage of the phrase “unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct” in characterizing the prior holding in Bellevue John Does, it did so only to reject a bright-line rule that the identity of -10- officers involved with unsubstantiated allegations are categorically exempt from disclosure. Id. at 141. In analyzing whether the unsubstantiated allegation at issue was of legitimate concern to the public, the Court noted the legitimacy of the concern stemmed from the fact that the investigation “concerned the official conduct of high-ranking police officials.” Id. at 143. It also noted that the “investigation in fact confirmed that many of the events described had actually occurred.” See id. Not so here. These were rank and file officers in a wholly off duty capacity. Moreover, there was no evidence linking any of them to the insurrection, and, in three cases, indisputable evidence corroborated their departure from the Capital before those events unfolded. Likewise, Division II’s reasoning in West v. Port of Olympia, 183 Wn. App. 306, 333 P.3d 488 (2014), also cited by the Reporters Committee, did not assess the nature of the allegation in analyzing the legitimate public concern prong. Far from it, the Panel in West declined to address that issue altogether -11- because it found that disclosure of allegations pertaining to accounting irregularities and office policy violations were not highly offensive to a reasonable person. Id. at 333, fn. 3 (“Because we hold that disclosure of the employee’s name and identifying information would not be highly offensive, we need not address whether the information is of legitimate public concern”). Thus, contrary to the Reporters Committee’s brief, these decisions do not in any way hold that a legitimate public interest somehow arises in “other types of alleged wrongdoing” found to be unsubstantiated. See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p. 9. Indeed, no case does. Much less, does any authority analyze the legitimate public concern element in terms of the severity of the unsubstantiated alleged misconduct. In a half-hearted attempt to justify public disclosure of the names of the Represented Officers who were cleared of any involvement in the insurrection, the Reporters Committee argues that “without access to the names of officers investigated for potential misconduct…the public cannot evaluate whether police -12- oversight boards are effectively addressing repeated misconduct…”. See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p. 16 (emphasis added). The problem with this argument is that potential misconduct is inherently unsubstantiated, and therefore, not misconduct at all. Rather, it is nothing more than a mere unsubstantiated accusation. At best, the number of accusations demonstrates the number of times an officer has been investigated. And the frequency of investigations can be easily explained by extraneous factors such as the nature of the police officers’ assignment. See, e.g., Rob Arthur, Bad Chicago Cops Spread Their Misconduct Like a Disease, The Intercept (August 16, 2018), http://perma.cc./3SQU-524T (“On its own, such a pattern [of complaints] could simply mean that these particular officers are more likely to be street cops or assigned to high-crime divisions”). The number of complaints says nothing about whether misconduct has occurred. And this absence is even more pronounced when the officer is cleared of misconduct. As with the improper usage of propensity evidence per ER 404(a), -13- unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct are of no evidentiary value. See State v. Foxhoven, 161 Wn.2d 168, 175, 163 P.3d 786, 789 (2007) (“Before admitting ER 404(b) evidence, a trial court must (1) find by a preponderance of the evidence that the misconduct occurred…”)(internal quotations omitted). By analogy, unsubstantiated claims of misconduct should also be of no legitimate value to the public, especially when used to scrutinize an individual public employee cleared of any misconduct. To be sure, the same cannot be said with substantiated allegations of misconduct following a comprehensive administrative investigation. Indeed, the articles relied upon by the Reporters Committee overwhelmingly observe trends in, and instances of, governmental responses to substantiated misconduct. For example, the Buzz Feed Article discussed in the Reporters Committee’s Brief references a finding “of least 319 NYPD employees who had committed offenses serious enough to merit firing but who were allowed to keep their jobs.” See -14- Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p. 16. The other examples in the Article primarily, if not exclusively, concern the inadequacy of the response to substantiated misconduct, such as use of verbal reprimands for illegal searches, and the failure to fire officers for lying under oath or falsifying records. Id. Likewise, the source material for the Washington instances based on PRA requests involved instances of substantiated misconduct. Id. at pp. 20-21. So, too, did the media’s reporting of the mockery of Elijah McClain’s death by Aurora Police Officers. Although not criminal, this mockery amounted to a substantiated violation of Aurora Police Department policy for conduct unbecoming. See id. at p. 24. Notably, in Derek Chauvin’s case, he was repeatedly reprimanded for substantiated misconduct prior to murdering George Floyd on a public street. See Shaila Dewan & Serge F.Kovaleski, Thousands of Complaints Do Little to Change Police Ways, N.Y.Times (updated June 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/XS5L-F2HJ. -15- None of these examples supply the Court with any basis for disclosure of the identities of police found to have not committed misconduct. In virtually all instances, any legitimate public concern centered on the appropriate response to substantiated misconduct. Thus, unlike an unsubstantiated allegation where the “only actual governmental action is the investigation,” Bellevue John Does, 164 Wn.2d at 220, 189 P.3d at 150, concern over public input to, or assessment of, governmental action based on past substantiated misconduct is apparent. Not so, where the government has no role – and indeed – no ability, to take action against a public employee cleared of wrongdoing after an administrative investigation. Therefore, any legitimate public concern in the identities of the Represented Officers’ is absent. And the public certainly does not have a legitimate concern in “monitoring specific officers” based on unsubstantiated allegations. See Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p.16. Rather, it has a legitimate concern in monitoring the process designed to verify those allegations. -16- Nor is the compelled disclosure of a cleared officer’s identity following a comprehensive investigation needed to identify “troubling trends.” Id. at p. 16. Trends are deciphered from statistics, not the specific identities of individuals. If members of the Seattle community believe the data on frequency of complaints (even those that are unsubstantiated) will afford the policymakers at the OPA with essential tools to improve the police accountability process, the identities of the individual officers cleared of misconduct are not implicated by culling anonymous data. Nor does attributing the number of complaints to specific officers require linking the identity of officers to particular instances of unsubstantiated misconduct. It should be the data that matters in identifying trends, not the identity of the officers caught up in an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations. To be sure, the importance of transparency and public involvement in police oversight are laudable goals. Indeed, these objectives are fully embraced by the Seattle Municipal Code -17- provisions enabling OPA, which, even in furtherance of these very goals, requires redaction of officer names when allegations of misconduct are not sustained. See SMC 3.28.830. Although the powers exercised by police do create the need for public oversight, including a review of a police department’s completed internal investigations, that goal is not in any way undercut by disclosure of the substance of the investigation following its conclusion. The identities of the specific officers are unnecessary to evaluate whether their conduct “was subjected to a thorough investigation,” see Amicus Curiae Br. of Rptrs. Comm. at p.16; the outside observer can evaluate the thoroughness of the investigation by reviewing the actual investigation. On the basis of that transparent investigation summary, the media is free to report on matters of legitimate concern to the public, and the public is free to partake in reforming police accountability based on what it learns from those reportings. -18- IV.CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Represented Officers respectfully request that this Court reverse the trial court’s order denying their request for a preliminary injunction, and remand with instructions to the trial court to enjoin production of the Represented Officers names or identities.
