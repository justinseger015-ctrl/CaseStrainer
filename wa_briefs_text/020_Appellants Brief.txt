Wash. Const. Art. I§§ 3~ and 34. In State ex rel. Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Brooks, 80 Wn.2d 121, 492 P.2d 536 (1972), it was observed that our constitution establishes a very broad right of the electorate to recall elective public officials. The challenge in that case was to the sufficiency of charges set forth in a recall petition. The rules which guide the courts in examining the sufficiency of such charges, which are set forth there, exemplify the principle that the judiciary must exercise restraint in interfering with the elective process which is reserved to the people in the State Constitution. 2 Cases in which it was held that an election will not be set aside for a mere informality or irregularity which cannot be said in any manner to have affected the result of the P-lection also illustrate that principle. Among them are State ex rel. Dore v. Superior Court, 171 Wash. 423, 18 P.2d 51 (1933) (holding an election notice sufficient even though it contained an inaccurate description of the office to be filled); School Dist. 81 v. Taxpayers, 37 Wn.2d 669,225 P.2d 1063 (1950) (holding that election notice requirements are not mandatory); Vickers v. Schultz, 195 Wash. 651, 81 P.2d 808 (1938) (holding that the failure to post notice of an election, as required by statute, would not vitiate the election where it was shown that the purpose of the notice was served by the wide publicity given the election); *76 Seymour v. Tacoma, 6 Wash. 427, 33 P. 1059 (1893) (holding that an election would not be defeated by such irregularities as posting notice 26 days rather than the 30 days required by statute); Rands v. Clarke County, 79 Wash. 152, 139 3 P. 1090 ( 1914) (holding that failure to post notice did not render an election invalid and citing a number of cases which had previously held that notice requirements are directory rather than mandatory, unless the legislature has specifically provided that failure to post notice will invalidate the election); and Murphy v. Spokane, 64 Wash. 681, 117 P. 476 (1911) (holding that an election was not invalidated by the failure of the election officers to observe or comply with the statutory requirements that a certain number of election officers be selected and qualified in a specified manner, that they be present at all times, that they take an oath of office, or that the polls be opened on time and kept open during the time prescribed by law). [McCormick v. Okanogan County, 90 Wn.2d 71 (1978) 578 P.2d 1303.] The recall process as it was originally intended when passed by constitutional amendment, was to be broad. From the time this court first decided a case dealing with the recall 4 right promulgated in Wash. Const. Art. 1, §§ 33 and 34 (amend. 8),[1] to as recently as last year, [2] we have always interpreted the recall provision broadly so as to allow the people to exercise their right of self-governance. [Fred J Dore - Chandler v. Otto, 103 Wn.2d 268 (1984)]. Elected officials in Washington may be recalled by the voters if they have "committed some act or acts of malfeasance or misfeasance while in office" or violated an "oath of office." Wash. Const. Art. I,§§ 2, 33. To protect public officials "from petitions based on frivolous or unsubstantiated charges[,] ... the courts serve a gateway function in the recall process," evaluating whether a recall petition states facts which, if true, constitute a recallable offense. In re Recall of Kast, 144 Wn.2d 807,813 (2001). [In the matter of the Recall of Sawant, No. 99948-1, 2021.] [In re Recall of Kast, 144 Wn.2d 807, 813 (2001).] 5 The courts do not decide whether the facts alleged in the petition are true, or whether a particular offense is sufficiently egregious to justify recall, because "the right of recall is guaranteed to the citizens of this State, and it is for the people to decide if [some wrongful act] is of sufficient severity to warrant a recall election." In re Recall of Pearsall-Stipek, 141 Wn.2d 756, 770 (2000). Governor Jay Inslee, via his council at the Attorney General's office, has asserted that our charges do not have legal or factual sufficiency. Which is to say that they have asserted that our charges are "frivolous or unsubstantiated charges", which is clearly false. The Superior Court erred in their decision. We will argue and show that they are sufficient and substantiated, enough to allow the voters of the state of Washington to decide. 6 C Davis is a registered voter, residing in Olympia, Thurston County of the State of Washington. II.BACKGROUND Petitioners exercised their constitutional rights by filing a Statement of Charges against Governor Jay Inslee. The Statement of Charges recited five acts of malfeasance, misfeasance, or violation of the Governor Inslee's oath of office. The Superior Court for Thurston County held a hearing to determine the factual and legal sufficiency of those charges, before which the parties submitted additional briefing and factual materials. As is consistent with Washington State procedures ( although NOT codified in the RCW), the Attorney General's office represents the Governor in a recall demand, however, the 7 Attorney General's office also represents the proponents/petitioners in the recall demand. In this case the judge in the trial court, was Judge Carol Murphy, a 17-year employee of the Attorney General's office and potentially a conflict of interest. By appearance alone, Judge Murphy should have recused herself from the case. Judge Murphy in making her decision erred in the scope of her interpretation of sufficiency. "The court here must make two determinations: First, the sufficiency of the charges, that is, whether the acts stated in the charges offered in support of the recall satisfy the criteria for which a recall petition may be filed; and second, whether the ballot synopsis prepared by the Attorney Geueral is adequate." Judge Murphy should have recognized that the criteria of sufficiency was NOT frivolous and not unsubstantiated". 8 Where there is evidence presented of malfeasance, misfeasance or a violation of oath of office, it becomes the purview of the voters to make the final decision. Judge Murphy further erred in her statement that our case did not show INTENT to act unlawfully. Knowingly [ or should have known] undertaking an unlawful act, is in fact INTENT to act unlawfully. Other errors in the Judge Murphy's decision will be address specifically by charge. III.ARGUMENT Washington's recall process safeguards against voters with a grudge harassing elected officials for making a decision the voter did not like, or for minor, innocuous mistakes. See, e.g., Pearsall-Stipek, 141 Wn.2d at 767. "Courts act as a gateway to ensure that charges are factually and legally sufficient before they are placed before the 9 voters." Matter of Recall of Boldt, 187 Wn.2d 542, 548 (2017). "A petition is factually sufficient when the charges, taken as a whole, identify to the electors and to the official being recalled acts or failure to act which without justification would constitute prima facie showing of misfeasance, malfeasance, or a violation of the oath of office." In re Recall of Pepper, 189 Wn.2d 546, 555 (2017) (internal citations omitted), a petition is legally sufficient if it "state[ s] with specificity substantial conduct clearly amounting to misfeasance, malfeasance or violation of the oath of office." See Chandler v. Otto, 103 Wn.2d 268, 274 (1984). When there is evidence that an elected official violated the law or his/her oath of office, voters have the constitutional right to interpret that evidence, decide its import, and determine whether it justifies the official's removal. Wash. Const. Art. I,§ 33. Voters may also "draw reasonable inferences from the facts; the fact that conclusions have been drawn by the 10 petitioner is not fatal to the sufficiency of the allegations." See Boldt, 187 Wn.2d at 549 (quoting In re Recall of West, 155 Wn.2d 659,665 (2005) (citing Chandler v. Otto, 103 Wn.2d 268, 274 (1984))). "Role of the courts in the recall process is highly limited." See Kast, 144 Wn.2d at 813. The Superior Court incorrectly found the charges against Governor Jay lnslee were legally and factually insufficient and failed approved a ballot synopsis. The Governor should make his arguments to the voters directly. RCW 29A.56.140; See Pepper, 189 Wn.2d at 554 ("It is the voters, not the courts, who will ultimately act as the fact finders"). At no point in our argument have we commented on the existence of Covid-19, nor have we commented on the impact of this virus. We have also NOT weighed in on any of the 11 treatments ( or vaccines). These topics are not a matter of law, but simply a matter of medical consideration. We only argue that Governor Inslee committed lawless acts, knowingly and as such with intent. We choose not to address whether a crime once committed has a benefit or a negative outcome. A.The recall charges are as follows: Charge #1. On or about March 23, 2020, Governor Inslee issued Proclamation 20-25, "Stay Home - Stay Healthy." The Stay Home - Stay Healthy order prohibited all people in Washington State from participating in social, spiritual and recreational gatherings of any kind regardless of the number of participants. Violations of Proclamation 20-25 were punishable as crimes pursuant to RCW 43.06.220(5). Proclamation 20-25 violated Article I, § 11 of the Washington State Constitution, "Religious Freedom." 12 Charge #2. On or about March 18, 2020, Governor Inslee issued Proclamation 20-19, "Evictions." The Evictions order prohibited residential landlords from initiating judicial action seeking a writ of restitution involving a dwelling unit if the alleged basis for the writ is the failure of the tenant or tenants to timely pay rent. Violations of Proclamation 20-19 were punishable as crimes pursuant to RCW 43.J6.220(5). Proclamation 20-19 violated Article IV, § 1 of the Washington State Constitution, "Judicial Power, Where Vested." Charge #3. Governor Inslee exceeded statutory authority granted in RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending the Open Public Meetings Act, infringing on the people of Washington's right to petition the government for redress and infringing on the people's rights to peaceably assemble under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, thereby violating RCW 43.06.220(2)(g). Such a violation ofRCW 43.06.220(2)(g) constitutes misfeasance, a violation of the 13 Governor's oath of office, or both; either result subjects the Governor to recall. Charge #4. Governor Inslee exceeded statutory authority granted in RCW 43 .06.220(2)(g) by st:.spending people's rights to peaceably assemble by limiting the number of people allowed to attend a single gathering under Proclamations 20-05, 20-06, 20-07, 20-11, and subsequent Proclamations. Such a violation results in a valid claim for misfeasance, a violation of the Governor's oath of office, or both; either result subjects the Governor to recall. Charge #5. On February 29, 2020, and beyond, the Governor issued all of the Covid-19 pandemic Proclamations without just cause as he failed to make a finding that a public disorder, disaster, energy emergency, or riot existed in the State of Washington due to Covid-19. Such a finding is a condition precedent to declaring a state of emergency and is required by RCW 43.06.010(12). The Governor's illegal Covid-19 14 Proclamations result in a valid claim for misfeasance, a violation of the Governor's oath of office, or both; either result subjects the Governor to recall. Charge #1: Violation of Religious Liberty We do not challenge the decision on Charge # 1 and do NOT ask for review on this charge. Charge #2: Violation of Separation of Powers and the Independence of the Judiciary. Governor Jay Inslee violated separation ox' powers, held by case law, when he prohibited landlords from exercising their fundamental right to FILE an unlawful detainer with the court, for redress of wrongs arising from a tenants' failure to pay rent. a. The Charge (#2) is Factually and Legally Sufficient The very essence of civil liberty consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws through the 15 courts, whenever he/she receives an injury. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803); Putman v. Wenatchee Valley Med. Cent., P.S., 166 Wn.2d 974, 979 (2009). The Governor, through Proclamation 20-05 and 20-19, stripped a class of Washington residents of the fundamental, constitutionally protected right to access courts. The Governor seemingly argues that he suspended a "substantive right," not a "procedural" one. This misinterpretation of the law is flat out wrong on an issue that has been clear since Waples v. Yi, 169 Wn.2d 152 (2013) (Striking down a pre-suit notice imposed by the legislature on pre-suit notice for medical malpractice claims). The judicial power of the state is vested in the Supreme Court and superior courts both with an independent constitutional authority. Wash. Const. Art. IV, §§ 1, 2, and 6. The Supreme Court has the inherent right to determine its court 16 rules, including how Washington courts are accessed. See Waples, 169 Wn.2d at 159-160. The legislative branch, with one limited exception, cannot modify how courts are accessed unless allowed to do this via a court rule. As noted by Governor Inslee, CR 81 allows for legislative modifying of "special proceedings", but even that modification is made by a court rule. The Supreme Court, not the legislature nor the executive branches of the Washington state government, defines how Washington citizens access our courts. In violation of this fundamental right, Governor Inslee has clearly stated that landlords are forbidden from serving process on unlawful detainer actions. Governor Inslee's basis for this position is that it would be oppressive for tenants to have to appear in court: WHEREAS, under RCW 59.12 (Unlawful Detainer), RCW 59.18 (Residential Landlord-17 Tenant Act), and RCW 59.20 (Manufactured/Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Act) residents seeking to avoid default judgment in eviction hearings need to appear in court in order to avoid losing substantial rights to assert defenses or access legal and economic assistance. RCW59 Governor Inslee is clearly attempting to interfere with a statutory requirement to appear in court and answer to a landlord's plea for justice and enforcement of a property right, which he will achieve by interfering with the right to serve process, a procedural function and right of the courts, not one the executive branch. The Governor claims benevolence through "returning" rights to landlords who are selling their property, or landlords whose tenant are creating a significant risk to life, safety, or property. However, the Governor's "benevolence" occurs through his modification of a procedural rule that fits squarely in the judicial branch's arena by creating a pre-filing procedural 18 requirement that a landlord submit a declaration that a transaction is based on harm to health or property. Without the required declaration, the transaction cannot advance. This procedural requirement is akin to the procedural hurdle struck down in Putman, Id. The Governor clearly provides no testing of this declaration for its authenticity or standard by which it is measured for truth (preponderance, clear and convincing, etc.); therefore, it must be a procedural change to the law. Even assuming the RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) gives the Governor the power to create legislation, it does not give him the right to limit access to courts. Our Supreme Court has been clear: procedural court rules are part of the access to justice; those procedural rules are the courts' alone. By prohibiting a group of Washington citizens from access to courts, Governor Inslee has violated his oath of office, and acted with misfeasance. 19 "Character of actor's intention. In order that an act may be done with the intention of bringing about a harmful or offensive contact or an apprehension thereof to a particular person, either the other or a third person, the act must be dc,ne for the purpose of causing the contact or apprehension or with knowledge on the part of the actor that such contact or apprehension is substantially certain to be produced." See Garratt v. Dailey, 46 Wn.2d 197 (1955) 279 P.2d 1091. Certainly, by prohibiting a landlord from filing an unlawful detainer, 1) any reasonable person would foresee a harmful outcome, both to the independence of the court as well as to the landlord, 2) an attorney licensed in the state of Washington would know (or should have known), that violating separation of powers would cause harm to the independence of the court as well as to the financial harm to the landlord. While Governor Inslee asserts that his action was to relieve tenant's anxiety, which it termed as oppression, it is not 20 lawful nor reasonable to disestablish separation of powers and HARM the landlord to that end. When the trial court questioned Governor Inslee's council as to whether the restrictions were a violation of rights: "THE COURT: I understand that. But doesn't it restrict the rights of property owners in their remedy that they are requesting?" The reply from Governor Inslee's council was: "MR.COPSEY: Yes, it does. It temporarily restricts it. But, again, there is no constitutional right to that particular remedy. You know, they are not being denied a constitutional access -- or pardon me -- it's not a violation of separation of powers because it is not in conflict with any procedural rule of the court. It is simply imposing a delay on when that action can be filed." In this reply Inslee's council is arguing for a specific remedy, rather than the RIGHT to petition the court for ANY remedy. 21 The court queried Inslee's council regarding the open ended nature of the restriction of the prohibition of the right to redress. "THE COURT: Well, it delays the right to enforce their rights under the contract or even be heard by a court for over -- well over a year; isn't that right?" "MR.COPSEY: Well, in effect, it's turned out to be over a year because the proclamation has been updated over time, and other -- you know, other -- how do I say - some of the restrictions have been lessened over time in order to better accommodate landlords. Right. There is still an eviction moratorium in place." Again, the reply first skirts the separation of powers argument; and second shows manifest indifference toward the landlord's loss of rights with regards to redressing harm. This is a direct representation of knowledge of harm and as such INTENT to commit unlawful acts. Furthermore: 22 "MR.COPSEY: ... And at that time, I forget the exact date, it seems to me like it was in place for a specified period of time. My memory is 30 days, but, again, it's been renewed since then. So that may be less significant." Governor Jay Inslee's council shows a blatant disregard for the length that the unlawful hardship is to be sustained by these landlords. Additionally, Governor Inslee's council states: "MR.COPSEY: ... But in that sense, Your Honor, it's really no different than a land use moratorium, where there are restrictions ... " Here Mr. Copsey clearly makes no distinction between land use / zoning and the right of the courts to make their own rules. Mr. Copsey's statement also fails to recognize that land use it normally applied PRIOR to development rather than to a preexisting project, or even to a preexisting contract. Hence bears no relevancy to the redress of wrongs. 23 "THE COURT: And so the concept of justice delayed is justice denied doesn't apply in this context, Mr. Copsey?" "MR.COPSEY: That concept, it may -- justice may be delayed. I would question whether it's denied. But I would say that the way this moratorium was issued is not a violation of the separation of powers." Notice that Council for Governor Inslee first tries to shift focus to cast this as a land use issue. When that loses traction, he falls back on to separation of powers, and fails in both arguments. In fact, JUSTICE is delayed by violating the doctrine of separation of powers, and rather than even a "delay", this continues to this day. When an INJUSTICE continues without a foreseeable end, it is essentially permanent. Judge Carol Murphy ERRED when she entered the following decision: "The Governor had information, some of which is in this record, that justified the temporary restrictions. We all recognize that the restrictions continued multiple times beyond what was expected to be temporary." And 24 "Although certain unlawful detainer actions and not all are restricted, the charges here have not shown a violation of separation of powers, the commission of an unlawful or unconstitutional act or an intent to violate the law or the constitution." In these statements Judge Murphy mistakenly seems to think that it is within her purview to determine "guilt" or "innocence" or "justification" or not, rather than simply to determine whether there is sufficiency. In fact, by the exchange between Judge Murphy and Mr. Copsey, there is clearly sufficiency to allow the voters to make this determination. b. Governor Showed Intent. Let the voters decide. Governor Jay Inslee KNEW or should have known that his actions were lawless. Knowing this while proceeding, shows his intent to commit this lawless act. State v. Williams, 148 P.3d 993 (2006). 25 When Governor Inslee issued emergency proclamation 20-19: "Residential landlords are prohibited from initiating judicial action seeking a writ of restitution involving a dwelling unit if the alleged basis for the writ is the failure of the tenant or tenants to timely pay rent. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, an action under Chapters 59.12 or RCW 59.18 RCW." He made it clear that he was prohibiting "judicial action seeking a writ of restitution", this shows specific intent to violate a landlord's rights by violating the independence of the judiciary. Furthermore, when the governor proclaimed: "Local law enforcement is prohibited from serving or otherwise acting on eviction orders that are issued solely for default payment of rent related to such property." He was additionally changing rules of service, which though not required to show violation of separation of powers, does show that he did additionally change court rules. 26 The governor states in the premise of Proclamation 20-19 states: "WHEREAS, under RCW 59.12 (Unlawful Detainer) and RCW 59.18 (Residential Landlord Tenant Act) tenants seeking to avoid default judgment in eviction hearings need to appear in court in order to avoid losing substantial rights to assert defenses or access legal and economic d " assistance; an ... . This further shows that he did intend to cause hardship to landlords as a reason for violating the independence of the judiciary. This also makes the curious argument that by not appearing in court "substantial rights will be lost", yet others who had needs to access the courts were prevented from in person appearing in court. So, some citizens were affected differently than others with regards to their rights to access the courts. 27 Governor Inslee acted unlawfully and with INTENT when he violated separation of powers. The court must let the voters decide this action. Charge #3: Governor Inslee exceeded statutory authority granted in RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending the Open Public Meetings Act. a. The Charge (#3) is Factually and Legally Sufficient While RCW 43.06.220 gives a governor the power to waive laws, there are fundamental principles of being an American that are beyond what is permissible in a free and open society. Judge Murphy erred when she stated: "The court concludes that the First Amendment and rights under the First Amendment are very different than the Open Public Meetings Act. And even under RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), the Open Public Meetings Act does not create constitutional rights. There is no 28 constitutional right to attend all meetings covered by the Open Public Meetings Act in person." The Open Public Meetings Act (OPMA) is a statutory right of citizens in the state of Washington, it was never claimed to be a constitutional right. But, a citizen's full access to open government is a fundamental part of American History and tradition, without which we cannot claim to be a free and open society. The issue here is that the Governor Inslee violated RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) by suspending regulatory obligations under the OPMA, as prescribed in RCW 42.30. More specifically, the Governor's suspension of the OPMA violated the People's delegation of authority to public servants under the OPMA that mandates that the People "insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created." RCW 42.30.010. 29 Proponents noted in the Charges the lack of broadband internet throughout the State and noted that for impacted individuals, the pandemic created a situation wherein those individuals did not have the same access to their government in a pre-pandemic world. Proponents offer a Declaration or Mr. Justin Carey, who is one of those affected indivi'1uals. (See Carey Declaration, attached as Exhibit A.) Mr. Carey attempted several times to attend or speak at his local city council meetings and was denied access; twice he was denied access due to not wearing a facial covering-a violation of his deeply held religious beliefs; and at least twice he was unable to access the meeting due to technological difficulties. Clearly, Mr. Carey's experience demonstrates "a conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment. .. of the people to peaceably assemble" and to seek redress from his government. RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii) (emphasis added.) 30 At issue is does waving the OPMA restrict access to open government. In Governor Inslee's Council's defense of the waiver, he states: "And then third, the proclamation does not limit other means of communication. It encourages the use of online tools and electronic media to communicate with agencies." By restricting access to only "online tools and electronic media" there is created an elite who will have access to government, and a sub-class who will NOT have access to government. Online tools and electronic media require hardware that is beyond the means of many ofV/ashington's citizens, including marginalized minorities, people on limited incomes and people who lived in regions that lack adequate broadband service. The purpose of the OPMA is to permit the public to observe all steps in the making of government decisions. 31 Meetings of the university's law school faculty are subject to the OPMA, despite the power of the board of regents to ultimately overrule the law school faculty's decisions. The OPMA entitles the public to be present at all stages of the decision-making process. See Cathcart v. Andersen, 85 Wn.2d 102 (1975) A governing body can hold a public Meeting by Telephone or Video Conferencing only complies with the OPMA when the follow conditions are met: AGO 2017 No. 4 -A governing body can hold a public meeting by telephone or video conferencing so long as the speaker phone or video is: (1) provided at the designated meeting place, at the designated meeting time; and (2) attending members of the public can hear all discussion, provide testimony, and otherwise be aware of the governing body's steps in taking its official action. 32 RCW 42.30.030 establishes the core OPMA requirements: "All meetings of the governing body of a public agency shall be open and public and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the governing body of a public agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter." A "meeting" in the context of the OPMA means a gathering of a majority of the governing body "to discuss or act on matters in which [the attendees] have a common interest." Citizens All. for Prop. Rights Legal Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d 428, 443, 359 P.3d 753 (2015) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1131 (10th ed. 2014)). For a "meeting" to occur within the meaning of the OPMA, "action" must be taken by a quorum of the governing body. RCW 42.30.020( 4); Citizens All. for Prop. Rights Legal Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d at 442-43. The term "action" is broadly defined in the Act as "the transaction of the official business of [the] public agency by [its] governing body 33 including ... receipt of public testimony, deliberations, discussions, considerations, reviews, evaluations, and final actions." RCW 42.30.020(3). "Thus, within the context of the OPMA ... a 'meeting' of a governing body occurs when a majority of its members gathers with the collective intent of transacting the governing body's business[.]" Citizens All. for Prop. Rights Legal Fund v. San Juan County, 184 Wn.2d at 444. However, the mere passive receipt of electronic communication by a member of the governing body does not constitute participation in a meeting by that member. Id. Open participation in public meetings is considered so important that, RCW 42.30.060 provides that actions taken by a governing body are "null and void" unless the meeting is open to the public and proper notice has been given. A further point with regards to the OPMA is that by RCW 43.30.040 attendance at a public meeting prohibits the 34 governing body from requiring attendees "to register his or her name [or] other information, to complete a questionnaire, or otherwise to fulfill any condition precedent to his or her attendance." Electronic meeting attendance would require "registering one's name, IP address and other information." b. Intent For Governor Inslee to waive the OPMA without incurring intent to do a manifest wrong, at the very least, he would have to have provided UNIVERSAL access for Washington citizens, to teleconferencing software, hardware AND a secure room to use this in. Open and transparent government is fundamental and necessary to ensure a free society, and while the OPMA is not a constitutional right per se, it is the foundation of many constitutional rights. RCW 42.30.010 states it's intent: 35 "The legislature finds and declares that all public commissions, boards, councils, committees, subcommittees, departments, divisions, offices, and all other public agencies of this state and subdivisions thereof exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of this chapter that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created." The language is strong, enough so as to suggest that denial of access to government meetings is a loss of personal sovereignty to government. RCW 42.30.070 allows in case of emergencies, to change the location of the affected meeting. 36 Generally emergencies are classified as fire, flood, earthquake, or other emergency, though by the litany test there is no inference that pandemic is among these reasons. Even if an emergency forces the change of a meeting location, the public still has the right to attend. In waving the OPMA, at the least restricting access to public meetings, the Governor KNOWLINGLY prevented transparency to the actions of government and KNOWLINGLY prevented citizens, and an overwhelmingly certain classes of citizens (rural residents, lower income, the disal:led and minorities), their access to government. Charge #4: RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii) Sufficient a. The Charge is Factually and Legally On April 6, 2020, Rebecca Faust, a resident of Thurston County submitted an application for a permit to the Department of Enterprise Services (DES), of the State of Washington. To 37 hold a rally, called "Rally for Rights", to advocate for freedom and disability rights. The rally was to be held on May 1, 2020. The DES informed Ms. Faust that due to Governor Inslee's emergency proclamation her permit for a rally, which is freedom of assemble and protected by RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), was denied. Ms. Faust appealed this decision, as it is cer right to appeal an administrative decision, to Chris Liu, Director of DES via email, and also sent the email via "cc" to Governor Jay Inslee and Kathryn Leathers (one of Governor Inslee's aids). Chris Liu's reply to Ms. Faust was that due to Governor Inslee's "Stay Home Stay safe" Proclamation that public rallies ( even political) were banned. Governor Inslee's proclamation threatened criminal punishment for the exercise of both free speech and freedom of assembly. RCW 43.06.220(5). Further noted is that the event was planned for the 38 Capitol Campus, which is outside, and for which there is no SCIENCE that shows any health risk to outdoor gatherings. The revisions of the emergency statute had the intent to specifically limit the scope of these powers. WLile the bill SB 5260 recognizes that the Governor has broad authority to wave or suspend statuary obligation, Section (2)(g)(iii) protects the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and assembly. This charge is substantial and not frivolous. It is a clear assault on very specific emergency powers. b. Intent Knowingly undertaking an unlawful act is general intent. When Governor Inslee made the proclamation, and the underlying direction to Department of Enterprise Services to prevent the issuance of permits for public (political) assembly, Governor Inslee knowingly violated RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(III). On May 21, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law SB 5260, which added the language: 39 "(g) Such other statutory and regulatory ooligations or limitations prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency if strict compliance with the provision of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, unless (i) authority to waive or suspend a specific statutory or regulatory obligation or limitation has been expressly granted to another statewide elected official, (ii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, or (iii) the waiver or suspension would conflict with the rights, under the First Amendment, of freedom of speech or of the people to peaceably assemble. The governor shall give as much notice as practical to legislative leadership and impacted local governments when issuing orders under this subsection (2)(g)." 40 While the right to free speech and the right to freedom of assembly are codified in the Bill of Rights and as such are constitutional principles, our charges do not focus on the fundamental constitutional aspect, but rather the statutory aspect. By knowingly violating a state statute, which he signed into law, the Governor at the very least demonstrated general intent to act lawlessly. Furthermore, with the evidence introduced in the Faust affidavit it indicates that the Governor's acts were even specifically directed to limit assembly of people with disabilities. It can further be noted that while the Governor's actions restricted freedom of assembly to conservative groups he did not take actions against Marxist groups such as AntiFA and BLM, who we free to commit violence in Seattle, Olympia and elsewhere, including on the Capitol Campus. 41 By knowingly violating the state statute RCW 43.06.220(2)(g)(iii), Governor Inslee committed an unlawful act with general intent. It is not the purview of the court to decide innocence or guilt, only to recognize that this charge is NOT frivolous and is substantial. It is for the voters to decide the outcome. Charge #5: Violation RCW 43.06.220(2)(g) a. The Charge (#5) is Factually and Legally Sufficient April 25, 1969, the Washington State Legislature passed Senate Bill SB 392 (as referenced in the original argument for Charge #5). The final version of the bill allowed the governor to declare a state of emergency for the following 3 reasons: public disorder, disaster or riot. At issue in Charge #5 is does the governor have a statuary permission to issue a declaration of emergency for a medical pandemic. 42 Prior to the final version of the original bill, the reasons for an emergency declaration were far more limited, and focused entirely on civil unrest and criminal acts of violence and property damage. Senate Bill SB 392: Section (12): ( (He may control or suppress riots or unlw.vful strikes, or any unlawful assembly of ten or more persons, 1,,vhen by such riot, unlw.:vful strike, or unlaw:ful assembly any persons are attempting to commit a felony, or inciting others to commit such crime, or any person or persons are in imminent danger of losing either life or property. Before taking any such action, the governor shall first notify and request the local authorities to suppress such riot, unlawful strike, or unlmvful assembly, and if they fail, refuse, neglect, or are unable to do so, he shall issue his proclamation commanding relation to acts and duties to be performed by others towards him, extends to the person performing for the time being the duties of governor)) He may, after finding that public disorder, disaster or riot exists within this state or any part thereof which affects life, health, property or the public peace, proclaim a state of emergency in the area affected and the powers granted him during a state of emergency shall be effective only within the area described in the proclamation. 43 Understanding the backdrop of the times gives greater insight into the thinking of the legislature and what their intent was regarding the declaration of emergency powers. On July 28, 1967, President Lyndon B.Johnson organized the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders to investigate the urban rebellions erupting in cities across the nation, between 1964 and 1967. The findings of the seven-month study were published in March of 1968, ( a year before passage of Washington State's Emergency Powers Statute.) Martin Luther King Jr., an African-American clergyman and civil rights leader, was fatally shot at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Prior to this Memphis Sanitation workers staged a walkout, on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions. Recall that the original Washington emergency statute allowed for an emergency declaration for an unlawful strike action. 44 On July 29, 1968, seven Seattle policemen and two civilians are wounded by gunfire and rocks during a Central Area riot prompted by a police raid on the Seattle office of the Black Panther Party. "On March 26, 1968, Senator Robert F.Kennedy (1925-1968) (D-NY), meets enthusiastic crowds in Seattle as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. Speaking to more than 10,000 people at the University of Washington ... On March 31, 1968, President Johnson announced to the nation that he would not seek nor would he accept his party's nomination for president. On June 4, 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy was shot by an assassin in Los Angeles ... " The 1960s were without a doubt very violent times, plagued by civil unrest ( or public disorder and riot.) There is little doubt that the Washington state legislature was focused on 45 these issues with regards to setting the reasons for declaring emergency powers. But a further question remains, that being the idea of medical emergency. Could the legislature have simply "forgotten" to consider medical emergency? Had it been so long since there was a medical emergency in the United States that it was not relevant? NO! In fact, September 1968 was the start of the H3N2 pandemic (or Hong Kong Flu). The pandemic was caused by an influenza A (H3N2) virus comprised of two genes from an avian influenza A virus, including a new H3 hemagglutinin, but also contained the N2 neuraminidase from the 1957 H2N2 virus. The estimated number of deaths was one million (1,000,000) worldwide and about one hundred thousand (100,000) in the United States. Most deaths were in people aged 65 years and older. In Washington state, the peak effect of the virus was December 14, 1968. So, the effect of the H3N2 virus was very much in the forefront of current events when 46 SB 392 was being debated, yet there is no mention of medical emergency in the bill as a reason for a state of emergency. The statute for declaring an emergency was updated again in the 1970s to add, "energy emergency" to the list of reasons for declaring an emergency, and still no addition of "medical emergency". As Justice Antonin Scalia said, "[a law] says what it says and doesn't say what it doesn't say". When determining the meaning of what a disaster is, we must use "history and tradition". Since 1968 there have been eight governors, and until Governor Inslee, not one of them felt that a disaster could be interpreted as a medical pandemic. Not during the Hong Kong Flu A of 1969, nor the Russian Flu of 1977, nor any other of the pandemics that have occurred over the years. In fact, every other governor UNDERSTOOD that a disaster meant NATURAL disaster. They also understood that declaring a state of emergency was an extreme act that had to be exercised with caution. This is evidenced by the relatively 47 few emergency declarations over the years. Every disaster until Governor Inslee was due to floods, fires, a volcano eruption or extreme weather. What follows is a list of governors since 1970, the number of emergencies that they declared, and the reason. In every case it was a disaster, a natural disaster. Dan Evans, 1965-1977, 1 emergency order, Disaster/flooding. Dixie Lee Ray, 1977-1981, 1 emergency order, Disaster/volcano. John Spellman, 1981-1985, 0 Emergency orders. Booth Gardner, 1985-1993, 0 Emergency orders. Mike Lowry, 1993-1997, 0 Emergency orders. Gary Locke, 1997- 2005, 1 Emergency order, Disaster/Flooding. Christine Gregoire, 2005- 2013, 2 Emergency orders, Disaster/Flooding. 48 Both legal and factual sufficiency is overwhelming. The court's responsibility is limited. It is not the privilege of the court to make a determination as to guilt or innocence, only to be the gatekeeper, to prevent frivolous charges. This charge is far from frivolous and is robust with substantial reasoning. With so much to consider it is right for the people to evaluate all of the evidence and make their own decision. b. Intent: The voters Should Decide the Validity of Governor's Exercise of Emergency Power for a Medical Situation, themselves. Governor Inslee contends (in the trial court), that the: " ... the legislature confirmed its intent to provide broad authority to the governor to proclaim a state of emergency under Chapter 46 RCW prior to the pandemic, and it ratified the proclamations that the governor issued in the exercise of his emergency authority during the pandemic after the fact." 49 But this is in error for two reasons. First, the history and tradition of the legislature has not defined emergency powers broadly, they have in fact made the reasons for emergency declarations rather narrow, with only for reasons specified, stated above, and none of such reasons include medical situations. Second, a recall is a vehicle of the people, not specifically of the legislature. Even though the legislature failed to end the Governor's state of emergency, that is not reason to prevent a recall from proceeding. This is a factual dispute over the meaning of what reasons the Governor may declare a state of emergency, which must be decided by the voters. Governor Inslee's brief in Section F cites the case, Cougar, 97 Wn.2d at 474, in which Governor Dixie Lee Ray declared a state of emergency, a NATURAL DISASTER, in regards to a potential eruption of Mt. St. Helens. In the Cougar 50 case it was the timing of the declaration that was in despite. The question was did Governor Ray have the authority to declare an emergency for a natural disaster BEFORE the eruption or only after. The court held that a governor had broad power as to WHEN to declare an emergency, but made no comment what reasons were acceptable for such a declaration. As stated above we assert that a NATURAL DISASTER is a valid reason for an emergency declaration, the Cougar case affirms our belief that, "disaster" means "natural disaster". Further stated in the Cougar case, "In times of natural catastrophe or civil disorder, immediate and decisive action by some component of state government is essential." It is clarified that disaster means "natural Catastrophe". In our recall, the notion of legislative police powers does not relate, as we contend that there was no authority to declare an emergency in the first place. 51 IV.CONCLUSION In 1913 the citizens of Washington passed a constitutional amendment that became Article I, §§ 33-34, of the Washington State Constitution, giving the citizens a broad right of recall, for all elected offices [ except judges]. This recall process allowed 25% of the voters within any jurisdiction to place on the ballot a demand for recall of a public official within that jurisdiction. Over the years the courts took on the roll as a gateway to insure minimal legal and factual sufficiency of the recall petitions and to protect public officials from harassment thought frivolous and unsubstantiated charges. The court has a limited roll and it is left for the voters to make the decision based on the evidence. This day and time when many of our public institutional are losing the faith of the electorate, it is even more important to respect the constitutional rights of the voters. Confidence in our executive, legislative and judicial process is at an all-time 52 low. It is now, more than ever, vital to allow the voters to decide, where it is the constitutional prerogative to do so. Petitioners C Davis, et al, respectfully requests this court to recognize the sufficiency of the charges. The court should order the Superior Court to approve a Ballot Synopsis for Charges #2 thru #5 and permit these matters to proceed expeditiously to the voters as provided under the Washington State Constitution and State Law.
