The Foundation operates an amicus program and has an interest in the rights of persons seeking redress under the civil justice system, including an interest in the interpretation of the Washington Product Liability Act, ch. 7. 72 RCW (WPLA). II.INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE CASE This case presents the Court with the opportunity to decide whether Washington's learned intermediary doctrine (LID) -a common law exception to manufacturers' duty to warn -should apply when prescription drug manufacturers engage in direct-to consumer marketing (DTCM). The facts are drawn from the certification order and the parties' briefs. See Dearinger v. Eli Lilly and Company, No. C21-0060-JCC, 2021 WL 2805328 (W.D.Wash. July 6, 2021); Op. Br. at 5-19; Resp. Br. at 4-12. 1 Background Regarding DTCM of Prescription Drugs 1 Manufacturers of prescription products historically focused their marketing on medical providers. See Cecilia Plaza, Cutting out the Middleman: Empirically Testing the Continued Applicability of the Learned Intermediary Rule in the Age of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Pharmaceuticals, 24 Quinnipiac L.J. 393,403, 405 (2021 ). In the early 1980s, however, manufacturers introduced DTCM of prescription drugs, and it has since grown exponentially. See Plaza at 403; Op. Br. at 25. From 1997-2016, DTCM increased from $2.1 billion to $9.6 billion. See Lisa M.Schwartz, et al., Medical Marketing in the United States, 1997-2016, J.Am. Med. Ass'n, Vol. 321, No. 1, 80 (2019). From 2016-2018, $17.8 billion was spent on DTCM.See U.S.Gov't Accountability Office, GAO 21-380, Prescription Drugs: Medicare Spending on Drugs with Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, at 9 (May, 2021). 1 The materials cited herein offer important factual context for the public policies that bear on the certified question. Courts may take judicial notice of "legislative facts" that "supply premises in the process of legal reasoning." Wyman v. Wallace, 94 Wn.2d 99, 102, 615 P.2d 452 (1980) (citation omitted). Of course, if the Court requires additional factual or legal analysis, it may request further briefing. 2 One study reports that DTCM television ads generally do not appeal to "rational consideration of medical costs and benefits." See Dominick L.Frosch, et al., Creating Demand/or Prescription Drugs: A Content Analysis of Television Direct-to Consumer Advertising, Ann. Fam. Med., Vol. 5, No. 1, 6, 12 (2007). Some ads include "find a doctor" features directing consumers to providers willing to prescribe particular pharmaceuticals; others encourage consumers to schedule "telemedicine" visits and obtain prescription drugs from home. See Schwartz at 88. Ads tend to be "low quality," offering anecdotes and testimonials, and presenting little quantifiable or educational information. See id.; Frosch, at 6. A follow-up to the Frosch study reported that ad quality is declining, disproportionately emphasizing drug benefits through emotional appeals at the expense of education. See Janelle Applequist, et al., An Updated Analysis of Direct-to-Consumer Television Advertisements for Prescription Drugs, Ann. Fam. Med., Vol. 16, No. 3, 211, 214-15 (2018). There is concern that DTCM increases "medicalization" of natural human experiences, encouraging drug use that is both unnecessary and risky. See 3 Frosch, at 10. By highlighting efficacy and presenting lifestyle images depicting (cid:179)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87) case (cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:180) DTCM ads (cid:179)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87) and inflate (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182) expectations about what prescription drugs can (cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:17)(cid:180) Frosch, at 12. Only the United States and New Zealand permit DTCM of prescription drugs. See Schwartz, at 87. Many states have enacted legislation to control or limit DTCM, though Washington is not one of them. See Marketing and Advertising of Pharmaceuticals, (cid:49)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:182)(cid:79) Conf. of State Legislatures (Nov. 5, 2018). The American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians and the Institute of Medicine have all publicly opposed DTCM, with the AMA calling for an outright ban. See Schwartz, at 89; American College of Physicians, Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising Position Paper, at 1 (2006). FDA regulations impose a number of requirements on DTCM, including that it not be false, misleading or unbalanced. See 21 C.F.R. § 202.1(e) (2008). The FDA has had limited ability to enforce compliance, however. See Frosch, at 12; Ashley Porter, Old Habits Die Hard: Reforming the Learned Intermediary Doctrine in the Era of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising, 43 4 McGeorge Law Review 433, 443 & n.91 (2012). Despite a dramatic increase in DTCM promotional materials during the same time period, FDA warning letters dropped from 156 in 1997 to only 11 in 2016. See Schwartz, at 85. Disturbingly, violations increasingly reflect manufacturers' failure to adequately convey risk information. See id. Studies show DTCM significantly affects physicians' prescribing practices. Consumers disproportionately request DTCM drugs after viewing ads, and doctors frequently comply with such requests, including when they deem requests inappropriate. See Elizabeth Murray et al., Direct to Consumer Advertising: Physicians' Views of Its Effects on Quality of Care and the Doctor-Patient Relationship, J.Am. Board Fam. Pract. Vol. 16, No. 6,513, at 521-22. (Nov. 2003); Porter, at 452 & nn. 173 & 174 (2012); Schwartz, at 88-90. DTCM prescription drugs may pose umque dangers. Because of the period of exclusivity afforded by the patent and FDA approval processes when new drugs enter the market, there is substantial financial incentive to focus DTCM on new drugs. See Plaza, at 403. Unfortunately, new drugs lack the more robust 5 vetting that occurs once a drug is circulated, and its full risks may be unknown or underestimated. See Alina Baciu, et al., The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public, Institute of Medicine, Nat'l Academies Press, at 1-2. (2007). For this reason, the Institute of Medicine recommended a DTCM moratorium in the period immediately following FDA approval. See id. at 11; see also Schwartz, at 89. After the period of market exclusivity, the financial incentive for DTCM drops. Accordingly, DTCM is focused on a small percentage of total marketable drugs. There are currently over 20,000 prescription drugs approved for marketing in the United States. See U.S.Food & Drug Administration, FDA at a Glance (Nov. 2021). Yet the GAO reports that from 2016-2018, DTCM targeted only 500 drugs, with 67% of funds used to market just 39. See GAO-21-380, at 9, 11. Among the most heavily promoted prescription medications in the United States is Lilly's erectile dysfunction drug, Cialis. See Op. Br. 7-10. After Cialis received FDA approval in 2003, Lilly launched an ambitious DTCM campaign. See id. In 2014, Cialis was number one in total dollars in 6 marketing, with $248. 7 million invested. See Allison Gilchrist, J 0 Most-Advertised Brand-Name Drugs, Pharmacy Times, Aug. 27, 2015. On January 17, 2018, Plaintiff David Dearinger suffered a stroke less than two hours after ingesting Cialis. The stroke left him paralyzed on his left side. The Cialis physician insert warned of "serious cardiovascular events, including . . . stroke." Dearinger, 2021 WL 2805328, at *1. However, the patient insert Dearinger received warned only of a risk of stroke if the drug "is taken with certain other medications." Id. Dearinger brought this action under the WPLA, alleging, inter alia, failure to adequately warn of the risks associated with Cialis. Lilly moved to dismiss, asserting application of the LID.Recognizing this Court has not had the opportunity to address whether the LID applies when a manufacturer markets directly to consumers, the federal district court stayed Lilly's motion and certified the question below to this Court. III.ISSUE PRESENTED 7 Is a manufacturer that promotes a prescription drug through DTCM still exempt from warning the consumer of that drug's dangerous side effects under Washington's LID?2 IV.SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT The WPLA was enacted in 1981 and became the exclusive remedy for product liability claims. However, it carried forward many pre-existing common law principles, including the LID exception to manufacturers' duty to warn. The text of the WPLA, properly interpreted, reqmres warnings be provided directly to consumers. Without any support in the statutory language, the LID exception should be applied 2 This question does not address whether Cialis qualifies as an unavoidably unsafe product within the meaning of Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A comment k (1965). Whether prescription drugs are categorically considered unavoidably unsafe is an open question in Washington. Compare Young v. Key Pharm., Inc., 130 Wn.2d 160, 170, 922 P.2d 59 (1996) (Guy, J., 4-justice lead opinion stating prescription drugs categorically are unavoidably unsafe), with 130 Wn.2d at 179-88 (Madsen, J., 4-Justice dissent not concurring on this point of law). In Ruiz Guzman v. Amvac Chem. Corp., 141 Wn.2d 493, 508, 7 P.3d 795 (2000), the Court declined to resolve the question left open in Young. If the Court is inclined to consider this question, WSAJ Foundation is prepared to submit additional briefing. 8 sparingly and limited to its purposes, which are not served in the DTCM context. Neither concern for consumer confusion nor fear of excessive liability supports a contrary conclusion. Manufacturers already have an obligation to directly warn consumers, including for nonprescription drugs. Warnings need only be "adequate," and manufacturers have tools available to craft effective drug warnings. DTCM occupies only a small fraction of the prescription drug market, and whether to directly advertise and thereby assume a duty to directly warn is ultimately within the control of the manufacturer. Lilly's selected outside authorities provide no basis for departing from Washington law. Washington's comprehensive statutory scheme and decades of case law provide clear guidance to resolve the certified question. To the extent the Court deems outside sources persuasive at all, Lilly exaggerates the consensus among these authorities. The Court should apply Washington law and answer "no" to the certified question. V.ARGUMENT 9 Lilly asserts the certified question threatens to "abrogate deeply-established law." Resp. Br. at 20. However, the issue here is not whether to abandon the LID, but whether to recognize a narrow limitation to its application. In Wash. State Physicians Exch. & Ass'n v. Fisons Corp., 122 Wn.2d 299, 313, 858 P.2d 1054 (1993), this Court explained the LID was based on the "unique" relationship among drug companies, physicians, and patients, and the assumption that "the drug company targets its marketing efforts toward the physician, not toward the patient." DTCM upsets these assumptions, directly influencing consumers' expectations by circumventing the line of communication presumed by the LID.Recognizing the limitation proposed here 1s necessary to prevent DTCM from rendering products unreasonably unsafe by tipping the balance and distorting consumer expectations. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the text of the WPLA, disregard the assumptions underlying Washington's LID and frustrate the public safety purposes that undergird both. A.Overview Of Washington Product Liability Law, Including The LID. 10 In 1969, this Court adopted the strict liability standard from Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A (1965). See Ulmer v. Ford Motor Co., 75 Wn.2d 522, 530-32, 452 P.2d 729 (1969). In Seattle-First Nat'! Bank v. Tabert, 86 Wn.2d 145, 154, 542 P.2d 774 (1975), it clarified this standard focused on "the consumer's reasonable expectation of buying a product which is reasonably safe." Considering the "intrinsic nature" of the product, the factfinder determined whether it was unreasonably unsafe, based on factors such as cost, gravity of potential harm, and feasibility of minimizing risk. See Tabert, 86 Wn.2d at 154. These principles were later extended to duty to warn claims. See Teagle v. Fischer & Porter Co., 89 Wn.2d 149, 155, 570 P.2d 438 (1977). The Legislature enacted the WPLA in 1981. See Laws of 1981, ch. 27 (codified in RCW 7.72.010 et seq). RCW 7.72.030 codifies the three theories of strict product liability manufacturing defect, defective design, and failure to warn. While the WPLA preempts common law product liability, it carried forward many principles animating Washington's common law strict liability scheme. See RCW 7.72.020(1); 11 Macias v. Saberhagen Holdings, Inc., 175 Wn.2d 402,409,282 P.3d 1069 (2012). RCW 7.72.030(1) and (3) establish two independent grounds for strict liability for design defect and failure to warn. See Falk v. Keene Corp., 113 Wn.2d 645, 654, 782 P.2d 974 (1989). A product may be unsafe under either the risk-utility or consumer expectations test. See RCW 7.72.030(l)(a)-(b) & (3); Falk, 113 Wn.2d at 654. In Terhune v. A.H.Robins Co., 90 Wn.2d 9, 577 P.2d 975 (1978), this Court addressed a failure to warn claim involving a prescription medical product, establishing two rules of law. First, it adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A comment k (1965) as a limitation on common law strict liability for certain "unavoidably unsafe products." Second, it recognized an exception to manufacturers' duty to directly warn consumers, holding that adequacy of warnings in the prescription product context is measured by warnings to the doctor, not the patient, giving birth to the LID.See Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 12-14. Since Terhune, this Court has discussed the doctrine in four cases. See McKee v. American Home Prods. Corp., 113 Wn.2d 701, 709-12, 12 782 P.2d 1045 (1989); Fisons, 122 Wn.2d at 313; Young v. Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 130 Wn.2d 160, 167-68, 922 P.2d 59 (1996); Taylor v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 187 Wn.2d 743, 757-60, 389 P.3d 517 (2017). These cases did not meaningfully examine the extent to which the LID comports with the text of the WPLA, and none address whether the LID exception should apply to DTCM.B. The Court Should Limit The LID Exception To Its Purposes And Hold That It Is Inapplicable In The DTCM Context. In Ruiz-Guzman v. Amvac Chem. Corp., 141 Wn.2d 493, 506, 7 P.3d 795 (2000), this Court observed that the related doctrine of comment k "was not expressly provided for by the Legislature in adopting the WPLA." It cautioned that its use should be "sparing .. .lest we defeat the letter or policy of the WPLA." Id., 141 Wn.2d at 506. The same principle holds for the LID.Lacking any basis in the text of the WPLA, its application should be limited to its purposes, which are absent in the DTCM context. 1. There is no basis in the text of the WPLA for the LID, particularly in the DTCM context. 13 This Court has adopted the "plain meaning" rule of statutory interpretation, whereby meaning is gleaned from interpreting the statutory scheme in its full context. See Dep 't of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-12, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). Only if the text is ambiguous will the Court resort to rules of construction. See id, 146 Wn.2d at 12. Interpreted as a whole, the WPLA' s plain language requires product warnings be given directly to consumers. Preamble: The Legislature expressed its aim to "create a fairer and more equitable distribution ofliability among parties at fault." Laws of 1981, ch. 27 § I.While addressing concerns regarding msurance costs and "unwarranted" liability, particularly for "retail businesses located primarily in the state of Washington," it emphasized "the right of the consumer to recover for injuries sustained as a result of an unsafe product not be unduly impaired." Id. RCW 7.72.010(4) defines "product liability claim" to include "any claim or action brought for harm caused by" a range of product features and conduct, including "warnings" and 14 "marketing." The Legislature intended manufacturers' duties to attach where "marketing" renders a product unreasonably unsafe. RCW 7.72.030(1)(b), governing inadequate warnings, states an unsafe product is one "not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided with the product." In Taylor, a case involving a medical product, this Court interpreted the phrase "with the product." It held that the phrase required warnings to the physician be supplemented by warnings to the purchaser (a hospital). 3 A number of factors necessitated its conclusion: • the purchaser played an active role in the purchase and use, • the purchaser was well-situated to reduce the risk of harm, • the physician did not function in a typical intermediary capacity. 3 That Taylor noted the general applicability of the LID is unremarkable. Application of the LID as a general matter is not at issue here. Taylor is instructive as to when the phrase "with the product" should be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and require warnings to a purchaser to supplement those to the doctor. 15 See 187 Wn.2d at 755-58. The Court emphasized the LID should not foreclose additional required warnings where supplemental warnings facilitate public safety: Since the learned intermediary doctrine underscores the importance of patient safety, it would be illogical if the doctrine was used to excuse another avenue to achieve that goal. If patient safety is the goal, then it requires all hands on deck. 187 Wn.2d at 759-60. Sec .. 030(1)(b) should be interpreted in accordance with its plain text, which requires warnings be provided "with the product." "Adequate warnings" m § .030(1 )(b) further informs legislative intent. It is sufficiently broad to encompass consideration of warnings' recipients, substance, and manner of delivery. "Adequate," undefined in § .030(1 )(b ), means "fully sufficient for a specified or implied requirement." Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 25 (1993). Under § .030(1)(b), the "specified requirement" is that warnings render the product "reasonably safe." The factfinder should be permitted to determine whether a product was unsafe because DTCM influenced a consumer's expectations and rendered physician warnings alone "inadequate." 16 RCW 7.72.030(3) provides an independent basis for determining product safety, stating "the trier of fact shall consider whether the product was unsafe to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer." Under the LID, consumer expectations regarding a prescription drug's safety are presumed to be based on information from the physician. See Terhune, 90 Wn.2d at 14. DTCM upsets this presumption by promoting a drug directly to consumers. In such circumstances, under § .030(3), the trier of fact should be permitted to consider whether the absence of direct warnings render the product unsafe "beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer." Tabert explained that relative safety depends on what would be "contemplated by the ordinary consumer" who purchases a product "with the ordinary lmowledge common to the community as to its characteristics." Tabert, 86 Wn.2d at 150-51 (citation omitted). DTCM alters the "ordinary lmowledge common to the community" regarding the drug's relative safety. This should be included in the factfinding calculus. 17 Teagle applied Tabert's "ordinary consumer" test in evaluating adequacy of warnings, and indicated that consumer expectations may depend on manufacturers' product representations. There, the plaintiff was injured when the defendant's product -a "flowrater" -exploded. The explosion occurred when pressure exceeded 50 pounds per square inch (PSI), yet the manufacturer represented the product could withstand 400 psi. The Court held the manufacturer's representations should be considered in determining consumer expectations: In terms of the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer, given the fact that this flowrater was rated at 440 p.s.i., we believe reasonable persons could only conclude that this unguarded flowrater was not reasonably safe when it was sold without a warning. Teagle, 89 Wn.2d at 155-56; see also Restatement (Second) of Torts § 402A cmt. c ("public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries ... be placed upon those who market them"); Ayers v. Johnson & Johnson, 117 Wn.2d 747, 765-66, 818 P.2d 1337 (1991) (representation that baby oil is "pure and gentle" contributed to consumer's misconception regarding risks, 18 permitting factfinder to conclude product was unsafe beyond expectations of ordinary consumer). DTCM ads "distort and inflate consumers' expectations." Frosch, at 12. Sec .030(3) should be read in accordance with its plain language to permit the factfinder to consider whether the marketing of a product, not accompanied by adequate warnings, rendered the product "unsafe beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer." RCW 7. 72.050(1) permits consideration of evidence that a product violated administrative regulations. FDA regulations impose obligations on DTCM manufacturers to directly warn consumers. See 21 C.F.R. § 202. l(e) (2008). If the LID is applied here, it will squarely conflict with the clear language of§ .050(1). In sum, the WPLA plainly requires warnings be provided directly to consumers. Common law rules like the LID lacking a basis in the WPLA must be applied sparingly "lest we defeat the letter or policy of the WPLA," Ruiz-Guzman, 141 Wn.2d at 506. Applying the LID exception should require, at a minimum, that 19 its purposes are served; otherwise, it must yield to the unambiguous statutory text. 2. The assumptions underlying the LID are absent in the DTCM context. Terhune described the conceptual underpinnings of Washington's LID: [T]he physician acts as a "learned intennediary" between the manufacturer or seller and the patient. It is his duty to inform himself of the qualities and characteristics of those products which he prescribes for or administers to or uses on his patients, and to exercise an independent judgment, taking into account his knowledge of the patient as well as the product. The patient is expected to and, it can be presumed, does place primary reliance upon that judgment. The physician decides what facts should be told to the patient. Thus, if the product is properly labeled and carries the necessary instructions and warnings to fully apprise the physician of the proper procedures for use and the dangers involved, the manufacturer may reasonably assume that the physician will exercise the informed judgment thereby gained in conjunction with his own independent learning, in the best interest of the patient. It has also been suggested that the rule is made necessary by the fact that it is ordinarily difficult for the manufacturer to communicate directly with the consumer. 90 Wn.2d at 14 (brackets and emphasis added); see also Taylor, 187 Wn.2d at 757-58 (recognizing Terhune as announcing the principles underlying the LID). From this, four basic assumptions of Washington's LID may be gleaned: 1) physicians exercise "independent judgment," 20 2) patients place "primary reliance" on physicians, and 3) the "physician decides what facts should be told the patient," 4) it is "difficult for the manufacturer to communicate directly with the consumer." 90 Wn.2d at 14. Regarding 1) & 2), patients' "primary reliance" on physicians and physicians' "independent judgment" are compromised by DTCM.It prompts consumers to request DTCM products, alters physicians' prescribing practices, and increases the prescribing of DTCM products. See Murray, at 521-22; Schwartz, at 88-90. The effect is to reduce consumers' reliance on physicians and alter the judgment of physicians that is presumed to be "independent." Assumptions 3) & 4) are patently absent in the DTCM context. Manufacturers offer "facts" to consumers, which doctors have no power to filter. And with the explosion ofDTCM, it is no longer "difficult for the manufacturer to communicate directly with the consumer." 90 Wn.2d at 14. 21 The assumptions on which Washington's LID is based are not present in the DTCM context. 3. Recognizing the narrow limitation proposed here would be neither harmful to the public nor unduly burdensome for manufacturers. Lilly warns that limiting the LID as proposed here would result in "greater confusion, less precision, and ultimately greater risk to patients." Resp. Br. at 30. This Court in McKee expressed similar concerns. See 113 Wn.2d at 719. These concerns should not override the plain language of the WPLA.McKee assumed a world in which the predicates of the LID were present. See 113 Wn.2d at 711. DTCM manufacturers interject themselves into the physician-patient line of communication and promote product benefits; warnings are needed to clarify and supplement promotional information. Research demonstrates that consumers exposed to DTCM are far more likely to seek information about a product from sources other than the prescriber, most commonly the internet. See Plaza, at 429. When consumers are exposed to DTCM, it is not a matter of whether they will consume information outside the physician-22 patient relationship, but rather where the infonnation will come from and how educational and reliable it will be. Manufacturers already have a general duty to directly warn consumers -the LID is itself an exception to this duty. Many products have complicated risks, including, for example, nonprescription drugs; the solution to the risk of potential confusion is not to relieve manufacturers of their obligation to warn. Rather, it is to require warnings be "adequate," or "fully sufficient for a specified requirement." Of course, consumers must still establish adequate warnings could have been provided. See RCW 7.72.030(1)(b). Additionally, plaintiffs must prove proximate cause, which in this context should require proof that the consumer relied upon DTCM.See Plaza, at 453-55. Changes in the pharmaceutical industry and information technology provide manufacturers with tools for crafting adequate warnings. As platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook urge and facilitate a shift ofDTCM to social and digital media, see Schwartz, at 90, manufacturers can employ the interactive functions of those media to simplify and customize warnings. See Andrew Andrzejewski, Direct-to-Consumer Calls 23 to Action: Lowering the Volume of Claims and Disclosures in Prescription Drug Broadcast Advertisements, 84 BKNLR 571, 589 & nn. 135 & 136 (2019) (citing FDA draft proposals recognizing internet resources for conveying risk information). Because DTCM products occupy only a tiny percentage of the prescription drug market, the limitation proposed here would affect only a small minority of products and should not be unduly burdensome. See GAO-21-380, at 11. And ultimately, whether a manufacturer assumes a duty to directly warn consumers is wholly within its power, as it decides whether to directly advertise to consumers. 4. Lilly's selected authorities provide no basis for departing from the clear import of Washington law. This case should be resolved on the basis of Washington product liability law. Looking outside Washington has generally been seen as having marginal value because of the variations in substantive product liability law among jurisdictions. See, e.g., Ryder v. Kelly-Springfield Tire Co., 91 Wn.2d 111, 117-19, 587 P.2d 160 (1978); Ayers, 117 Wn.2d at 763-64. 24 To the extent the Court is inclined to look elsewhere for guidance, the state of the law is far more diverse than Lilly suggests. See Resp. Br. at 1-4, 47-66 (declaring broad consensus among jurisdictions); but see Joshua E.Perry, et al., Trust in the Balance: Prescription Drug Risks, Patient Perspectives, and Legal (Re)considerations, 24 J.Health Care L. & Pol'y 27, 41 & n.59 (2021) (surveying research and cases that suggest that the extent of the LID's application and its exceptions is complicated and disputed); State ex rel. Johnson & Johnson Corp. v. Karl, 647 S.E. 2d 899, 903-05 (W.Va. 2007) (collecting cases and concluding purported agreement regarding the LID is overstated). The majority of Lilly's cited cases merely acknowledge or adopt the LID, without addressing exceptions to the doctrine. See Resp. Br. at 4 7-66. Other cited cases suggesting broad support for the LID are outdated. Compare, e.g., Hill v. Squibb & Sons, E.R., 592 P.2d 1383, 181 Mont. 199 (1979), with Stevens v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 247 P.3d244, 257-60 & n.6, 358 Mont. 474 (Mont. 2010) (noting LID and emerging exceptions, including DTCM). The New Jersey Supreme Court expressly adopted the DTCM exception. See Perez v. Wyeth Labs. Inc., 734 A.2d 1245, 25 1256-57, 161 N.J. 1 (N.J. 1999). The West Virginia Supreme Court rejected the LID altogether, based in part on the modem emergence of DTCM.See Karl, 647 S.E.2d at 907-14 4 In Massachusetts, the Court adopted the LID, but recognized an exception for oral contraceptives. See Cottam v. CVS Pharm., 764 N.E.2d 814, 821 (Mass. 2002). In Rimbertv. Eli Lilly & Co., 577 F.Supp.2d 1174, 1214, 1218 (D.N.M. 2008), a federal district court predicted that the New Mexico Supreme Court would not adopt the LID, largely due to the emergence of DTCM.The Supreme Court of Oklahoma adopted an exception to the LID where FDA regulations require direct warnings and warnings fail to adequately apprise consumers of drugs' inherent risks. See Edwards v. Basel Pharm., 933 P.2d 298, 303 (Okla. 1997). Some jurisdictions have adopted the Restatement (Third) of Torts § 6(d) (1998) as their versions of the LID.See, e.g., Watts v. Medicis Pharm. Corp., 365 P.3d 944, 949, 239 Ariz. 19 (Ariz. 2016); Larkin v. Pfizer, Inc., 153 SW.3d 758, 770 (Ky. 2004); Freeman v. Hoffman LaRoche, Inc., 618 N.W.2d 827, 842, 260 4 West Virginia subsequently adopted the LID by statute. See WVC § 55-7-3. Since its enactment, the Court has not addressed the propriety of a DTCM exception. 26 Neb. 552 (Neb. 2000). Restatement (Third) incorporates a general exception to the LID, recognizing that direct warnings may be necessary where physicians' intermediary role is compromised. See § 6( d) (LID exception appropriate if "health-care providers will not be in a position to reduce the risks of harm in accordance with the instructions or warnings"); see also § 6( d) cmt. e (listing exceptions to the LID for DTCM or where regulatory agencies mandate direct warnings). 5 The Restatement leaves to "developing case law" when exceptions to the LID will be appropriate. See § 6( d) cmt. e. Washington product liability law is an intricate framework that reflects decades of common law jurisprudence and statutory law, and that framework provides ample guidance to resolve the issue presented here. The Court's analysis of the certified question is best grounded in Washington law. VI.CONCLUSION 'The Third Restatement differs from Washington strict liability jurisprudence in that it has incorporated a negligence standard. See Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings, 165 Wn.2d 373, 384 n.5, 198 P.3d 493 (2008). However, analysis regarding appropriate exceptions to the LID may be instructive here. 27 As DTCM grows and patients consume more information outside the context of the physician-patient relationship, administrative bodies, legislatures and courts must craft rules to address the emerging public policy issues this creates. FDA regulations alone have proven insufficient, and there is no indication manufacturers will police themselves. See Applequist, at 215 (noting Frosch Study's suggestions to manufacturers for improvement of ad quality "have not been heeded"). Tort law is well-situated to check the market forces that drive manufacturers' DTCM decisions and to address the harms DTCM inflicts. See Eastwoodv. Horse Harbor Foundation, Inc., 170 Wn.2d 380, 407-08, 241 P.3d 1256 (2010) (Chambers, J., concurring) (recognizing the role of tort in vindicating social policy). Manufacturers already have a tort duty to directly warn consumers. The limitation here respects the text of the WPLA and serves the purposes of the LID.The Court should answer "no" to the certified question. 28 This document contains 4991 words, excluding the parts of the document exempted from the word count by RAP 18.17.

U.S.Food & Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring, MD 20993 FDA.GOV ifi¥41!#11B4i Our E: Subscribe to Marketing and Advertising of Pharmaceuticals 11 /S/2018 This report is a compendium of state laws and related resources describing or affecting the marketing and advertising of pharmaceuticals, Including disclosure of information relating to the practices. NOTE: Parts of the tables of enacted laws are an archive report, researched, pasted and updated as of 2010. Please note the dates related to legislation and st laws. Numerous states have attempted to legislate different aspects of DTCA, including advertising, marketing, and doctor detailing and counter-detailing. The tables below summarize measures that were enacted. Soaring drug costs have become a matter of concern for lawmakers and their constituents, especially those on fixe incomes. One question is just how much is advertising on television and in the popular press contributing to these increased costs. An early analysis provided by the managed care industry for 1999 to 2000 reported that prescriptions written for the top 50 most heavily advertised drugs rose 24.E percent, compared to 4.3 percent for all other drugs combined.1 With pressure to try to curb the increased costs of prescription medicine, lawmakers have taken a closer look at the implications of pricey advertisements on state-funded programs. At an estimated annual cost of $2.S billion, pharmaceutical advertising to consur made drug companies and their brand products household names, Legislative lawyers point out that it is nearly impossible for individual states to control national advertisements, now regulated by the Food and Drug Administratior But that did not prevent some states from seeking solutions. Back in 2001, 12 states considered bills regarding direct-to-consumer advertising, and at least one-We: Virginia-enacted a law that gives the director of the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency discretion to use "innovative strategies," such as requiring prescription drug manufacturers to show how much they're spending on advertising and what that adds to drug costs. However the director, Tom Susman, stated that West Virginia will most likely train a team of pharmacists to meet with and educate doctors about the fiscal impacts prescribing higher priced and advertised drugs. "The pharmaceutical industry [representatives] don't talk about costs," Susman stated, "We go in and educate [doct about less expensive and therapeutic equivalent drugs and then they can make decisions to use less costly generics." Susman added that physicians [who participa· Medicaid] have an incentive to prescribe less costly drugs. "With only so much money to go around and using less expensive drugs, we have more money to put int( paying the West Virginia physicians'." Enacted State Laws: As of December 2012, ten states: California (2004), Connecticut, Florida (2006) Maine (2003 2005 2007), Massachusetts (2008), Minnesota (1993), New Hampshire (2006), South Carolina (2006), Vermont (2QQL lQQZ, 2.Q.Qill, West Virginia (2001) and the District of Columbia (2003, 2008), have laws or resolutions affecting pharmaceutical marketing. A separate Texas law (2007) requires a state-sponsored public awareness campaign to educate consumers about marketing solicitations by email or Internet. Texas (2009} also has required a study regarding the confidentiality of prescription information records. The specific provisions dif among these states - refer to details in the charts below. Note that states such as Maine and Vermont each have two or more separate laws, enacted in different ye Measures that passed both legislative chambers in California and Colorado but were vetoed are not included in the tally above, As of late 201 o three states-Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Vermont-require drug companies to disclose payments to prescribers and make some of that data public. While each of these states takes a different approach to collecting and making the payment data available to the public (more on that here), information fror three have disclosed the dimensions and scope of marketing relationships. Recognizing the policy concern, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) issued a voluntary code of behavior for its member companies, effective July 2002 and updated as of 2013: (cid:127) SEE: Code on Interactions With Health Care Professionals, at http://www.phrma.org/codes-and-guidelines/code-on-interactions-with-health-care-professional Federal Health Reform: Provision for "Sunshine Rule" Brings Disclosure by Drug and Device Manufactures The ACA includes a less-known provision (Section 6002), called the "National Physician Payment Transparency Program," or "OPENPAYMENTS."The CMS publish the final ru.J.e. on Feb. 8, which requires that manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, medical devices and supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Heal Insurance Program (CHIP) report payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, The final rule also requires manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to disclose physician ownership or investment interests. They must also disclose what they pay to doctors for purposes such as consulting or speaking on behalf of the manufacturer or a specific drug. See latest explanation and 2016 data here: https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/ CMS released the data on a public website beginning Sept. 30, 2014. Federal Analysis and Background In 2003, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (DIG) published the Compliance Program Guidance for PharmaceutiCi Manufacturers_(see 68 FR 23731-01 ). urging pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or review their existing programs. As outlined by the 01 many gifts, free samples, educational seminars, entertainment and consulting arrangements are practices that risk criminal liability under the federal anti-kickback statute (see 42 U S.C.A. 1320a-7b(bJ..'.'...Criminal penalties for acts involving Federal health care programs") whenever the intent of the activity is to increase business. time the activity provides a benefit to the physician with the intent to "induce or reward referrals" of federal health care business it violates the anti-kickback statute even if the activity has a legitimate purpose. (Updated 2018) In addition to the federal anti-kickback statute and the voluntary guidelines, many states also have their own anti-kickback statutes and many have Medicaid fraud statutes that include anti-kickback provisions. Some states also now require pharmaceutical companies to report annually the amount they spend on specified marketing activities. This survey includes statutes relating to gifts, samples, donations, bribes, and kickbacks by pharmaceutical companies or their representatives doctors.

This Section states a special rule applicable to sellers of products. The rule is one of strict liability, making the seller subject to liability to the user or consumer even though he has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product. The Section is inserted in the Chapter dealing with the negligence liability of suppliers of chattels, for convenience ofreference and comparison with other Sections dealing with negligence. The rule stated here is not exclusive, and does not preclude liability based upon the alternative ground of negligence of the seller, where such negligence can be proved. b. History. Since the early days of the common law those engaged in the business of selling food intended for human consumption have been held to a high degree of responsibility for their products. As long ago as 1266 there were enacted special criminal statutes imposing penalties upon victualers, vintners, brewers, butchers, cooks, and other persons who supplied "corrupt" food and drink. In the earlier part of this century this ancient attitude was reflected in a series of decisions in which the courts of a number of states sought to fmd some method of holding the seller of food liable to the ultimate consumer even though there was no showing of negligence on the part of the seller. These decisions represented a departure from, and an exception to, the general rule that a supplier of chattels was not liable to third persons in the absence of negligence or privily of contract. In the beginning, these decisions displayed considerable ingenuity in evolving more or less fictitious theories of liability to fit the case. The various devices included an agency of the intermediate dealer or another to purchase for the consumer, or to sell for the seller; a theoretical assignment of the seller's warranty to the intermediate dealer; a third party beneficiary contract; and an implied representation that the food was fit for consumption because it was placed on the market, as well as numerous others. In later years the courts have become more or less agreed upon the theory of a "wananty" from the seller to the consumer, either "running with the goods" by analogy to a covenant running with the land, or made directly to the consumer. Other decisions have indicated that the basis is merely one of strict liability in tort, which is not dependent upon either contract or negligence. Recent decisions, since 1950, have extended this special rule of strict liability beyond the seller of food for human consumption. The first extension was into the closely analogous cases of other products intended for intimate bodily use, where, for example, as in the case of cosmetics, the application to the body of the consumer is external rather than internal. Beginning in 1958 with a Michigan case involving cinder building blocks, a number of recent decisions have discarded any limitation to intimate association with the body, and have extended the rule of strict liability to cover the sale of any product which, if it should prove to be defective, may be expected to cause physical harm to the consumer or his property. c. On whatever theory, the justification for the strict liability has been said to be that the seller, by marketing his product for use and consumption, has undertaken and assumed a special responsibility toward any member of the consuming public who may be injured by it; that the public has the right to and does expect, in the case of products which it needs and for which it is forced to rely upon the seller, that reputable sellers will stand behind their goods; that public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them, and be treated as a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained; and that the consumer of such products is entitled to the maximum of protection at the hands of someone, and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products. d. The rule stated in this Section is not limited to the sale of food for human consumption, or other products for intimate bodily use, although it will obviously include them. It extends to any product sold in the condition, or substantially the same condition, in which it is expected to reach the ultimate user or consumer. Thus the rule stated applies to an automobile, a tire, an airplane, a grinding wheel, a water heater, a gas stove, a power tool, a riveting machine, a chair, and an insecticide. It applies also to products which, if they are defective, may be expected to and do cause only "physical harm" in the form of damage to the user's land or chattels, as in the case of animal food or a herbicide. e. Normally the rule stated in this Section will be applied to articles which already have undergone some processing before sale, since there is today little in the way of consumer products which will reach the consumer without such processing. The rule is not, however, so limited, and the supplier of poisonous mushrooms which are neither cooked, canned, packaged, nor otherwise treated is subject to the liability here stated. Wf'STLIW/ © 2021 Thomson Reute1·s. 1,10 claim to original U.S.Government Works. 2 § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... f Business of selling. The rule stated in this Section applies to any person engaged in the business of selling products for use or consumption. It therefore applies to any manufacturer of such a product, to any wholesale or retail dealer or distributor, and to the operator of a restaurant. It is not necessary that the seller be engaged solely in the business of selling such products. Thus the rule applies to the owner of a motion picture theatre who sells popcorn or ice cream, either for consumption on the premises or in packages to be taken home. The rule does not, however, apply to the occasional seller of food or other such products who is not engaged in that activity as a part of his business. Thus it does not apply to the housewife who, on one occasion, sells to her neighbor a jar of jam or a pound of sugar. Nor does it apply to the owner of an automobile who, on one occasion, sells it to his neighbor, or even sells it to a dealer in used cars, and this even though he is fully aware that the dealer plans to resell it. The basis for the rule is the ancient one of the special responsibility for the safety of the public undertaken by one who enters into the business of supplying human beings with products which may endanger the safety of their persons and property, and the forced reliance upon that undertaking on the part of those who purchase such goods. This basis is lacking in the case of the ordinary individual who makes the isolated sale, and he is not liable to a third person, or even to his buyer, in the absence of his negligence. An analogy may be found in the provision of the Uniform Sales Act,§ 15, which limits the implied warranty of merchantable quality to sellers who deal in such goods; and in the similar limitation of the Uniform Connnercial Code,§ 2-314, to a seller who is a merchant. This Section is also not intended to apply to sales of the stock of merchants out of the usual course of business, such as execution sales, bankruptcy sales, bulk sales, and the like. g. Defective condition. The rule stated in this Section applies only where the product is, at the time it leaves the seller's hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him. The seller is not liable when he delivers the product in a safe condition, and subsequent mishandling or other causes make it harmful by the time it is consumed. The burden of proof that the product was in a defective condition at the time that it left the hands of the particular seller is upon the injured plaintiff; and unless evidence can be produced which will support the conclusion that it was then defective, the burden is not sustained. Safe condition at the time of delivery by the seller will, however, include proper packaging, necessary sterilization, and other precautions required to permit the product to remain safe for a normal length of time when handled in a normal manner. h. A product is not in a defective condition when it is safe for normal handling and consumption. If the injury results from abnormal handling, as where a bottled beverage is knocked against a radiator to remove the cap, or from abnormal preparation for use, as where too much salt is added to food, or from abnormal consumption, as where a child eats too much candy and is made ill, the seller is not liable. Where, however, he has reason to anticipate that danger may result from a particular use, as where a drug is sold which is safe only in limited doses, he may be required to give adequate warning of the danger (see Comment}), and a product sold without such warning is in a defective condition. The defective condition may arise not only from harmful ingredients, not characteristic of the product itself either as to presence or quantity, but also from foreign objects contained in the product, from decay or deterioration before sale, or from the way in which the product is prepared or packed. No reason is apparent for distinguishing between the product itself and the container in which it is supplied; and the two are purchased by the user or consumer as an integrated whole. Where the container is itself dangerous, the product is sold in a defective condition. Thus a carbonated beverage in a bottle which is so weak, or cracked, or jagged at the edges, or bottled under such excessive pressure that it may explode or otherwise cause harm to the person who handles it, is in a defective and dangerous condition. The container cannot logically be separated from the contents when the two are sold as a unit, and the liability stated in this Section arises not only when the consumer drinks the beverage and is poisoned by it, but also when he is injured by the bottle while he is handling it preparatory to consumption. i. Unreasonably dangeraus. The rule stated in this Section applies only where the defective condition of the product makes it tmreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Many products cannot possibly be made entirely safe for all consumption, WES!lA.W © 2021 Tl10rnson Reuters. No clciirn to oriqinal U.S.Government Works. 3 § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... and any food or drug necessarily involves some risk of harm, if only from over-consumption. Ordinary sugar is a deadly poison to diabetics, and castor oil found use under Mussolini as an instrument of torture. That is not what is meant by "unreasonably dangerous" in this Section. The article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics. Good whiskey is not unreasonably dangerous merely because it will make some people drunk, and is especially dangerous to alcoholics; but bad whiskey, containing a dangerous amount of fuel oil, is unreasonably dangerous. Good tobacco is not unreasonably dangerous merely because the effects of smoking may be harmful; but tobacco containing something like marijuana may be unreasonably dangerous. Good butter is not unreasonably dangerous merely because, if such be the case, it deposits cholesterol in the arteries and leads to heart attacks; but bad butter, contaminated with poisonous fish oil, is unreasonably dangerous. ). Directions or warning. In order to prevent the product from being unreasonably dangerous, the seller may be required to give directions or warning, on the container, as to its use. The seller may reasonably assume that those with common allergies, as for example to eggs or strawberries, will be aware of them, and he is not required to warn against them. Where, however, the product contains an ingredient to which a substantial number of the population are allergic, and the ingredient is one whose danger is not generally known, or if known is one which the consumer would reasonably not expect to find in the product, the seller is required to give warning against it, ifhe has knowledge, or by the application ofreasonable, developed human skill and foresight should have knowledge, of the presence of the ingredient and the danger. Likewise in the case of poisonous drugs, or those unduly dangerous for other reasons, warning as to use may be required. But a seller is not required to warn with respect to products, or ingredients in them, which are only dangerous, or potentially so, when consumed in excessive quantity, or over a long period of time, when the danger, or potentiality of danger, is generally known and recognized. Again the dangers of alcoholic beverages are an example, as are also those of foods containing such substances as saturated fats, which may over a period of time have a deleterious effect upon the human heart. Where warning is given, the seller may reasonably assume that it will be read and heeded; and a product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. k. Unavoidably unsafe products. There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially common in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk. /. User or consumer. In order for the rnle stated in this Section to apply, it is not necessruy that the ultimate user or consumer have acquired the product directly from the seller, although the rule applies equally ifhe does so. He may have acquired it through one or more intermediate dealers. It is not even necessary that the consumer have purchased the product at all. He may be a member of the family of the final purchaser, or his employee, or a guest at his table, or a mere donee from the purchaser. The liability stated is one in tort, and does not require any contractual relation, or privily of contract, between the plaintiff and the defendant. WEST! AW © 202·1 Tl1omso11 l~euters.

Consumption includes all ultimate uses for which the product is intended, and the customer in a beauty shop to whose hair a permanent wave solution is applied by the shop is a consumer. "User" includes those who are passively enjoying the benefit of the product, as in the case of passengers in automobiles or airplanes, as well as those who are utilizing it for the purpose of doing work upon it, as in the case ofan employee of the ultimate buyer who is making repairs upon the automobile which he has purchased. Illustration: 1. A manufactures and packs a can of beans, which he sells to B, a wholesaler. B sells the beans to C, a jobber, who resells it to D, a retail grocer. E buys the can of beans from D, and gives it to F.F serves the beans at lunch to G, his guest. While eating the beans, G breaks a tooth, on a pebble of the size, shape, and color of a bean, which no reasonable inspection could possibly have discovered. There is satisfactory evidence that the pebble was in the can of beans when it was opened. Although there is no negligence on the part of A, B, C, or D, each of them is subject to liability to G.On the other hand E and F, who have not sold the beans, are not liable to Gin the absence of some negligence on their part. m. "Warranty." The liability stated in this Section does not rest upon negligence. It is strict liability, similar in its nature to that covered by Chapters 20 and 21. The basis ofliability is purely one of tort. A number of courts, seeking a theoretical basis for the liability, have resorted to a "warranty," either running with the goods sold, by analogy to covenants running with the land, or made directly to the consumer without contract. In some instances this theory has proved to be an unfortunate one. Although warranty was in its origin a matter of tort liability, and it is generally agreed that a tort action will still lie for its breach, it has become so identified in practice with a contract of sale between the plaintiff and the defendant that the warranty theory has become something of an obstacle to the recognition of the strict liability where there is no such contract. There is nothing in this Section which would prevent any court from treating the rule stated as a matter of"warranty" to the user or consumer. But if this is done, it should be recognized and understood that the "warranty" is a very different kind of warranty from those usually found in the sale of goods, and that it is not subject to the various contract rules which have grown up to surround such sales. The rule stated in this Section does not require any reliance on the part of tl1e consumer upon the reputation, skill, or judgment of the seller who is to be held liable, nor any representation or undertaking on the part of that seller. The seller is strictly liable although, as is frequently the case, the consumer does not even know who he is at the time of consumption. The rule stated in this Section is not governed by the provisions of the Uniform Sales Act, or those of the Uniform Commercial Code, as to warranties; and it is not affected by limitations on the scope and content of warranties, or by limitation to "buyer" and "seller" in those statutes. Nor is the consumer required to give notice to the seller of his injury within a reasonable time after it occurs, as is provided by the Uniform Act. The consumer's cause of action does not depend upon the validity of his contract with the person from whom he acquires the product, and it is not affected by any disclaimer or other agreement, whether it be between the seller and his immediate buyer, or attached to and accompanying the product into the consumer's hands.

U.S. (Joverninent Works. 5 § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical ... , Restatement (Second) ... must be given a new and different meaning if it is used in connection with this Section. It is much simpler to regard the liability here stated as merely one of strict liability in tort. n. Contributory negligence. Since the liability with which this Section deals is not based upon negligence of the seller, but is strict liability, the rule applied to strict liability cases (see § 524) applies. Contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not a defense when such negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect in the product, or to guard against the possibility of its existence. On the other hand the form of contributory negligence which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the name of assumption of risk, is a defense under this Section as in other cases of strict liability. If the user or consmner discovers the defect and is aware of the danger, and nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the product and is injured by it, he is baiTed from recove1y. Comment on Caveat: o. J,yuries to non-users and non-consumers. Thus far the courts, in applying the rule stated in this Section, have not gone beyond allowing recovery to users and consumers, as those terms are defined in Comment I, Casual bystanders, and others who may come in contact with the product, as in the case of employees of the retailer, or a passer-by injured by an exploding bottle, or a pedestrian hit by an automobile, have been denied recovery. There may be no essential reason why such plaintiffs should not be brought within the scope of the protection afforded, other than that they do not have the same reasons for expecting such protection as the consumer who buys a marketed product; but the social pressure which has been largely responsible for the development of the rule stated has been a consumers' pressure, and there is not the same demand for the protection of casual strangers. The Institute expresses neither approval nor disapproval of expansion of the rule to pe1mit recovery by such persons. p. Further processing or substantial change. Thus far the decisions applying the rule statedhavenot gone beyond products which are sold in the condition, or in substantially the same condition, in which they are expected to reach the hands of the ultimate user or consumer. In the absence of decisions providing a clue to the rules which are likely to develop, the Institute has refrained from taking any position as to the possible liability of the seller where the product is expected to, and does, undergo further processing or other substantial change after it leaves his hands and before it reaches those of the ultimate user or consumer. It seems reasonably clear that the mere fact that the product is to undergo processiug, or other substantial change, will not in all cases relieve the seller of liability under the rule stated in this Section. If, for example, raw coffee beans are sold to a buyer who roasts and packs them for sale to the ultimate consumer, it cannot be supposed that the seller will be relieved of all liability when the raw beans are contaminated with arsenic, or some other poison. Likewise the seller of an automobile with a defective steering gear which breaks and injures the driver, can scarcely expect to be relieved of the responsibility by reason of the fact that the car is sold to a dealer who is expected to "service" it, adjust the brakes, mount and inflate the tires, and the like, before it is ready for use. On the other hand, the manufacturer of pig iron, which is capable ofa wide variety ofuses, is not so likely to be held to strict liability when it turns out to be unsuitable for the child's tricycle into which it is finally made by a remote buyer. The question is essentially one of whether the responsibility for discovery and prevention of the dangerous defect is shifted to the intermediate party who is to make the changes. No doubt there will be some situations, and some defects, as to which the responsibility will be shifted, and others in which it will not. The existing decisions as yet throw no light upon the questions, and the Institute therefore expresses neither approval nor disapproval of the seller's strict liability in such a case. q. Component parts. The same problem arises in cases of the sale of a component part of a product to be assembled by another, as for example a tire to be placed on a new automobile, a brake cylinder for the same purpose, or an instrument for the panel of an airplane. Again the question arises, whether the responsibility is not shifted to the assembler. It is no doubt to be expected that where there is no change in the component part itself, but it is merely incorporated into something larger, the strict liability will be found to carry through to the ultimate user or consumer. But in the absence of a sufficient number of decisions on the matter to justify a conclusion, the Institute expresses no opinion on the matter. WE'STl.,Wv © 202·1 Thomson F{eulers. No claim to original U.c,. C3ovem111ent Works. 6 RCW 7.72.010 Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary: (1) Product seller. "Product seller" means any person or entity that is engaged in the business of selling products, whether the sale is for resale, or for use or consumption. The term includes a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer of the relevant product. The term also includes a party who is in the business of leasing or bailing such products. The term "product seller" does not include: (a) A seller of real property, unless that person is engaged in the mass production and sale of standardized dwellings or is otherwise a product seller; (b) A provider of professional services who utilizes or sells products within the legally authorized scope of the professional practice of the provider; (c) A commercial seller of used products who resells a product after use by a consumer or other product user: PROVIDED, That when it is resold, the used product is in essentially the same condition as when it was acquired for resale; (d) A finance lessor who is not otherwise a product seller. A "finance lessor" is one who acts in a financial capacity, who is not a manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer, and who leases a product without having a reasonable opportunity to inspect and discover defects in the product, under a lease arrangement in which the selection, possession, maintenance, and operation of the product are controlled by a person other than the lessor; and (e) A licensed pharmacist who dispenses a prescription product manufactured by a commercial manufacturer pursuant to a prescription issued by a licensed prescribing practitioner if the claim against the pharmacist is based upon strict liability in tort or the implied warranty provisions under the uniform commercial code, Title 62A RCW, and if the pharmacist complies with recordkeeping requirements pursuant to chapters 18.64, 69.41, and 69.50 RCW, and related administrative rules as provided in RCW 7.72.040. Nothing in this subsection (1 )(e) affects a pharmacist's liability under RCW 7.72.040(1 ). (2) Manufacturer. "Manufacturer" includes a product seller who designs, produces, makes, fabricates, constructs, or remanufactures the relevant product or component part of a product before its sale to a user or consumer. The term also includes a product seller or entity not otherwise a manufacturer that holds itself out as a manufacturer. A product seller acting primarily as a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer of a product may be a "manufacturer" but only to the extent that it designs, produces, makes, fabricates, constructs, or remanufactures the product for its sale. A product seller who performs minor assembly of a product in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer shall not be deemed a manufacturer. A product seller that did not participate in the design of a product and that constructed the product in accordance with the design specifications of the claimant or another product seller shall not be deemed a manufacturer for the purposes of RCW 7.72.030(1 )(a). (3) Product. "Product" means any object possessing intrinsic value, capable of delivery either as an assembled whole or as a component part or parts, and produced for introduction into trade or commerce. Human tissue and organs, including human blood and its components, are excluded from this term. The "relevant product" under this chapter is that product or its component part or parts, which gave rise to the product liability claim. (4) Product liability claim. "Product liability claim" includes any claim or action brought for harm caused by the manufacture, production, making, construction, fabrication, design, formula, preparation, assembly, installation, testing, warnings, instructions, marketing, packaging, storage or labeling of the relevant product. It includes, but is not limited to, any claim or action previously based on: Strict liability in tort; negligence; breach of express or implied warranty; breach of, or failure to, discharge a duty to warn or instruct, whether negligent or innocent; misrepresentation, concealment, or nondisclosure, whether negligent or innocent; or other claim or action previously based on any other substantive legal theory except fraud, intentionally caused harm or a claim or action under the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. (5) Claimant. "Claimant" means a person or entity asserting a product liability claim, including a wrongful death action, and, if the claim is asserted through or on behalf of an estate, the term includes claimant's decedent. "Claimant" includes any person or entity that suffers harm. A claim may be asserted under this chapter even though the claimant did not buy the product from, or enter into any contractual relationship with, the product seller. (6) Harm. "Harm" includes any damages recognized by the courts of this state: PROVIDED, That the term "harm" does not include direct or consequential economic loss under Title 62A RCW. [ 1991 C 189 § 3; 1981 C 27 § 2.] NOTES: Preamble-1981 c 27: "Tort reform in this state has for the most part been accomplished in the courts on a case-by-case basis. While this process has resulted in significant progress and the harshness of many common law doctrines has to some extent been ameliorated by decisional law, the legislature has from time to time felt it necessary to intervene to bring about needed reforms such as those contained in the 1973 comparative negligence act. The purpose of this amendatory act is to enact further reforms in the tort law to create a fairer and more equitable distribution of liability among parties at fault. Of particular concern is the area of tort law known as product liability law. Sharply rising premiums for product liability insurance have increased the cost of consumer and industrial goods. These increases in premiums have resulted in disincentives to industrial innovation and the development of new products. High product liability premiums may encourage product sellers and manufacturers to go without liability insurance or pass the high cost of insurance on to the consuming public in general. It is the intent of the legislature to treat the consuming public, the product seller, the product manufacturer, and the product liability insurer in a balanced fashion in order to deal with these problems. It is the intent of the legislature that the right of the consumer to recover for injuries sustained as a result of an unsafe product not be unduly impaired. It is further the intent of the legislature that retail businesses located primarily in the state of Washington be protected from the substantially increasing product liability insurance costs and unwarranted exposure to product liability litigation." [ 1981 c 27 § 1.] '-----~[2] RCW 7.72.030 Liability of manufacturer. (1) A product manufacturer is subject to liability to a claimant if the claimant's harm was proximately caused by the negligence of the manufacturer in that the product was not reasonably safe as designed or not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided. (a) A product is not reasonably safe as designed, if, at the time of manufacture, the likelihood that the product would cause the claimant's harm or similar harms, and the seriousness of those harms, outweighed the burden on the manufacturer to design a product that would have prevented those harms and the adverse effect that an alternative design that was practical and feasible would have on the usefulness of the product: PROVIDED, That a firearm or ammunition shall not be deemed defective in design on the basis that the benefits of the product do not outweigh the risk of injury posed by its potential to cause serious injury, damage, or death when discharged. (b) A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided with the product, if, at the time of manufacture, the likelihood that the product would cause the claimant's harm or similar harms, and the seriousness of those harms, rendered the warnings or instructions of the manufacturer inadequate and the manufacturer could have provided the warnings or instructions which the claimant alleges would have been adequate. (c) A product is not reasonably safe because adequate warnings or instructions were not provided after the product was manufactured where a manufacturer learned or where a reasonably prudent manufacturer should have learned about a danger connected with the product after it was manufactured. In such a case, the manufacturer is under a duty to act with regard to issuing warnings or instructions concerning the danger in the manner that a reasonably prudent manufacturer would act in the same or similar circumstances. This duty is satisfied if the manufacturer exercises reasonable care to inform product users. (2) A product manufacturer is subject to strict liability to a claimant if the claimant's harm was proximately caused by the fact that the product was not reasonably safe in construction or not reasonably safe because it did not conform to the manufacturer's express warranty or to the implied warranties under Title 62A RCW. (a) A product is not reasonably safe in construction if, when the product left the control of the manufacturer, the product deviated in some material way from the design specifications or performance standards of the manufacturer, or deviated in some material way from otherwise identical units of the same product line. {b) A product does not conform to the express warranty of the manufacturer if it is made part of the basis of the bargain and relates to a material fact or facts concerning the product and the express warranty proved to be untrue. (c) Whether or not a product conforms to an implied warranty created under Title 62A RCW shall be determined under that title. (3) In determining whether a product was not reasonably safe under this section, the trier of fact shall consider whether the product was unsafe to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer.

(1) Evidence of custom in the product seller's industry, technological feasibility or that the product was or was not, in compliance with nongovernmental standards or with legislative regulatory standards or administrative regulatory standards, whether relating to design, construction or performance of the product or to warnings or instructions as to its use may be considered by the trier of fact. (2) When the injury-causing aspect of the product was, at the time of manufacture, in compliance with a specific mandatory government contract specification relating to design or warnings, this compliance shall be an absolute defense. When the injury-causing aspect of the product was not, at the time of manufacture, in compliance with a specific mandatory government specification relating to design or warnings, the product shall be deemed not reasonably safe under RCW 7.72.030(1).

(2) Exempt advertisements. The following advertisements are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (e)(l) of this section under the conditions specified: (i) Reminder advertisements. Reminder advertisements are those which call attention to the name of the drug product but do not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product. These reminder advertisements shall contain only the proprietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no representation or suggestion relating to the advertised drug product. If the Commissioner fmds that there is evidence of significant incidence of fatalities or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder advertisements, other than those solely intended to convey price information including, but not limited to, those subject to the requirements of§ 200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use of the drug product. Reminder advertisements which are intended to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a prescription for a drug product are exempt from the requirements of this section if they meet all of the conditions contained in§ 200.200 of this chapter. Reminder advertisements, other than those subject to the requirements of § 200 .200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a drug for which an armouncement has been published pursuantto a review on the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than "possibly effective." If the Commissioner finds the circumstances are such that a reminder advertisement may be misleading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/ NRC evaluation, such advertisements will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either in the publication of the conclusions on the effectiveness of the drug or by letter. (ii) Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs. Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs that promote sale of the drug in bulk packages in accordance with the practice of the trade solely to be processed, manufactured, labeled, or repackaged in substantial quantities and that contain no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug. (iii) Advertisements of prescription-compounding chugs. Advertisements of prescription-compounding drugs that promote sale of a drug for use as a prescription chemical or other compound for use by registered pharmacists in compounding prescriptions if the drug otherwise complies with the conditions for the labeling exemption contained in § 201.120 and the advertisement contains no claims for the therapeutic safety or effectiveness of the drug. (3) Scope of information to be included; applicability to the entire advertisement. (i) The requirement of a true statement of information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness applies to the entire advertisement. Untrne or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by the inclusion in another distinct part of the advertisement of a brief statement containing true information relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness of the drug.

Comment: a. History. Subsections (b)(l) and (d)(l) state the traditional mies that dmg and medical-device manufacturers are liable only when their products contain manufacturing defects or are sold without adequate instructions and warnings to prescribing and other health-care providers. Until recently, courts refused to impose liability based on defective designs of drugs and medical devices sold only by prescription. However, consistent with recent trends in the case law, two limited exceptions from these traditional rules are generally recognized. Subsection ( d)(2) sets forth situations when a prescription-drug or medical-device manufacturer is required to warn the patient directly ofrisks associated with consumption or use of its product. And Subsection (c) imposes liability for a drug or medical device whose risks of harm so far outweigh its therapeutic benefits that reasonable, properly informed health-care providers would not prescribe it. b. Rationale. The obligation of a manufacturer to warn about risks attendant to the use of drugs and medical devices that may be sold only pursuant to a health-care provider's prescription traditionally has required warnings directed to health-care providers and not to patients. The rationale supporting this "learned intermediary" mle is that only health-care professionals are in a position to understand the significance of the risks involved and to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of a given form of prescription-based therapy. The duty then devolves on the health-care provider to supply to the patient such information as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances so that the patient can make an informed choice as to therapy. Subsection ( d) (I) retains the "learned intermediary" rule. However, in certain limited therapeutic relationships the physician or other health care provider has a much-diminished role as an evaluator or decisionmaker. In these instances it may be appropriate to impose on the manufacturer the duty to warn the patient directly. See Subsection ( d)(2). The traditional refusal by courts to impose tort liability for defective designs of prescription drugs and medical devices is based on the fact that a prescription dmg or medical device entails a unique set ofrisks and benefits. What may be harmful to one patient may be beneficial to another. Under Subsection (c) a drug is defectively designed only when it provides no net benefit to any class of patients. Courts have concluded that as long as a drug or medical device provides net benefits to some persons under some circumstances, the drug or device manufacturer should be required to instruct and warn health-care providers of the foreseeable risks and benefits. Courts have also recognized that the regulatory system governing prescription dmgs is a legitimate mechanism for setting the standards for drug design. In part, this deference reflects concerns over the possible negative effects of judicially imposed liability on the cost and availability of valuable medical technology. This deference also rests on two further assumptions: first, that prescribing health-care providers, when adequately informed by dmg manufacturers, are able to assure that the right drugs and medical devices reach the right patients; and second, that governmental regulatory agencies adequately review new prescription drugs and devices, keeping unreasonably dangerous designs off the market. Nevertheless, unqualified deference to these regulatory mechanisms is considered by a growing number of cmnts to be unjustified. An approved prescription dmg or medical device can present significant risks without corresponding advantages. At the same time, manufacturers must have ample discretion to develop useful dmgs and devices without subjecting their design decisions to the ordinary test applicable to products generally under § 2(b ). Accordingly, Subsection ( c) imposes a more rigorous test for defect than does § 2(b ), which does not apply to prescription drugs and medical devices. The requirement for establishing defective design of a prescription dmg or medical device under Subsection ( c) is that the drug or device have so little merit compared with its risks that reasonable health-care providers, possessing knowledge of risks that were known or reasonably should have been known, would not have prescribed the dmg or device for any class of patients. Thus, a prescription dmg or medical device that has usefulness to any class of patients is not defective in design even if it is harmful to other patients. WF.STLAW © 202·1 Thomson Reuters. ~lo claim to original LJ.S Government Works. 2 § 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm ... , Restatement (Third) of ... Because of the special nature of prescription drugs and medical devices, the determination of whether such products are not reasonably safe is to be made under Subsections ( c) and ( d) rather than under §§ 2(b) and 2( c). The rules imposing liability on a manufacturer for inadequate warning or defective design of prescription drugs and medical devices assume that the federal regulatory standard has not preempted the imposition of tort liability under state law. When such preemption is found, liability carmot attach if the manufacturer has complied with the applicable federal standard. See § 4, Comment e. The doctrine of preemption based on supremacy offederal law should be distinguished from the proposition that compliance with statutory and regulatory standards satisfies the state's requirement for product safety. Subsections ( c) and (d) recognize common law causes of action for defective drug design and for failure to provide reasonable instructions or warnings, even though the manufacturer complied with governmental standards. For the rules governing compliance with governmental standards generally, see § 4(b ). c. Manufacturers' liability for manufacturing defects. Limitations on the liability for prescription drug and medical-device designs do not support treating drug and medical-device manufacturers differently from commercial sellers of other products with respect to manufacturing defects. Courts have traditionally subjected manufacturers of prescription products to liability for harm caused by manufacturing defects. d. Manufacturers' liability for failure adequately to instruct or warn prescribing and other health-care praviders. Failure to instruct or warn is the major basis of liability for manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices. When prescribing health-care providers are adequately informed of the relevant benefits and risks associated with various prescription drugs and medical devices, they can reach appropriate decisions regarding which drug or device is best for specific patients. Sometimes a warning serves to inform health-care providers of unavoidable risks that inhere in the drug or medical device. By definition, such a warning would not aid the health-care provider in reducing the risk of injury to the patient by taking precautions in how the drug is administered or the medical device is used. However, warnings ofunavoidable risks allow the health-care provider, and thereby the patient, to make an informed choice whether to utilize the drug or medical device. Beyond informing prescribing health-care providers, a drug or device manufacturer may have a duty under the law of negligence to use reasonable measures to supply instructions or warnings to nonprescribing health-care providers who are in positions to act on such information so as to reduce or prevent injury to patients. e. Direct warnings to patients. Warnings and instructions with regard to drugs or medical devices that can be sold legally only pursuant to a prescription are, under the "learned intermediary" rule, directed to health-care providers. Subsection ( d)(2) recognizes that direct warnings and instructions to patients are warranted for dmgs that are dispensed or administered to patients without the personal intervention or evaluation of a health-care provider. An example is the administration of a vaccine in clinics where mass inoculations are performed. In many such programs, health-care providers are not in a position to evaluate the risks attendant upon use of the drug or device or to relate them to patients. When a manufacturer supplies prescription chugs for distribution to patients in this type of unsupervised envirornnent, if a direct warning to patients is feasible and can be effective, the law requires measures to that effect. Although the learned intermediary rule is generally accepted and a drug manufacturer fulfills its legal obligation to warn by providing adequate warnings to the health-care provider, arguments have been advanced that in two other areas courts should consider imposing tort liability on drug manufacturers that fail to provide direct warnings to consumers. In the first, governmental regulatory agencies have mandated that patients be info1med of risks attendant to the use of a drug. A noted example is the FDA requirement that birth control pills be sold to patients accompanied by a patient package insert. In the second, manufacturers have advertised a prescription drug and its indicated use in the mass media. Governmental regulations require that, when drugs are so advertised, they must be accompanied by appropriate information concerning risk so as to provide balanced advertising. The question in both instances is whether adequate warnings to the appropriate health-care provider should insulate the manufacturer from tort liability. Wt'STIAW © 2021 Tl1omson Reuters. No claim to ori,Ii11al U.S.Government Works. 3 § 6 Liability of Commercial Seller or Distributor for Harm ... , Restatement (Third) of ... Those who assert the need for adequate warnings directly to consumers contend that manufacturers that communicate directly with consumers should not escape liability simply because the decision to prescribe the drug was made by the health-care provider. Proponents of the learned intermediary rule argue that, notwithstanding direct communications to the consumer, drugs cannot be dispensed unless a health-care provider makes an individualized decision that a drug is appropriate for a particular patient, and that it is for the health-care provider to decide which risks are relevant to the particular patient. The Institute leaves to developing case law whether exceptions to the learned intermediary rule in these or other situations should be recognized. When the content of the warnings is mandated or approved by a governmental agency regulation and a court fmds that compliance with such regulation federally preempts tort liability, then no liability under this Section can attach. For the rules governing compliance with governmental standards generally, see § 4(b ). f Manufacturers' liability for defectively designed prescription drugs and medical devices. Subsection (c) reflects the judgment that, as long as a given drug or device provides net benefits for a class of patients, it should be available to them, accompanied by appropriate warnings and instructions. Learned intermediaries must generally be relied upon to see that the right drugs and devices reach the right patients. However, when a drug or device provides net benefits to no class of patients-when reasonable, informed health-care providers would not prescribe it to any class of patients-then the design of the product is defective and the manufacturer should be subject to liability for the harm caused. A prescription drug or device manufacturer defeats a plaintiffs design claim by establishing one or more contexts in which its product would be prescribed by reasonable, informed health-care providers. That some individual providers do, in fact, prescribe defendant's product does not in itself suffice to defeat the plaintiffs claim. Evidence regarding the actual conduct of health-care providers, while relevant and admissible, is not necessarily controlling. The issue is whether, objectively viewed, reasonable providers, knowing of the foreseeable risks and benefits of the drug or medical device, would prescribe it for any class of patients. Given this very demanding objective standard, liability is likely to be imposed only under unusual circumstances. The court has the responsibility to determine when the plaintiff has introduced sufficient evidence so that reasonable persons could conclude that plaintiff has met this demanding standard. Illustration: 1. ABC Pharmaceuticals manufactures and distributes D, a prescription drug intended to prolong pregnancy and thus to reduce the risks associated with premature birth. Patricia, six months pregnant with a history of irregular heart beats, was given D during a hospital stay in connection with her pregnancy. As a result, she suffered heart failure and required openMheart surge1y. In Patricia's action against ABC, her expert testifies that, notwithstanding FDA ap_proval of D five years prior to Patricia's taking the drug, credible studies P\lblished two years prior to Patricia's taking the drug concluded that D does not prolong pregnancy for any class of patients. Notwithstanding a finding by the trier of fact that ABC gave adequate warnings to the prescribing physician regarding the serious risks of heart failure in patients with a history of irregular heait beats, the trier of fact can find that reasonably informed health-care providers would not prescribe D for any class of patients, thus rendering ABC subject to liability.

Foreseeability of risks of harm in prescription drug and medical device cases. Duties concerning the design and marketing of prescription chugs and medical devices arise only with respect to risks of hann that are reasonably foreseeable at the time of sale. Imposing liability for unforeseeable risks can create inappropriate disincentives for the development of new drugs and therapeutic devices. Moreover, because actuaries cannot accurately assess unknown and unknowable risks, insuring against losses due to unknowable risks would be problematic. Drug and medical device manufacturers have the responsibility to perform reasonable testing prior to marketing a product and to discover risks and risk-avoidance measures that such testing would reveal. See § 2, Comments a and m. Illustrations: 2. DEF Pharmaceuticals, Inc., manufactures and distributes prescription drugs. Seven years ago DEF, after years of research and testing, received permission from the FDA to market X, a drug prescribed for the treatment of low-grade infections. Three years later, Jim, age 12, began taking X on his physician's prescription for a recun-ing respiratory-tract infection. Jim took X for approximately one year. Two years after Jim had stopped taking X, medical research discovered that X causes loss of vision in adolescents. Prior to this discovery DEF had not warned ofthis risk. Jim has begun to manifest symptoms of the sort caused by the drug. No evidence suggests that DEF's testing ofX was substandard, or that any reasonable drug company should have discovered the side effects sooner than they were discovered. In a failure~to-warn action by Jim against DEF, the court should direct a verdict in favor of the defendant. 3. The same facts as Illustration 2, except that two years before Jim began talcing X, medical researchers published a credible study in a leading medical journal concerning the possibility that a drug with toxicological effects very similar to X adversely affects vision in adolescents. After publication of the study suggesting a possible link between X and loss of vision in adolescents, DEF did not conduct further research or provide warnings to physicians of the risk of X causing loss of vision. Jim's expe1i witness testifies that a reasonable manufacturer would have tested further and that such testing would have revealed that X causes vision loss in time to have warned Jim's physician. In Jim's failure-to-warn action against DEF, the trial corn1 should submit the issue of DEF's failure to warn to the trier of fact on appropriate instructions. h. Liability of retail seller of prescription drugs and medical devices for defective designs and defects due to inadequate instructions or warnings. The rule governing most products imposes liability on wholesalers and retailers for selling a defectively designed product, or one without adequate instructions or warnings, even though they have exercised reasonable care in marketing the product. See § I, Comment e, and § 2, Comment o. Courts have refused to apply this general rule to nonmanufacturing retail sellers of prescription chugs and medical devices and, instead, have adopted the rule stated in Subsection ( e ). That rule subjects retailers to liability only if the product contains a manufacturing defect or if the retailer fails to exercise reasonable care in connection with distribution of the drug or medical device. In so limiting the liability of intermediary parties, courts have held that they should be permitted to rely on the special expertise of manufacturers, prescribing and treating health care providers, and governmental regulatory agencies. They have also emphasized the needs of medical patients to have ready access to prescription drugs at reasonable prices. WFSTI.AW © 2021 Thomson Reuters.

ABC Pharmaceuticals manufactures and distributes a prescription dmg to reduce blood pressure. ABC supplies pharmacies with pamphlets explaining the risks and warning patients against drinking alcohol while taking the drug. ABC asks the pharmacies to give the pamphlets to patients when dispensing the drug. The P Pharmacy received the pamphlets but negligently failed to give them to patients. P is subject to liability to those patients suffering injury for whom the pamphlets would have been effective in avoiding risks of usage. Reporters' Note Comment b. Rationale. Courts have advanced a number of reasons for exclusive reliance on the learned intermediary rule. See, e.g., West v. Searle & Co., 806 S.W.2d 608, 613-14 (Ark.1991) (provider is best assessor ofrelevant risks and benefits); Brown v. Superior Court, 751 P.2d 470, 478-79 (Cal.1988) (concern that increased liability would drive prices of drugs too high and make them less available); Lacy v. G.D.Searle & Co., 567 A.2d 398 (Del.1989); In re Certified Questions, 358 N.W.2d 873, 883 (Mich.1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting) (in some cases, directly warning patient "could potentially cause undue interference with the doctor-patient relationship [and] cause patient confusion"); Niemiera v. Schneider, 555 A.2d 1112, 1118 n. 3 (N.J.1989) ("The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates vaccine manufacturers .... The regulations are quite detailed in their setting of standards for safety, effectiveness and adequate labelling."); Gravis v. Parke-Davis & Co., 502 S.W.2d 863, 870 (Tex.App.1973) ("[The] entire system of drug distribution in America is set up so as to place the responsibility ... upon professional people"). For a useful discussion of the rule and its underlying rationale, see T.Schwartz, Consumer-Directed Prescription Drug Advertising and the Learned Intermediary Rule, 46 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 829, 830-31 (1991). Comment c. Manufacturers' liability for manzifacturing de/eels.Prescription drug manufacturers are strictly liable for harm caused by manufacturing defects. See, e.g., Merck & Co. v. Kidd, 242 F.2d 592 (6th Cir.) (applying Tennessee law), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 814, 78 S.Ct. 15, 2 L.Ed. 2d 31 (1957); Abbott Labs. v. Lapp, 78 F.2d 170 (7th Cir.1935); Hruska v. Parke, Davis & Co., 6 F.2d 536 (8th Cir.1925); Randall v. Goodrich-Gamble Co., 70 N.W.2d 261 (Minn.1955). Comment k to§ 402A of the Restatement, Second, of Torts reflects this rule: "The seller of [prescription drugs], with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use" (emphasis added). See generally Madden, Products Liability§ 23.3 (2d ed. 1988). Prescription drug retailers also are strictly liable for manufacturing defects. See, e.g., Tremblay v. Kimball, 77 A. 405 (Me.1910); Burgess v. Sims Drug Co., 86 N.W. 307 (Iowa 1901). Comment d Manufacturers' liability for failure adequately to instruct or warn prescribing and other health-care providers. The traditional rule, often referred to as the "learned intermediary rule," holds that manufacturers of prescription drugs discharge their duty of care to patients by warning the health-care providers who prescribe and use the drugs to treat them. See, e.g., DeLuryea v. Winthrop Labs., 697 F.2d 222, 228-29 (8th Cir.1983); Werner v. Upjohn Co., 628 F.2d 848,858 (4th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 862, 66 L.Ed. 2d 804 (1981); Lindsay v. Ortho Phann. Corp., 637 F.2d 87, 91 (2d Cir.1980) (applying New York law). Accord, Salmon v. Parke, Davis & Co., 520 F.2d 1359, 1362 (4th Cir.1975) ("A manufacturer of an ethical drug must exercise reasonable care ... to warn physicians effectively of the drug's inherent dangers."); Basko v. Sterling Drug, Inc., 416 F.2d 417, 426 (2d Cir.1969) (applying Connecticut law) (The manufacturer of a dangerous commodity does have a duty to warn, but when the connnodity is a prescription drug, that duty to warn is fulfilled by fill adequate warning given to those members WESTLAW © 2021 Thomson Reuters. l~o clairn to original U.S.Government Works. 6 CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE I hereby certify that on the 27th day of December, 2021, I electronically filed with the Clerk of the Court using the Washington State Appellate Courts Portal and also served via email the foregoing document to the following: Dearinger (Acting Pro Se): David J.Dearinger 10218 38th Pl.
