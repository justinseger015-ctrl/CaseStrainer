In March2020, he issued a proclamation placing a temporarymoratorium on most evictions. The moratorium was amendedand extended by several subsequent proclamations until thelast version expired on June 30, 2021. The governor thenissued an eviction bridge proclamation, which expired onOctober 31, 2021.Gonzales and Horwath provided rental housing in LewisCounty, and their tenants had not paid rent since thegovernor's proclamation was issued. The appellants filedthis action in Lewis County, seeking a declaration thatthe governor had no statutory authority to issue theeviction moratorium and the moratorium violated severalconstitutional provisions. The State then filed a motion totransfer venue to Thurston County, which the Lewis Countytrial court granted.BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 29,2020 Governor Inslee declared a state of emergency inWashington. On March 18, 2020, the governor issuedProclamation 20-19, 1 which prohibited certain activitiesrelated to residential evictions under the authority ofRCW 43.06.220(1)(h). The effect was to put a temporarymoratorium on most residential evictions. The moratoriumaimed to protect those with the inability to pay rent from beingevicted from their homes in the midst of the pandemic. Thepurpose of the moratorium was to prevent increasing risks tolife, health, and safety from the pandemic.issued subsequent proclamations thatThe governor extended times andthe eviction moratorium several provided much more detailed provisions: Proclamations20-19.1 2 , 20-19.2 3 , 20-19.3 4 , 20-19.4 5 , and 20-19.5. 6The final proclamation regarding the eviction moratorium,Proclamation 20-19.6 7 , expired on June 30, 2021 andwas not renewed. These proclamations prohibited landlordsand related persons from engaging in a number ofactivities regarding evictions, which essentially preventedmost evictions. One exception was if eviction was necessarybecause the tenant was creating a “significant and immediaterisk to the health or safety of others.” Proclamation 20-19.1 atWESTLAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S.Government Works.1GENE GONZALES and SUSAN GONZALES, HORWATH..., --- P.3d ---- (2022)2022 WL 5345523. An exception later was added for when the landlord plannedto personally occupy or sell the rented premises.*2 The proclamations also prohibited landlords fromtreating unpaid rent resulting from COVID-19 as anenforceable debt, unless the landlord offered and the tenantrefused a reasonable repayment plan.In April 2021, the legislature enacted Engrossed SecondSubstitute Senate Bill (E2SSB) 5160. LAWS of 2021, ch.115.Section 1 of E2SSB 5160 noted the governor's temporarymoratorium on evictions “to reduce housing instability andenable tenants to stay in their homes.” LAWS of 2021,ch. 115, sec. 1. E2SSB stated that the Governor's evictionmoratorium would end on June 30, 2021. RCW 59.18.630.E2SSB 5160 provided a number of protections for tenants,including that landlords must offer tenants a reasonableschedule for repayment of unpaid rent accruing betweenMarch 1, 2020 and six months after expiration of the evictionmoratorium. RCW 59.18.630. In addition, the legislationprovided for the development of court-based eviction pilotprograms to facilitate the resolution of nonpayment of rentcases between landlords and tenants. LAWS OF 2021, ch.115, sec. 7. E2SSB 5160 also allowed landlords to recover upto $15,000 from the State in unpaid rent if the tenant voluntaryvacated a tenancy or if a tenant defaulted on a paymentplan. RCW 43.31.605 (1)(d)(i). And it was required thatlandlords be given the opportunity to apply for certain rentalassistance programs. LAWS OF 2021, ch. 115, sec. 12.On June 29, 2021, the governor issued Proclamation21-09 8 as a temporary bridge between the expired evictionmoratorium and the implementation of E2SSB 5160. Thisproclamation continued to prohibit evictions until certainprovisions of E2SSB 5160 were implemented. Proclamation21-09 was extended once, Proclamation 21-09.1 9 , andexpired on October 31, 2021.Lawsuit and Summary JudgmentGonzales and Horwath provided rental housing in LewisCounty. Tenant X had been with the Gonzales’ since 2019.Tenant X had not paid rent or utilities since June 2020. TheGonzales’ asked tenant X if they planned to pay utilities andtenant X reportedly responded with “[w]hy should I pay themanything; they can't shut me off due to the Pandemic.” CP at252.Tenant Y rented with Horwath. Tenant Y had not paid rentsince February 2020 or utilities since March 2020. A rentalmanagement company attempted to contact tenant Y aboutfinding a solution for paying and to inquire about tenantY's plans or ability to pay. Tenant Y did not respond to theinquiries. No repayment plan was offered because tenant Ywould not respond to any communications.In December 2020, Gonzales and Horwath, joined bythe Washington Landlord Association, filed a declaratoryjudgment action in Lewis County against Governor Inslee andthe State. They sought an order declaring that the governor'sproclamations ordering an eviction moratorium were voidas being without statutory authority and unconstitutionalunder various provisions, and an order declaring that theproclamations had caused an unconstitutional taking withoutcompensation.*3 The State filed a motion to change venue from LewisCounty to Thurston County. The Lewis County trial courtRCW 4.12.020(2) because thegranted the motion under case involved a lawsuit against a public officer for an act doneby the governor in virtue of his office.Both parties subsequently filed summary judgment motions.The parties submitted declarations supporting the facts statedabove.

I standready to partner with our legislatorsas necessary and appropriate to ensurethat the needed framework is passedinto law.*5 Proclamation 20-19.3 at 7 (emphasis omitted).C.MOOTNESS OF APPEALThe State argues that the issue is moot because themoratorium has expired. The appellants argue that even if thecase is moot, it should be resolved because there are mattersof substantial public interest. We agree with the appellants.An appeal is moot if we no longer can provide effective relief.Dzaman v. Gowman, 18 Wn. App. 2d 469, 476, 491 P.3d1012 (2021). However, we may exercise our discretion toreview a moot appeal when it involves issues of continuingand substantial public interest. Id. Three factors determinewhether we will exercise our discretion: “ ‘(1) the public orprivate nature of the question presented, (2) the desirabilityof an authoritative determination to provide future guidanceto public officers, and (3) the likelihood that the question willrecur.’ ” Id. (quoting Thomas v. Lehman, 138 Wn. App. 618,622, 158 P.3d 86 (2007)).WESTLAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S.Government Works.4GENE GONZALES and SUSAN GONZALES, HORWATH..., --- P.3d ---- (2022)2022 WL 534552These three factors support considering this appeal. At firstglance, this appeal appears to be moot because the evictionmoratorium expired in June 2021 and the bridge moratoriumexpired in October 2021. But the COVID-19 pandemic is notover. And because the pandemic persists, it is possible that thegovernor may institute another, similar eviction moratoriumin the future. Therefore, this case presents issues of continuingand substantial public interest.D.CHANGE OF VENUEThe appellants argue that the Lewis County trial courtimproperly transferred venue to Thurston County. Wedisagree.The venue of an action is determined by statute. Clark Countyv. Portland Vancouver Junction R.R., LLC, 17 Wn. App. 2d289, 292, 485 P.3d 985 (2021). When two different venuestatutes apply to a lawsuit, we will apply “ ‘mandatory statutesto the exclusion of permissive ones and specific statutes tothe exclusion of general ones.’ ” Id. at 293 (quoting Ralphv. Weyerhaeuser Co., 187 Wn.2d 326, 338, 386 P.3d 721(2016)).RCW 4.12.010(1) states that venue shall be in the countywhere the subject of the action is located “for any injuries toreal property.” RCW 4.92.010 states that the venue of lawsuitsagainst the State shall be in one of several places, includingthe county of the residence of one or more plaintiffs and “[t]hecounty in which the real property that is the subject of theaction is situated.” The appellants rely on these statutes toargue that venue was proper in Lewis County, where theyresided and where their rental properties were located.However, RCW 4.12.020(2) states that for actions “againsta public officer ... for an act done by him or her in virtue ofhis or her office,” venue shall be “in the county where thecause of action, or some part thereof, arose.” The State relieson this statute to argue that venue was proper only in ThurstonCounty, where the governor issued the proclamations.The Supreme Court has stated that when RCW 4.12.020(2)applies, “venue in the specified county is mandatory.”Johnson v. Inslee, 198 Wn.2d 492, 496, 496 P.3d 1191(2021). Therefore, the only question here is whether RCW4.12.020(2) applies to this action.*6 The Supreme Court's decision in Johnson resolves thisissue. In that case, a State employee filed a lawsuit againstGovernor Inslee and other State entities in Franklin County,challenging the governor's proclamation requiring all Stateemployees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 198 Wn.2dat 494-95.Regarding where the cause of action arose, the court relied oncases from other states to conclude that “it is the official actitself – the act for which redress is sought – that ’gives rise’to the cause of action, and thus venue is proper in the countywhere the act is made.” Id. at 496-97. Therefore, the court heldthat the cause of action regarding the governor's proclamationarose only in Thurston County, where he performed the actof issuing it. Id. at 498-99. The court stated, “To concludeotherwise would mean a statewide public official such as thegovernor could be haled into superior courts throughout thestate to defend similar suits challenging a single act havingstatewide effect, as this case itself exemplifies.” Id. at 497.Regarding the “in virtue of office” requirement, the courtstated, “[R]egardless of whether the governor exceeded hisconstitutional authority, which has not yet been determined,he plainly acted ‘in virtue of his ... office’ in issuingemergency proclamations pursuant to his statutory authorityunder RCW 43.06.220.” Id. at 498. The court concluded,“The governor issued his proclamations ‘in virtue’ of his‘office’ within the meaning of RCW 4.12.020(2).” Id.Based on this analysis, the court held that Thurston Countywas the mandatory venue for the action challenging thegovernor's vaccine proclamation. Id. at 498-99.The appellants argue that Johnson is distinguishable becausethat case did not involve real property. They claim thatRCW 4.12.020(2) cannot trump RCW 4.12.010(1) andRCW 4.92.010. But the court in Johnson expressly stated thatRCW 4.12.020(2) is mandatory if that statute applies. 198Wn.2d at 496. Therefore, it does trump other venue statutes.See Portland Vancouver Junction R.R, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 293.The appellants also argue under RCW 4.12.020 that “somepart” of their cause of action arose in Lewis County becausetheir injuries occurred in Lewis County. But the same wastrue in Johnson, and the court in that case rejected a similarargument. 198 Wn.2d at 497 n.6. The court expressly heldthat the “cause of action challenging the lawfulness of theWESTLAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters.

We disagree.1. Legal Principles“The executive branch has historically led Washington'sresponse to emergencies.” Colvin v. Inslee, 195 Wn.2d879, 895, 467 P.3d 953 (2020). RCW 43.06.010(12) states,“The governor may, after finding that a public disorder,disaster, energy emergency, or riot exists within this stateor any part thereof which affects life, health, property, orthe public peace, proclaim a state of emergency in the areaaffected.” A declaration of a state of emergency activatesthe governor's broad powers in emergencies. Colvin, 195Wn.2d at 895. Various statutes “evidence a clear intent by thelegislature to delegate requisite police power to the governorin times of emergency. The necessity for such delegation isreadily apparent.” Cougar Bus. Owners’ Assoc. v. State,97 Wn.2d 466, 474, 647 P.2d 481 (1982), overruled in partby Chong 694 (2019).Yim v. City of Seattle, 194 Wn.2d 682, 451 P.3d*7RCW 43.06.220(1) provides:The governor after proclaiming a state of emergency andprior to terminating such, may, in the area described by theproclamation issue an order prohibiting:....(h) Such other activities as he or she reasonably believesshould be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life,health, property or the public peace.(Emphasis added.)“The governor RCW 43.06.220(2) afterstates, proclaiming a state of emergency and prior to terminatingsuch may, in the area described by the proclamation, issue anorder or orders concerning waiver or suspension of statutoryobligations or limitations” in certain specified areas. A waiveror suspension of statutory obligations or limitations undersubsection (2) may not continue for longer than 30 days unlessextended by the legislature. RCW 43.06.220(4).We review de novo issues of statutory interpretation.Wright v. Lyft, Inc., 189 Wn.2d 718, 722, 406 P.3d 1149(2017). The goal in interpreting a statute is to determine andgive effect to the legislature's intent. Id. The court considersthe language of the statute, the context of the statute, relatedGray v.statutes, and the statutory scheme as a whole. Suttell & Assocs., 181 Wn.2d 329, 339, 334 P.3d 14 (2014).The interpretation ends if the plain language is unambiguous.Jametsky v. Olsen, 179 Wn.2d 756, 762, 317 P.3d 1003(2014). But if more than one reasonable interpretation exists,the court will resolve it by turning to other sources oflegislative intent, including statutory construction, legislativehistory, and case law. Id.2. AnalysisRCW 43.06.220(1)(h) isHere, the plain language of unambiguous. The governor may issue an order prohibitingany activities the governor reasonably believes should beprohibited “to help preserve and maintain life, health,property or the public peace.” RCW 43.06.220(1)(h). Theterm “activities” is extremely broad, and is broad enough toinclude the actions the proclamations prohibited regardingevictions and unpaid rent. And the proclamation preamblesmade it clear that the governor reasonably believed thatprohibiting those activities was necessary to preserve life,health, and property.The appellants argue that the proclamations suspended rightsand obligations established by various statutes, includingthe obligation of tenants to pay rent and the right oflandlords to evict tenants who do not pay rent. Theyemphasize that RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) does not authorizethe governor to suspend the operation of statutes. And theyt claim that if RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) is interpreted to allowthe suspension of statutes, subsection (2) – which doesWESTlAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S.Government Works.6GENE GONZALES and SUSAN GONZALES, HORWATH..., --- P.3d ---- (2022)2022 WL 534552expressly authorize the suspension of statutory obligations orlimitations in certain areas – would be rendered superfluous.governor prohibited certain specific activities as 43.06.220(1)(h) expressly authorized.RCWHowever, none of the proclamations stated that the governorwas suspending any statutes. Tenants still were subject to thestatutory obligation to pay rent set forth in RCW 59.18.110;they simply could not be evicted for failing to pay rent.The moratorium may have delayed the ability of landlordsto exercise the statutory remedy of eviction stated in RCW59.12.030 in many cases, but the operation of that statutewas not suspended. The wrongful detainer statute still couldbe invoked if “necessary to respond to a significant andimmediate risk to the health and safety of others created by theresident,” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 3, or if the property ownerplanned to personally occupy or sell the rental property.*8 Instead of suspending any statutes, the governorprohibited certain specific activities, as RCW43.06.220(1)(h) expressly authorized. Nothing in RCW43.06.220(1)(h) suggests that the governor is not authorizedto prohibit activities that may involve statutory rights andobligations.f· We hold that RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) authorized thegovernor to issue the proclamations providing for an evictionmoratorium. 10F.DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITYissuance of an eviction moratorium, Appellants argue that if RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) authorizedthe it violatedthe constitutional prohibition of delegation of legislativeauthority. We disagree.Article 2, section 1 (amendment 72) of the WashingtonConstitution states that “[t]he legislative authority of the stateof Washington shall be vested in the legislature.” As a result,the legislature cannot delegate purely legislative functions toother branches of government. Auto. United Trades Org.v. State, 183 Wn.2d 842, 859, 357 P.3d 615 (2015). “Thesenondelegable powers include the power to enact, suspend,and repeal laws.” Diversified Inv. P'ship v. Dep't of Soc. &Health Servs., 113 Wn.2d 19, 24, 775 P.2d 947 (1989).f 1 RCW 43.06.220(1)(h) did not violateWe hold that the constitutional prohibition of delegation of legislativeauthority.G.SEPARATION OF POWERS AND DENIAL OFACCESS TO COURTSAppellants argue thethat separation of powers doctrine and denied them access to thecourts for judicial relief. We disagree.the proclamations violated 1. Separation of PowersThe Washington Constitution does not contain a formalseparation of powers clause, but “ ‘the very division ofour government into different branches has been presumedthroughout our state's history to give rise to a vital separationof powers doctrine.’ ” Brown v. Owen, 165 Wn.2d 706,718, 206 P.3d 310 (2009) (quoting Carrick v. Locke,125 Wn.2d 129, 135, 882 P.2d 173 (1994)). The doctrineensures “that the fundamental functions of each branchremain inviolate.” Hale v. Wellpinit Sch. Dist. No. 49, 165Wn.2d 494, 504, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). A branch violatesthe separation of powers doctrine when an action “threatensthe independence or integrity or invades the prerogatives ofanother.” City of Fircrest v. Jensen, 158 Wn.2d 384, 394,143 P.3d 776 (2006).Here, the proclamations do not interfere with a court'sauthority in any way. None of the proclamation provisions aredirected to the courts, and the proclamations do not purportto prevent the courts from taking any actions. For example,the proclamations do not prohibit courts from issuing evictionorders or otherwise resolving disputes between landlords andtenants. Instead, the proclamations’ prohibitions are directedat landlords and related persons. Preventing a person fromrequesting or enforcing eviction orders does not invade theprerogatives of the judicial branch. Therefore, we hold thatthe proclamations did not violate the separation of powersdoctrine.As noted above, none of the proclamations stated that thegovernor was suspending any statutes. And the proclamationsdid not suspend the operation of any statutes. Instead, the2. Access to CourtsWESTLAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters.

Barrett, 115 Wn.2d 556,562, 800 P.2d 367 (1990).b. AnalysisBecause the proclamations regulated but did not completelydeny access to the courts, we analyze the appellants’access to courts claim under a rational basis approach. SeeGiordano, 57 Wn. App. at 77. Under this approach,the question is whether the eviction moratorium “rationallyserves a legitimate end.” Id.The State's purpose in preventing the spread and transmissionof COVID-19 undoubtedly is significant and important. See,Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo,e.g., ___ U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 63, 67, 208 L.Ed. 2d 206(2020) (stating that “[s]temming the spread of COVID-19is unquestionably a compelling interest.”). So is preventingwidespread homelessness caused by economic distressrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.In addition, the eviction moratorium was a rational meansto achieve this important purpose. As the governor notedin his proclamations, the COVID-19 pandemic was causingadverse economic consequences for a large number of people,potentially resulting in a widespread inability to pay rentand evictions. Evictions would increase the health and safetyrisks from the pandemic for people forced into homelessness.Conversely, a moratorium on evictions would allow people tostay in their homes, thereby promoting health and safety andhelping to prevent the progression of the pandemic.*10 Several federal cases have rejected access to courtschallenges to restrictions on evictions related to COVID-19.Heights Apts., LLC v. Walz, 510 F.Supp. 3d 789, 810-11(D.Minn. 2020), appeal filed, No. 21-1278 (8th Cir. Feb.5, 2021); Baptiste v. Kennealy, 490 F.Supp. 3d 353,Elmsford Apt. Assocs., LLC v.393-96 (D.Mass. 2020); Cuomo, 469 F.Supp. 3d 148, 174-75 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), appealdismissed, 860 F.App'x 215 (2d Cir. 2021).Here, the governor's proclamations did not completely restrictaccess to the courts. There were exceptions to the evictionmoratorium if the tenant created health and safety risksto others, and if the property owner planned to personallyoccupy or sell the rental property. Landlords could treatunpaid rent as an enforceable obligation and could sue onthat obligation if the tenant refused or failed to comply with areasonable repayment plan. And a landlord's ability to bringeviction proceedings only was delayed until the expiration ofthe final proclamation, not extinguished completely.The appellants rely on a trial court decision from the Districtof Columbia in which the court ruled that an evictionmoratorium violated the constitutional right to access usingan intermediate scrutiny analysis. However, the D.C.Court ofAppeals reversed this decision and held that the moratoriumdid not violate the right to access. Dist. of Columbia v. Towers,260 A.3d 690, 693-96 (D.C.App. 2021).We hold that the eviction moratorium did not violate theappellants’ right of access to the courts.WESTLAW © 2022 Thomson Reuters.

We disagree. 111. Legal PrinciplesThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitutionstates that private property shall not be “taken for publicuse, without just compensation.” Article I, section 16 of theWashington Constitution provides, “No private property shallbe taken or damaged for public or private use without justcompensation having been first made.” Washington courtsgenerally apply the federal takings analysis. See Chong Yim,194 Wn.2d at 658-59.There are two general types of takings: (1) a physical taking,where “the government authorizes a physical occupation ofproperty”; and (2) a regulatory taking, “where the governmentYee v. City ofmerely regulates the use of property.” Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, 522 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed. 2d 153 (1992). The first type is subject to a per serule: if a physical taking has occurred, the government mustpay compensation. Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, ___U.S. ___, 141 S.Ct. 2063, 2071, 210 L.Ed. 2d 369 (2021).“Whenever a regulation results in a physical appropriationof property, a per se taking has occurred.” Id. at 2072. Inaddition, “a physical appropriation is a taking whether it ispermanent or temporary.” Id. at 2074.The second type of taking is analyzed using a flexible,balancing test adopted in Penn Central Transportation Co.v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed. 2d 631 (1978). Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S.Ct. at 2072.The appellants allege only that the temporary evictionmoratorium constituted a physical, per se taking. They do notargue that the moratorium was a regulatory taking under PennCentral.2. Analysis*11 The appellants argue that the eviction moratoriumconstituted a physical, per se taking because it requiredthem to allow tenants to reside in their property without thepayment of rent. Relying on Cedar Point Nursery, they claimthat precluding evictions essentially forced them to submit toa physical occupation of their property.This argument is inconsistent with the United States SupremeCourt's analysis in Yee. In that case, mobile park owners whorented pads to the owners of mobile homes challenged a statestatute that among other things (1) limited their ability toterminate a mobile home owner's tenancy, (2) did not allowthem to remove a mobile home if it was sold, and (3) requiredthem to continue renting to a mobile home purchaser as longas the purchaser had the ability to pay rent. Yee, 503U.S. at 524. The City of Escondido subsequently adopteda rent control ordinance that dictated the rent the mobileId. at 524-25. The mobile parkpark owners could charge. owners argued that the statute and ordinance resulted in aphysical, per se taking because they were precluded from fullyusing and occupying their property. Id. at 525. Instead, theright to physically occupy their property – at submarket rent– essentially had been transferred indefinitely to the mobilehome owners and their successors. Id. at 527.The Court stated that this argument was inconsistent withthe law of physical takings. Id. The court stated, “Thegovernment effects a physical taking only where it requiresthe landowner to submit to the physical occupation of hisland. ‘This element of required acquiescence is at the heart ofthe concept of occupation.’ ” Id. (quoting FCC v. FloridaPower Corp., 480 U.S. 245, 252, 107 S.Ct. 1107, 1112, 94 L.Ed. 2d 282 (1987)). However, the Court emphasized thatthe statute and the ordinance had not required the occupationof the mobile park – the mobile park owners had voluntarilyYee, 503rented their property to the mobile home owners. U.S. at 527. “Put bluntly, no government has required anyphysical invasion of petitioners’ property.

Teleprompter ManhattanCATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 440, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed. 2d 868 (1982)).The appellants rely on Cedar Point Nursery. In that case,a labor regulation required agricultural employers to permitunion organizers on their property for three hours a day, 120days per year, for the purpose of soliciting employees tojoin or form a union. Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S.Ct. at2069. The court emphasized that the regulation allowed unionorganizers to physically enter and occupy the property. Id.at 2072. “The regulation appropriates a right to physicallyinvade the growers’ property – to literally ‘take access,’ as theregulation provides.” that the regulation was a per se physical taking. Id.Id. at 2074. Therefore, the court held*12 This case is similar to Yee and is dissimilar to CedarPoint Nursery. As in Yee, the eviction moratorium did notrequire the appellants to submit to the physical occupationof their property. Instead, the appellants were the ones whoinvited their tenants to occupy their rental property. Andunlike in Cedar Point Nursery, the moratorium did not requirethat the appellants allow third parties to enter and takeaccess to their property. The proclamations merely operatedto “regulate [appellants’] use of their land by regulating therelationship between landlord and tenant.” Yee, 503 U.S.at 528. Therefore, we conclude that the eviction moratoriumdid not constitute a physical per se taking.This conclusion is supported by federal courts in Washingtonand in other jurisdictions that have ruled that evictionmoratoriums do not constitute an unconstitutional physicalJevons v.

We disagree.1. Legal StandardArticle I, section 10 of the United States Constitutionstates, “No State shall ... pass any ... law impairingthe obligation of contracts.” Article I, section 23 of theWashington Constitution provides that “[n]o ... law impairingthe obligations of contracts shall ever be passed.” Thestandards under the two provisions are the same. Lenander v.Dept. of Ret. Sys., 186 Wn.2d 393, 414, 377 P.3d 199 (2016).“[A] constitutional violation will be found only if thechallenged action substantially impairs an existing contractand, even then, only if the action was not reasonable andnecessary to serve a legitimate public purpose.” Id. We applya three-part test: “(1) Does a contractual relationship exist;(2) does the legislation substantially impair the relationship;and (3) if there is a substantial impairment, is the impairmentreasonable and necessary to serve a legitimate publicpurpose?” Id.If the government is not one of the contracting parties, ashere, the court must “ ‘defer to legislative judgment as tothe necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.’ ”Energy Reserves Grp., Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co.,459 U.S. 400, 413, 103 S.Ct. 697, 74 L.Ed. 2d 569 (1983)(quoting United States Trust Co. v.

However,denial of means to enforce them.” the Court stated that the constitutional prohibition against theimpairment of contracts should be not be construed to prevent“limited and temporary interpositions with respect to theenforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great publiccalamity,” including urgent public need related to economiccauses. Id. (emphasis added).*13 Regarding the statute at issue, the Court noted thatthe mortgage debt was not impaired, the validity of theforeclosure sale and the mortgagee's ability to obtain adeficiency judgment were not affected, and the mortgagorwas required to pay the rental value of the home duringId. at 445. “The mortgagee-the extended possession. purchaser during the time that he cannot obtain possessionthus is not left without compensation for the withholding ofpossession.” Id. Therefore, the Court held that the statute didnot violate the contracts clause. Id. at 447.2. Analysisa. Substantial ImpairmentTo determine whether there is a substantial impairment ofa contractual relationship, we consider “the extent to whichthe law undermines the contractual bargain, interferes with aparty's reasonable expectations, and prevents the party fromSveen v. Melin,safeguarding or reinstating his rights.” ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 1815, 1822, 201 L.Ed. 2d 180(2018). All three considerations support the conclusion thatthe eviction moratorium does not substantially impair theappellants’ contracts with their tenants.First, the eviction moratorium did not undermine landlords’contractual bargain. The moratorium did not extinguish thecontractual obligations of tenants to pay rent. Instead, themoratorium temporarily delayed landlords’ ability to exercisethe remedy of eviction for nonpayment of rent.The appellants claim that the moratorium imposed apermanent prohibition against landlords treating any unpaidrent as an enforceable debt. However, this claim is inaccurate.The proclamations state that unpaid rent would not be anenforceable debt only if (1) nonpayment occurred afterFebruary 29, 2020, (2) “non-payment was as a result of theCOVID-19 outbreak,” and (3) the landlord failed to offer thetenant a reasonable repayment plan. Proclamation 20-19.1 at4. Assuming a landlord offered a reasonable repayment plan,all unpaid rent would be an enforceable debt.The appellants argue that allowing landlords to treat unpaidrent as an enforceable debt only if they offer a reasonablepayment plan was illusory for landlords, like Horwath,whose tenants refused to communicate with them. Theyemphasize that the repayment plan condition required thatthe offered plan be “reasonable based on the individualfinancial, health, and other circumstances of that resident.”Proclamation 20-19.1 at 4. According to the appellants, itwould be impossible for landlords to offer the requiredrepayment plan if they had no information regarding theirtenants’ “financial, health, and other circumstances” and noway of forcing tenants to provide such information.However, a trial court assessing whether a prepayment planwas reasonable undoubtedly would base its assessment onthe information available to the landlord. For example, thelandlord could make assumptions based on the financialinformation about the tenants obtained at the inception of thelease. A trial court would not penalize a landlord by renderingunpaid rent an unenforceable debt when the landlord madea good faith effort to design a reasonable repayment plandespite the tenant's failure to cooperate.Second, the moratorium did not completely interfere withlandlords’ reasonable expectations. There is no question thatthe rental housing industry generally has been regulatedheavily, such as in the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act,chapter 59.18 RCW, and the forcible entry and unlawfuldetainer statute, chapter 59.12 RCW.This pervasiveregulation put landlords on notice that the government mightintervene further in the landlord-tenant relationship.*14 Third, the eviction moratorium gave landlords theability to safeguard and reinstate their rights. The moratoriumwas temporary, and following its expiration landlordsretained all available remedies for nonpayment of rent. Themoratorium merely delayed the exercise of those remedies.And as noted above, even during the moratorium landlordscould treat unpaid rent as an enforceable obligation if theyoffered tenants a reasonable repayment plan.Federal courts in Washington and in other jurisdictions haveruled that eviction moratoriums do not substantially impaircontractual relationships between landlords and tenants.

Assocs., 469 F.Supp. 3d at 171-72.We conclude substantially impair the appellants’ rental contracts.the eviction moratorium did notthat b. Reasonable and Necessary MeansEven if we were to assume that the eviction moratoriumsubstantially impaired the appellants’ contractual relationshipwith their tenants, the moratorium did not violate the contractsclause because it was “reasonable and necessary to serve alegitimate public purpose.” Lenander, 186 Wn.2d at 414.The appellants do not dispute that the eviction moratoriumserved a legitimate public purpose: to prevent widespreadhomelessness and the further spread of COVID-19. Theyargue only that the moratorium did not advance this purposein an appropriate and reasonable manner. And they focusonly on the fact that the eviction moratorium applied to alltenants, including those who suffered no economic hardshipor inability to pay as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.However, this case does not involve government contracts,so we must defer to the governor's judgment as to thebest way to achieve the compelling government purpose.See Energy Reserves Grp., 459 U.S. at 413. Requiringtenants to prove financial hardship in order to stop evictionproceedings would create further uncertainty and would forcetenants to expend limited personal and financial resources tomaintain their homes. And some tenants may not have theability to gather sufficient evidence to prove an inability topay, and therefore would lose their homes despite sufferingpandemic-related economic distress. Finally, requiring proofof financial hardship potentially would have created the needfor thousands of tenants to appear in court, further riskingexposure to and spread of COVID-19.In addition, the governor's proclamations required tenantsto pay rent if they had the financial resources to pay.Proclamation 20-19.1 and all subsequent proclamationscontained the statement that “Tenants, residents, and renterswho are not materially affected by COVID-19 shouldand must continue to pay rent, to avoid unnecessary andavoidable economic hardship to landlords, property owners,and property managers who are economically impacted by theCOVID-19 pandemic.” Proclamation 20-19.1 at 2.We conclude that the temporary eviction moratorium wasreasonable and necessary to serve the legitimate publicpurpose of preventing homelessness and the spread ofCOVID-19.Accordingly, we hold that the eviction moratorium didnot unconstitutionally impair the appellants’ contractualrelationship with their tenants.CONCLUSIONWe affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favorof the State.We concur:WORSWICK, P.J.HULL, J.P.T. *All Citations--- P.3d ----, 2022 WL 534552Footnotes*12Governor of 2020), Judge Kevin Hull is serving as a judge pro tempore of the court pursuant to RCW 2.06.150(1).Proclamation 18, %20COVID19%20Moratorium%20on%20Evictions%20%28tmp%29.pdf [https://perma.cc/BBN9-QEM8].Proclamation 16, Apr.https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-19.1%20-Marchhttps://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-19%20-of 2020), Governor 20-19.1 (Wash.

July The State argues that even if the proclamations exceeded the governor's authority under RCW43.06.220(1)(h), the legislature's enactment of E2SSB 5160 ratified the governor's reliance on that statuteto issue the eviction moratorium. Because we hold that the governor did have authority, we do not addressthis issue.There is some question whether the appellants are entitled to an equitable remedy – a declaratory judgment– on their takings claim. The remedy for a government taking is compensation through a damages award,but the appellants’ complaint does not request damages. However, the State does not argue that we shoulddecline to address the takings claim, and therefore we do not address this issue.The appellants also briefly argue that the eviction moratorium took the rental income to which they wereentitled. But it is undisputed that the moratorium did not eliminate the appellants’ ability to collect the fullamount of past rent due, as long as they offered a reasonable repayment plan to their tenants.End of Document© 2022 Thomson Reuters.
