Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 339-45, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed. 2d 799 (1963); State v. Jackson, 66 Wn.2d 24, 28, 400 P.2d 774 (1965). All parties to this action agree, as they must, that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst were entitled to representation by a person authorized by this Court to practice law. City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 217, 667 P.2d 630 (1983). They never waived that right, but the Asotin County Superior Court chose to assign Robert Van Idour to their cases. Unknown to either Mr. Lewis or Mr. Ayerst until long after their convictions, Mr. Van Idour was at no point authorized to practice law in Washington. These cases therefore begin with the premise that Lewis and Ayerst were both denied their right to counsel. The meaning 1 and construction of neither the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor of article I, section § 22 of the Washington Constitution are at issue. The sole question before the court, rather, is whether the denial of the right to counsel invalidates the convictions entered by the Asotin County Superior Court. There can be only one answer to that question, and this Court provided it almost 40 years ago: the absolute denial of the right to counsel by appointing a person not authorized to practice law in this state invalidates the criminal conviction. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. II.INTEREST OF AMICUS This brief is filed on behalf of the Washington State Office of Public Defense. The Office of Public Defense is an independent judicial branch agency with a statutory duty to “implement the constitutional and statutory guarantees of counsel and to ensure effective and efficient delivery of indigent defense services funded by the state of Washington[.]” RCW 2.70.005. 2 This case raises the question of whether a client who was denied the representation of counsel duly authorized to practice law in Washington is entitled to relief from personal restraint on that basis. The Office of Public Defense has a systemic role in implementing the constitutional and statutory right to counsel in Washington. While the Office of Public Defense does not have direct supervisory authority over trial-level public defense in criminal cases, the agency has an ongoing role providing training and technical assistance to both public defense systems and to administrators of public defense systems at the county and municipal levels. III.ISSUE ADDRESSED BY AMICUS Does the assignment as a public defender of an out-of-state attorney who is not admitted to practice in Washington constitute a complete denial of the constitutional right to counsel, invalidating an indigent defendant’s felony conviction? 3 IV.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Office of Public Defense adopts the statements of the case offered by the parties and by the Court of Appeals in the decisions below. See In re Pers. Restraint Petition of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d 356, 358-59, 486 P.3d 943 (2021); In re Pers. Restraint Petition of Lewis, No. 37284-7-III, 2021 WL 1750935, slip. op. at 1 (Wash. Ct. App. May 4, 2021) (unpublished).1 V.ARGUMENT A.Washington’s Rules Governing the Practice of Law Determine the Outcome of This Case Legal analysis must begin in the right place in order to reach the right result. It is undisputed that the attorney who represented Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst was at no point authorized to practice law in Washington. The question presented is whether 1 Cited as procedural history to this case. Although citable as persuasive authority pursuant to CR 14.1, the opinion has no precedential value, is not binding on any court, and is cited only as one of the decisions reviewed in this consolidated appeal. The reasoning employed by the Court of Appeals in the two cases under review is essentially the same, and so further citations reference only the published opinion in In re PRP of Ayerst. 4 this denial of their right to counsel results in the invalidation of their convictions. The State’s supplemental brief thus asks and answers the wrong question. The State begins from the premise that the Washington Constitution provides the same protections as the federal constitution as to the right to counsel. Supplemental Brief of the State of Washington (State Br.) at 2. But it cannot be denied that the right to counsel entails the right to representation by a person duly authorized to practice law in this state. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219-20; see also id. at 221 (focusing on whether the defendant was provided with an advocate who has attained “status as counsel,” which is based on compliance with the Admission to Practice Rules). The State agrees. State Br. at 11. Where the scope of the right is the same under state and federal law, federal cases may guide this Court’s application of that law. See, e.g., Yim v. City of Seattle, 194 Wn.2d 651, 658-59, 451 P.3d 675 (2019) (equating in substance the right against an 5 unconstitutional taking of property under federal and state law). But that does not mean that federal cases control the outcome of related but different issues of state law. The question here is not whether federal jurisprudence would excuse what happened here had the cases been in federal court; the question is whether this Court, as the body entrusted with oversight of the practice of law, will do so. Const. art. IV, § 1. This is a question of the remedy, not of the right. The State, like the Court of Appeals, relies on federal authority for the proposition that so long as the person appointed to serve as counsel was admitted to the practice of law somewhere, the remedy for their appointment here does not include invalidation of the conviction absent a showing of prejudice. State Br. at 13-17; In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. at 360-62. This reliance on federal authority fails at the outset because this Court, not the federal courts, “determines who may or may not appear before the bar.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215 (citing Const. art. IV, § 1). The role of this Court to oversee the 6 practice of law thus provides an independent and adequate state ground for invalidating the convictions of Mr. Lewis and Ayerst that goes unaddressed by the State or the court below. Beyond dispute, Mr. Van Idour was not authorized by this Court to practice law in Washington. In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 359. The legal consequence of that failure to comply with Washington law therefore turns upon Washington law and not upon federal law defining the scope of the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. This court should reject the State’s invitation to rely on federal case law and decide this case under Washington precedent, which unambiguously requires reversal of Mr. Ayerst and Lewis’s convictions. B.Representation by an Out of State Attorney Requires Reversal Without a Showing of Prejudice The Court of Appeals recognized that the uncontroverted facts concerning Mr. Van Idour’s appointment demonstrated a complete deprivation of the right to counsel. In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 360 (noting that Mr. Ayerst did not have 7 “counsel” as that term is defined for constitutional purposes). The court below erred, however, when it failed to follow this Court’s precedent as to the remedy for a failure to appoint counsel who was legally authorized to practice in Washington. The lower court should have followed the rule this Court established in Ratliff: The appointment of a non-Washington lawyer constitutes a complete denial of counsel unless that person fully complies with the APRs. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. The Ratliff case is analogous to those of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst, and required that their personal restraint petitions be granted. There, this Court found a complete denial of the right to counsel where the trial judge effectively precluded a Rule 9 intern from complying with the requirements of Admission to Practice Rule (APR) 9. Id. at 220. Contrary to APR 9, the intern was working without the supervision of a licensed attorney with at least three years of experience. Id. at 218-21. This Court consequently held that representation by the intern was a total deprivation of the right to counsel: “[a]lthough one who is 8 authorized to practice only under certain conditions . . . may be considered ‘counsel’ for constitutional purposes, this is so only when he or she complies with those conditions.” Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 218. This Court accordingly reversed Mr. Ratliff’s conviction, despite there being nothing in the record to suggest the intern provided sub-par representation. See id. at 221. Here, Mr. Van Idour was an Idaho attorney without a license to practice Washington, whose practice in Washington was therefore unauthorized. APR 8(c) permits attorneys licensed out of state to represent indigent clients “while rendering service in either a bar association or governmentally sponsored legal services organization or in a public defender’s office or similar program providing legal services to indigents[.]” Such attorneys may, “upon application and approval,” practice law in Washington. APR 8(c) (emphasis added). This authorization is conditioned on the attorney associating with an active member of the Bar in Washington, who “shall be the lawyer of record and responsible for the conduct of the matter[.]” APR 8(c)(2). There 9 is no evidence in this case Mr. Van Idour was part of any sort of organization responsible for providing public defense services; he was practicing as an independent contractor. And no licensed Washington attorney served as counsel of record as APR 8(c) required. It is thus undisputed that Mr. Van Idour was practicing in violation of APR 8. While Mr. Van Idour violated APR 8 rather than APR 9, he was just as unauthorized to practice in Washington as the intern in Ratliff. In fact, Mr. Van Idour’s conduct was more egregious than that of the intern in Ratliff. The intern in Ratliff represented the defendant under protest, Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 214, while Mr. Van Idour accepted an indigent defense contract from Asotin County Superior Court in full knowledge that he was not admitted to practice in Washington. Thus, while the specific APR rule at issue might have differed from Ratliff, the total deprivation of counsel was the same, and the culpability 10 of the unauthorized attorney was greater. The Court of Appeals should have applied Ratliff and granted Mr. Ayerst and Mr. Lewis’s personal restraint petitions. To escape this result, the Court of Appeals attempted to distinguish Ratliff based on Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 1983), even though the Ratliff court never cited Solina. In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 360. Solina held that dismissal without a showing of prejudice is required when an unauthorized attorney represents a defendant because the unauthorized practice of law creates a conflict of interest between the attorney and client. Solina, 709 F. 2d at 164. The conflict of interest arises because the unauthorized practitioner, who is committing a crime by practicing without authorization, “cannot be wholly free from fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should lead the prosecutor or the trial judge to inquire into his background and discover his lack of credentials.” Id. Relying on Solina, the Court of Appeals held that Mr. Lewis 11 and Mr. Ayerst had failed to “allege[] facts suggesting Mr. Van Idour’s licensing problems were sufficiently severe to fall in line with” the rationale for dismissal without a showing of prejudice in Solina. In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 363. As noted above, it was improper for the lower court to rely on a federal case to distinguish controlling authority of this Court. Even so, under the reasoning the Court of Appeals cited from Solina, Mr. Ayerst and Mr. Lewis are still entitled to relief. The unauthorized practice of law is a strict liability crime. State v. Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d 155, 172, 456 P.3d 1172 (2020). As it is undisputed that Mr. Van Idour was practicing without authorization, it is likewise undisputed that he was engaging in criminal conduct while representing Mr. Ayerst and Mr. Lewis. It therefore defies logic to suggest that Mr. Van Idour’s licensing problems may not have been “sufficiently severe” under Solina to justify relief. Mr. Van Idour possessed the exact conflict of interest that justified reversal without a showing of prejudice in 12 Solina. The lower court cited Solina, but reached the opposite of the conclusion that Solina demands. This Court, not federal case law, governs who may practice before Washington courts, and by extension the consequences when somebody does so without authorization. See Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 215. The federal court decision in Solina, as well as the other federal cases the State cites, are thus inapplicable when the question is the consequence under state law for the representation of a criminal defendant by a person unauthorized under state law to practice law. The rule urged by the State would render this Court’s supervision of the practice of law in Washington a mere formality so far as indigent defense in criminal cases is concerned. Admission to practice in some other jurisdiction is not the same as authorization to practice here. Laws vary from state to state, including in ways that may be important to a 13 particular client’s case. See, e.g., State v. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d 58, 88-89, 292 P.3d 715 (2012) (contrasting the elements of robbery in Washington from those in California). As such, the Court of Appeals doubly erred, first by applying federal precedent to distinguish controlling Washington precedent in Ratliff, and second by misapplying that federal precedent to reach the opposite of the conclusion it required. Given the undisputed facts, the convictions of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst should be invalidated. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d at 219. C.The Posture of These Cases as Personal Restraint Petitions Does Not Preclude Relief This case illustrates the fact that a criminal defendant may have no way of knowing until long after the fact that a court has appointed an unqualified person to act as their counsel. In this case, Mr. Van Idour’s status did not come to light until after the trial. In re PRP of Ayerst, 17 Wn. App. 2d at 358-59. This means that often, as here, the only vehicle for seeking relief when the lawyer is unauthorized to practice law in Washington could be a PRP.RCW 10.73.150 (describing the circumstances under 14 which counsel is appointed); RAP 16.11 (describing the PRP process). This reality would undercut the right to counsel if an aggrieved defendant were required to show not just unauthorized counsel, but prejudice in order to show a meritorious claim. The State contends that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst cannot enforce their right to counsel because of the procedural posture of these cases. This argument ignores the fact that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst not only did not, but reasonably could not, know Mr. Van Idour’s unauthorized status until after their direct appeals. The State says that on a personal restraint petition, Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst bear the burden of showing that the error below resulted in “actual and substantial prejudice.” State Br. 8 (quoting In re Pers. Restraint Petition of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 671, 327 P.3d 660 (2014)).2 If the State were correct as applied here, criminal defendants would be left without a remedy 2 The State’s citation to In re PRP of Cross is incorrect. The State likely intended to cite page 676. 15 under these circumstances to enforce their undoubted right to counsel. Fortunately for the sake of enforcing the right to counsel, this Court in In re PRP of Cross went on to explain after the passage the State cited that “where the petitioner has not had a prior opportunity for judicial review, the petitioner need show only that he is restrained under RAP 16.4(b) and that the restraint is unlawful under RAP 16.4(c).” In re PRP of Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 677. The context in which the unauthorized practice occurred also matters when considering the remedy. The parties before the trial court included, of course, the prosecutor and the defendants, and a superior court judge presided. Both the prosecutor and the judge were well positioned to inquire as to Mr. Van Idour’s status. See Pet’r’s Suppl. Br. at 2 (noting that Mr. Van Idour never showed a bar number on his pleadings). Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst, in contrast, reasonably relied on none other than Mr. Van Idour himself to protect their interests. Given this imbalance, rote 16 reliance on the burden in a personal restraint petition fails to acknowledge the important rights at stake for criminal defendants. The right to counsel is too important to surrender to these procedural vicissitudes. “The constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel is a cornerstone of ‘any meaningful modern concept of ordered liberty.’ ” Davison v. State, 196 Wn.2d 285, 303-04, 466 P.3d 231 (2020) (Gonzalez, J., concurring) (quoting State v. A.N.J., 168 Wn.2d 91, 96, 225 P.3d 956 (2010)). It follows that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Ayerst were unlawfully restrained within the meaning of RAP 16.4(c)(2) because their convictions were obtained in violation of this constitutional right. Where, as here, the facts demonstrating the constitutional violation were not reasonably knowable until after the original criminal case was over, such an important constitutional right cries out for recognition rather than for procedural obstacles. 17 VI.CONCLUSION For these reasons, Amicus Curiae the Washington State Office of Public Defense respectfully asks this Court to grant the personal restraint petitions of Justin C.Lewis and Robert L.Ayerst. This document contains 2,950 words, excluding the parts of the document exempted from the word count by RAP 18.17. RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 11th day of April, 2022.
