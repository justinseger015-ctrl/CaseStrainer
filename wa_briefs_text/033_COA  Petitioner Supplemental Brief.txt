Is Mr. Ayerst entitled to relief when the impartiality of the judge presiding at his trial can reasonably be questioned following credible allegations that the judge committed rape and violated multiple provisions of the Washington Code of Judicial Conduct during his time as a judge in Asotin County? 2. Was Mr. Ayerst denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel was not licensed to practice law in Washington at the time of Mr. Ayerst’s trial and never completed the requirements for admission to the Washington State Bar under APR 8(c)? B.STATEMENT OF THE CASE A jury convicted Robert Ayerst of attempted burglary in the second degree, malicious mischief in the second degree, and bail jumping based on an incident that occurred on September 6, 2016. See State v. Ayerst, 8 Wn. App. 2d 1028 (2019) (Unpublished). The substantive facts related to the incident are not at issue in this Personal Restraint Petition (PRP). Mr. Ayerst’s trial counsel was Robert Van Idour. Personal - 1 - Restraint Petition of Robert Ayerst. Mr. Van Idour is not licensed to practice law in Washington but is licensed to practice in Idaho and is in good standing with the Idaho State Bar Association. Declaration of Robert Van Idour. At the time of Mr. Ayerst’s trial, Mr. Van Idour was contracted to provide public defense services in Washington pursuant to APR 8(c), but a search of the Washington State Association (WSBA) lawyer directory revealed that he never acquired a license to practice in Washington as of April 2020. Declaration of Robert Van Idour. Lise Ellner, counsel on appeal, contacted Asotin County and disciplinary counsel for the WSBA in regard to this issue. On April 19, 2019, disciplinary counsel for the bar provided Ms. Ellner with a letter and formal complaint confirming that Mr. Van Idour was never licensed or authorized to practice law in Washington State. See Appendix A (attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein). Ms. Ellner contacted the Washington State Office of Public Defense to seek additional information regarding Mr. Van Idour’s status when obtaining an indigent defense contract in Asotin County. See Appendix B (attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein). - 2 - The email exchanges indicate that Asotin County incorrectly asserted that Mr. Van Idour was under the supervision of Neil Fox working pro hac vice, when according to disciplinary counsel for the WSBA, Mr. Van Idour was not authorized to work pro hac vice. See Appendices A, B.The presiding judge at Mr. Ayerst’s trial was Asotin County Superior Court Judge Scott Galina. Judge Gallina was aware of this fact and issued an order that purported to permit Mr. Van Idour to practice in Washington without a Washington State license. See Appendix A.Judge Gallina was arrested roughly a year after Mr. Ayerst’s trial and charged with second degree rape, indecent liberties, and assault in the third degree with sexual motivation based on allegations of sexual misconduct made by multiple members of his judicial staff. See State of Washington v. Scott D.Gallina, Asotin County Superior Court Case 19-1-00066-02. Division Three of the Washington State Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Ayerst’s convictions and sentence following a direct appeal. State v. Ayerst, 8 Wn. App. 2d 1028. Mr. Ayerst later filed a PRP requesting relief on several grounds. Personal Restraint - 3 - Petition of Robert Ayerst. Mr. Ayerst alleged that Judge Gallina’s arrest and prosecution are evidence of bias that affected the outcome of his trial, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Van Idour was never licensed to practice law in Washington, that the testifying detective perjured himself by denying the existence of a recorded interview, and that the prosecutor had improper contact with prospective jurors before voir dire. Personal Restraint Petition of Robert Ayerst. The state responded to the claims in Mr. Ayerst’s PRP and this court appointed Mr. Ayerst counsel to provide supplemental briefing. Order Appointing Counsel (4/28/2020). - 4 - C.ARGUMENT 1. BECAUSE MR.AYERST SHOULD BE GRANTED RELIEF TRIAL COURT’S ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS BE JUDICIAL GUARANTEED JUDGE ACCUSED OF RAPING HIS STAFF CANNOT A ROLE THE BY Criminal defendants currently under restraint may seek collateral relief by way of a PRP following an unsuccessful direct appeal. RAP 16.4; In re Coats, 173 Wn.2d 123, 140, 267 P.3d 324 (2011). In a PRP, appellate courts may grant a defendant relief where: The conviction was obtained . . . in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State of Washington; or . . . Other grounds exist for a collateral attack on a judgment in a criminal proceeding . . . instituted by the state or local government . . . RAP 16.4(c)(2, 5). The petitioner must prove the existence of an error by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479, 490, 251 P.3d 884 (2010). When the alleged error is constitutional in nature, the petitioner must show that it caused actual and substantial prejudice to be entitled to relief. Matter of Sandoval, 189 Wn.2d 811, 821, 408 P.3d 675 (2018) (citing Coats, 173 Wn.2d at 132). Criminal - 5 - defendants in Washington have a due process right to a fair trial before an impartial judge. In re Swenson, 158 Wn. App. 812, 818, 244 P.3d 959 (2010) (citing Wash. Const. art. I, § 22). a. Mr. Ayerst’s is entitled to relief because the trial court’s be to multiple violations of questioned due Washington’s Code of Judicial Conduct reasonably impartiality can Mr. Ayerst suffered actual and substantial prejudice because his trial was held before a judge who could not ensure due process was satisfied where the judge was arrested and charged with rape against members of his own staff. The allegations alone call into question Gallina’s ability to fulfill his judicial obligations which at a minimum require compliance with the law. Code of Judicial Conduct (CJC) RULE 1.1 provides in part: Compliance with the Law A judge shall comply with the law, including the Code of Judicial Conduct. Id. Furthermore, CJC 1.2 provides: Promoting Confidence in the Judiciary A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes integrity, and public confidence impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. independence, the in - 6 - Id. Other provisions in the CJC directly address the type of allegations Judge Gallina currently faces. CJC 2.3 provides: Bias, Prejudice, and Harassment (A) A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office, including administrative duties, without bias or prejudice. (B) A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, or engage in harassment, including but not limited to bias, prejudice, or harassment based upon race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation, and shall not permit court staff, court officials, or others subject to the judge's direction and control to do so. Id. (emphasis added). The comments to this rule explain that: [3] Harassment, as referred to in paragraphs (B) and (C), is verbal or physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward a person on bases such as race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, socioeconomic status, or political affiliation. [4] Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome. Id. - 7 - Finally, CJC 2.3 also requires a judge act impartially and fair. This means: A judge shall uphold and apply the law and, shall perform all duties of judicial office fairly and impartially. Id. The allegations of rape and sexual assault against Judge Gallina suggest that he violated multiple provisions of the CJC during his time as an Asotin County Superior Court Judge. This alleged pattern of misconduct raises serious concerns about Judge Gallina’s ability to dispense justice in a fair and impartial manner. Because Judge Gallina’s impartiality can reasonably be questioned, Mr. Ayerst was denied his due process right to a fair trial. See CJC 2.11(A). This error entitles him to relief under RAP 16.4(c)(2). 2. ROLE JUDGE GALLINA’S AS PRESIDING JUDGE DURING MR.AYERST’S TRIAL VIOLATES THE APPEARANCE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE OF In addition to abiding by the CJC, judges must also adhere to the appearance of fairness doctrine. Swenson, 158 Wn. App. at 818 (citing State v. Dominguez, 81 Wn. App. 325, 328, 914 P.2d 141 (1996)). This doctrine requires a judge to disqualify himself from a proceeding if he is biased against a party or if the judge’s - 8 - impartiality could reasonably be questioned. Swenson, 158 Wn. App. at 818 (citing CJC 2.11(A)). Washington courts have consistently held that that the appearance of fairness in judicial proceedings is especially important in the context of criminal proceedings. State v. Chambers, 176 Wn.2d 573, 293 P.3d 1185 (2013); State v. Finch, 181 Wn. App. 387, 326 P.3d 148 (2014); State v. Gamble, 168 Wn.2d 161, 187, 225 P.3d 973 (2010); State v. Ra, 144 Wn. App. 688, 175 P.3d 609 (2008). In Finch, this court held that a trial judge, who was presiding over two separate cases involving a minor child, violated the appearance of fairness doctrine because the judge was unable to separate the two cases and his role as the impartial judge versus the investigator/prosecutor when he attempted to investigate the truth of the minor child's allegations in the criminal proceeding by ordering a polygraph in the juvenile proceeding. Id. This Court held that the trial court’s inability to maintain its neutral role and insistence on using the juvenile proceeding to investigate the veracity of the allegations in the criminal case violated the - 9 - appearance of fairness doctrine and ordered remand before a new judge. Finch, 181 Wn. App. at 399. In Ra, this Court noted that the trial court's comments on the defendant's character and scolding the defendant were inappropriate, and “did not show proper restraint, and should not have been made.” 144 Wn. App. at 705. The Ra court did not, however, decide whether the appearance of partiality warranted reversal, because it had reversed on another issue, but it did order that the new sentencing hearing be held before a different judge. Id. Although not dispositive, Ra is nevertheless instructive of what this Court has previously noted as inappropriate judicial behavior. Far worse than in Finch and Ra, here, Judge Gallina is accused of raping and sexually assaulting his staff. He was removed from his duties pending trial. These allegations alone go to the heart of the notion of fairness and impartiality because a judge accused of violent crimes does not appear able to behave in a lawful and impartial manner. Judge Gallina’s alleged behavior, brought to light by multiple victims, demonstrates his contempt for the law and his colleagues. Regardless of whether he is convicted, - 10 - pending such charges, the appearance of fairness is destroyed because a reasonably prudent, disinterested observer would be unable to conclude that the parties received a fair, impartial, and neutral hearing. This court should reverse Mr. Ayerst’s conviction and grant him relief in the form of a new trial. RAP 16.4(a). 3. ASSISTANCE AYERST WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE OF COUNSEL WHEN TRIAL COUNSEL WAS NOT LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN WASHINGTON AND NEVER COMPLETED THE REQUIREMENTS OF APR 8 HIS Mr. Ayerst was denied his constitutional right to counsel by the appointment and representation of Mr. Van Idour, who was never licensed to practice law in Washington State. The Sixth Amendment guarantees indigent defendants in state and federal criminal proceedings, appointed counsel in any case in which a term of imprisonment is imposed. U.S.Const. Amend. VI, XIV; U.S. v. Bryant, 136 S.Ct. 1954 (2016); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed. 2d 799 (1963); State v. Johnson, 179 Wn.2d 534, 315 P.3d 1090 (2014), cert. denied, 135 S.Ct. 139, 190 L.Ed. 2d 105 (2014). - 11 - Art. I, § 22 (amend 10) provides the equivalent right to appointed counsel. State v. Roberts, 142 Wn.2d 471, 515, 14 P.3d 713 (2000). The purpose of this right is to guarantee all defendants the right to a fair trial. Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 158-59, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed. 2d 140 (1988). “[T]he assistance of counsel is among those ‘constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error’”. Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed. 2d 426 (1978) (citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 43, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed. 2d 705 (1967)). The right to counsel granted by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a licensed attorney. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 398, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed. 2d 424 (1977); City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, 217, 667 P.2d 630 (1983) as in “counsel” the Sixth Amendment and Const. art. 1, § 22 includes only the courts to practice law. those persons authorized by used Id; see also United States v. Turnbull, 888 F.2d 636, 638 (9th Cir. 1989); Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 167 (1983). “Nothing in the language or the history of the sixth - 12 - amendment to the Constitution” contemplates permitting representation by persons who are not qualified attorneys because unlicensed lay representation does not “further” the objectives of the Sixth Amendment. United States v. Wright, 568 F.2d 142, 143 (9th Cir 1978). “[The] right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours.” Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344. “Reason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person hauled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth.” Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344. Representation by a person not licensed to practice before the court in which he or she appears does not satisfy a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and voids any proceeding in which the person appears. Solina, 709 U.S. at 167 (citing Harrison v. United States, 387 F.2d 2013, 212-13 (1967), reversed on other grounds, 392 U.S. 219, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed. 2d 1047 (1968) (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468 (1938))). - 13 - For example, in Solina, the defendant was represented by a person who went to law school but never passed the bar, although from the record he appeared skilled. Solina, 709 F. 2d at 160-65. The United States argued that this should issue should be considered under a harmless error standard. Id. The Court, citing Zerbst, reversed and remanded for a new trial holding that the state was incorrect to suggest a harmless error standard and admonished that “prosecutors, trial courts, or both, would do well to make sure that persons representing criminal defendants are duly licensed to practice.” Solina, 709 F. 2d at 169 fn. 10; Zerbst, 304 U.S. at 465-69. “[O]ne never admitted to practice law and therefore who never acquired the threshold qualification to represent a client in [a Washington State] court cannot be allowed to do so . . . for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.” United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682, 697 (9th Cir. 1986). Other circuits agree with this holding. See, e.g., Solina, 709 F. 2d at 168; Harrison, 387 F. 2d at 212-14. It is structural error “if an indigent defendant is denied an attorney” because the proceeding is then a “fundamentally unfair” one. Weaver v. Massachusetts, ___ U.S. ___, 137 S.Ct. 1899, - 14 - 1903, 198 L.Ed. 2d 420 (2017) (citing Gideon, 372 U.S. at 343–345 (emphasis added)). The Court in Weaver explained that “structural error”: means only that the government is not entitled to deprive the defendant of a new trial by showing that the error was “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24. Weaver, 137 S.Ct at 1908.1. Once Mr. Ayerst was appointed counsel by the trial court, he was entitled to representation by a Washington State licensed lawyer at all critical stages of his trial. Here, under the state and federal constitutions and the legal precedent cited herein, Mr. Ayerst was denied his constitutional right to counsel because Mr. Van Idour was never a licensed lawyer in Washington State. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458; Gideon, 372 U.S. 335; Solina, 709 F.2d 160. The remedy for violation of Mr. Ayerst’s right to counsel requires automatic reversal. Gideon, 372 U.S. at 343-45. D.CONCLUSION Mr. Ayerst is unlawfully restrained because his conviction was obtained in violation of Washington State law and he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel 1 Burden on defendant to show prejudice in certain ineffective assistance of counsel claims involving public trial rights not objected to during trial. - 15 - during trial.

Our office is currently reviewing the applications submitted by counties for 2018 public defense improvement funds, and we are seeking one clarification regarding the application submitted by Asotin County. The application indicates that Robert J.Van Idour currently has a new contract for representation on felony cases. However, based on the Washington State Bar Association’s website, he appears to not be a licensed attorney within Washington. We were curious as to what arrangement might be in place for an out-of-state attorney to take on a full-time felony contract.
