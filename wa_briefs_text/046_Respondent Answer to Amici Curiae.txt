WHETHER RATLIFF IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CASE AT BAR WHEN A LEGAL INTERN IS NOT LICENSED TO PRACTICE IN ANY JURISDICTION OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF APR 9? 3. WHETHER SOLINA IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CASE AT BAR WHERE MR.VAN IDOUR HAD PASSED A BAR EXAM AND WAS LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN AT LEAST ONE JURISDICTION? RESPONDENT'S ANSW~R TO AMICI CURIAE 1 II.INTRODUCTION Since the Respondent filed their Supplemental Brief 1n this case, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (11ACLU"), The Defender Initiative and the Washington Defender Association jointly ("The Defender Initiative"), and the Office of Public Defense have each filed an Amicus Curiae brief. Collectively, these briefs raise several issues including the standard to apply, the role of the Standards of Indigent Defense ("SID") in determining the right to counsel, the application of City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212 (1983), and whether a conflict of interest exits similar to the one in Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2nd Cir. 1983). To the extent that Amici argue for a per se standard of prejudice, the Respondent has already addressed that issue in its Supplemental Brief. The remaining issues are addressed herein. RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 2 Ill. ARGUMENT 1. THE STANDARDS OF INDIGENT DEFENSE ARE SIMILAR IN EFFECT TO OTHER PRACTICE RULES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DETERMINE THE BASELINE REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNSEL Amicus American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and Amicus The Defender Initiative/Washington Defender Association suggest this Court should find that the Petitioners were deprived of "counsel" for constitutional purposes because Mr. Van ldour failed to comply with the Standards of Indigent Defense set out in Court Rule 3.1. Amicus Curiae Brief of American Civil Liberties Union of Washington ("Amicus ACLU") at 3".'5; Brief of Amici Curiae The Defender Initiative and Washington Defender Association (Amici Defender Initiative) at 26. However, the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington rejected the use of professional standards to determine what qualifies as "counsel" under the Sixth Amendment. 466 U.S. 668, 688-89 (1984). The Washington Court of RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 3 Appeals has since done the same. State v. Flores, 197 Wn.App.1, 10 (2016). This Court should adoptthose courts' sound reasoning and ignore this red herring argument. In Strickland, the United States Supreme Court set forth the standard used to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of "counsel" for constitutional purposes. 466 U.S. at 667. In doing so, the Court examined the purpose of the right to counsel and, in light of that purpose, the circumstances under which that right is denied. Id. at 684~686. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the purpose of the right to counsel is to ensure a fair trial. Id. at 686. Thus, a defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights only when their conviction "resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that render[ed] the result unreliable." Id. at 687. Additionally, the Court emphasized that "[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association Standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-1 .1 to 4-8.6 (2d ed. 1980) ("The Defense RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 4 Function"), are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides." Id. at 688. The reasoning behind this is twofold. First, the Court expressed concern that establishing a more rigid set of rules "would interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and restrict the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions." Id. at 689. Second, the Court recognized that where professional standards are generally intended to improve the quality of legal representation, the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is "simply to ensure that criminal defendants receive a fair trial." Id; see also Reese v. Peters, 926 F.2d 668 (7th Cir. 1991) (discussing the difference between "[t]he constitutional question" about trial counsel's competence and disbarment, which can occur for other reasons). Similarly, as discussed in the Respondent's supplemental brief, Division Three of the Court of Appeals held in State v. Flores that noncompliance with the Standards of Indigent Defense (SID) as set forth in Criminal RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 5 Rule 3.1 does not constitute a per se violation of the right to counsel. 197 Wn.App. at 15. 1 In that case, the appellant pointed to two distinct violations of the SID as deprivation of his right to counsel. See Id. at 8-10. While the court was unable to address the issue of counsel's certification under CrR 3.1{d){4) on the record provided, the court was able to fully address whether the defendant's right to counsel was violated when his attorney did not have two years of criminal practice experience as required by Standard 14.2 B.Flores, 197Wn.App. at 12. In rejecting the appellant's argument, Division Three considered this Court's holdings in State v. A.N.J, 168 Wn.2d 91 (2010) and In re. Pers. Restraint of Gomez, 180 Wn.2d 337 (2014) that similar guidelines put forth in the Washington Defender Association's Standards for Public Defense Services did not establish minimum Sixth 1 Contrary to Amicus the Defender Initiative's assertions, the Respondent did not intend attribute the holding of Flores to this Court. Amici DI at 24. Respondent simply wished to indicate that this Court had declined the opportunity to reverse Division Three's ruling. RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 6 Amendment requirements. Flores, 197 Wn.App. 13-14. Additionally, the court there recognized that rules promulgated by this Court create procedural, but not substantive, rights. Id. at 10-11, citing State v. Templeton, 148 Wn.2d 193,21 2 (2002). Based on this, the Flores court concluded that the SID serve. a similar role to other professional standards and that "adoption of the SID did not redefine what constitutes counsel under the Sixth Amendment." Id. at 15. A similar conclusion was reached by Division Two in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Mabruk, 2018 WL 3026101 (2018) (see GR 14.1), review denied, 191 Wn.2d 1023 (2018). With regard to the SID, this Court should uphold the Division Three's holding in Flores. To do otherwise would incorrectly place more emphasis on whether counsel followed a particular checklist than the more important question of whether the defendant received a fair trial. Furthermore, as the Flores court worried: To do anything else is to impose a higher RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 7 for indigent representation standard of defendants than the Sixth Amendment requires for retained counsel. Here, even if Mr. Raheem had committed no errors at all, or had achieved an acquittal on all counts save some uncontested misdemeanor charge, Mr. Flores to receive a new would still noncompliance with Standard 14.2. Such an outcome places the rule above that it is supposed to effectuate. trial due Id. at 14-15. Here, trial counsel had 30 years of experience in criminal defense and was in good standing in at least one jurisdiction at the time he represented Petitioners. To conclude, in essence, that Mr. Van ldour violated the Petitioners' right to counsel simply because he did not file the correct paperwork on time runs contrary to the purpose of the Sixth Amendment. Additionally, Amicus the ACLU and Amicus the Office of Public Defense complain that unless this Court reverses the Petitioners' convictions, its supervision of indigent defense is effectively unenforceable. Amicus ACLU at 10, Brief of Amicus Curiae Washington State Office of Public RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 8 Defense (Amicus OPD) at 130. These arguments ignore the other tools of enforcement available to this Court. Lawyers in violation of professional standards may be subject to discipline by this Court through the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. See ELC 2.3. Furthermore, decisions by the disciplinary board may be reviewed directly by this Court. See ELC 12.3-4. This was the case here when Mr. Van ldour was ultimately suspended from the practice of law in Washington for eighteen months. In re Robert Jerry Van ldour, Supreme Court No. 202,021-6, Order Imposing 18-month Suspension, September 7, 2021. Similarly, judges are subject to discipline by the Commission on Judicial Conduct. See generally RCW 2.64~ Decisions by the Commission are reviewable by this Court. See, e.g., DRJ 1. If this Court determines that misconduct occurred, it may impose the discipline recommended by the Commission or "any other sanction [this Court] deems proper." DRJ 9(c). This Court's decision is final, subject to a limited reconsideration process. See DRJ 9(d). Through RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 9 these processes, this Court has the ability to regulate the actors directly involved in compliance (or noncompliance) with the rules at issue here.2 Requiring reversal in cases based on attorneys' or judges' noncompliance with the SID or various other practice standards is not only unnecessary, it also punishes innocent third parties, especially crime victims who are then forced to go through the trial process a second time. 2.THE HOLDING IN RA TL/FF.WHICH EXTENDS THE DEFINITION OF "COUNSEL" TO INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING UNDER SPECIFIC RULES THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE QUALIFY, IS DISTINGUISHABLE.Amici stress the importance of City of Seattle v. Ratliff, 100 Wn.2d 212, in determining whether a complete 2With regard to any argument that the prosecutor's office should have somehow enforced Mr. Van ldour's compliance with the APRs and SID, the Respondent would respectfully remind this Court that RCW 10.101.040 prohibits city attorneys, county prosecutors, and law enforcement officers from selecting public defenders. RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 10 deprivation of counsel occurred in this case. See, e.g., Amicus ACLU at 12; Amici DI at 21; Amicus OPD at 8. However, not only is Ratliff distinguishable from the case at bar, Amici overlook the importance of the other issue raised in that appeal. In Ratliff, this Court held that representation by a legal intern licensed under APR 9 ("rule 9 intern"), who has been prevented from complying with that rule, is a per se violation of the right to counsel. 100 Wn.2d at 221 . By the time that case reached this Court, two separate issues had been raised. The defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because the intern was given insufficient time to prepare his case and was prevented from consulting his supervising attorney as required by APR 9. Id. at 215. In addition, the Court of Appeals, sua sponte, questioned whether representation of an indigent defendant by a law student, without the presence of a supervising attorney in court, constituted a per se violation of the right to counsel. Id. RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 11 Much of the language cited by Amici comes from this Court's discussion of the challenge to APR 9, including this Court's reminder to the legal community that it has the constitutionally granted power to determine who may appear before the bar, and that this power is both "well established" and "inviolate." Id. at 215. However, that language is directed at this Court's power to include certain individuals in, rather than preclude them from, the definition of "counsel." This Court explained that it promulgated and adopted APR 9 to allow 1'lesser qualified persons to engage in limited practice" so long as certain specific requirements are adhered to Id. at 216. Ultimately, this Court held that when APR 9 is complied with, a criminal defendant receives legal assistance "sufficient to meet with both state and federal constitutions." Id. at 218. Only then did this Court turn to the facts of the defendant's case. Whereas a law student acting in compliance with APR 9 does qualify as counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes, this Court, apparently relying on RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 12 federal precedent, held, "representation by a law student intern who fails to comply with the conditions placed upon his or her practice does constitute an absolute denial of the right to counsel which requires reversal." Id. at 19 (emphasis added), citing Cheatham v. State, 364So.2d 83, 84 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (failure to comply with requirements that supervising attorney be present and defendant be informed of student status); In re Moore, 63 III.App.3d 899, 904 (1978) (failure to inform court of student status and failure to obtain defendant's written consent); cf. People v. Masonis, 58 Mich.App. 615, 619 (1975) (law student representation did not violate right to counsel where defendant was aware of student status, general effective assistance of counsel standards were met, and there was no violation of student practice rules). Because the record demonstrated that the law student representing the defendant was prevented from complying with the requirements of APR 9 which would have · otherwise qualified him as counsel, this Court held that there was a RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 13 denial counsel "in the circumstances of this case." Id. at 213. The case at bar is distinguishable from the facts of Ratliff. This Court's discussion in Ratliff of the power to regulate the practice of law is oriented towards this Court's constitutional power to decide when an individual may affirmatively be admitted to practice in Washington State. It does not necessarily follow that every individual represented by counsel acting out of compliance with the APRs is denied counsel. Absent the requirements of APR 9, a legal intern is comparable to a lay person because they have never been licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction and, in many cases, have not yet completed their legal studies. By contrast, an attorney admissible pro hac vice under APR 8, while not licensed in Washington state, has completed their legal studies and qualified as an attorney in at least one jurisdiction. See APR 8(b ). Even if that attorney were to later fail to comply with the requirements of APR 8, he would still have legal training and specialized knowledge RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 14 necessary to ensure a fair trial. 3. AMICl'S ANALYSIS OF SOLINA IGNORES CRUCIAL LANGUAGE OF THAT CASE DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE CASE AT BAR.Finally, Amicus the OPD asserts that the court below incorrectly relied on Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2nd Cir. 1983} at all to reach its conclusion. Amicus OPD at 11 . However, they then argue that Division Three incorrectly applied the holding Solina based on the fact that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed in Washington at the time he represented the Petitioners. Amicus the ACLU touches briefly on this issue as well. Amicus ACLU at 12-13. Aside from being contradictory, this argument also ignores specific language in Solina stating that: In so construing the original understanding of the term "counsel" we do not intimate that any technical defect in the licensed status of a defendant's representative would amount to a violation of the Sixth Amendment. We limit our decision in this case to situations where, unbeknown to the defendant, his representative was not authorized to practice law in any state, RESPONDENT'S ANSWER TO AMICI CURIAE 15 and the lack of such authorization stemmed from failure to seek it or from its denial for a reason going back to legal ability, such as failure to pass a bar examination, or want of moral character ... Solina, 709 F. 2d at 167. There, the "attorney" in question had twice failed the bar examination and was never admitted in any state. Id. at 162. Here, Mr. Van ldour had passed a bar examination been admitted in a neighboring Jurisdiction for over three decades. On those facts alone, the case at bar is distinguishable from Solina. V.CONCLUSION The new issues raised by Amici fail to demonstrate that Petitioners were denied "counsel" for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Furthermore, the Respondent maintains that a demonstration of prejudice is required as set forth in the Supplemental Brief. Therefore, the Respondent respectfully requests that this Court affirm the Petitioner's convictions.
