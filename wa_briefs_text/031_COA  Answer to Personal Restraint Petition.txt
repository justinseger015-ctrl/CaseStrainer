FILED Court of Appeals Division Ill State of Washington 11/14/2019 1 :27 PM No. 99941-4NO. 369650 COURT OF APPEALS, DIVISION Ill STATE OF WASHINGTON In the Matter of Personal Restraint of ROBERT L.AYERST, Petitioner. RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION 1. IDENTITY OF RESPONDING PARTY State of Washington, Respondent, through its attorney of record, Curt L.Liedkie, Chief Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for Asotin County. 2. STATEMENT OF RELIEF SOUGHT An order dismissing Petitioner's Personal Restraint Petition pursuant to RAP 16.11 (b). 3. FACTS RELEVANT TO REVIEW The Petitioner was convicted after jury trial of Attempted Burglary in the Second Degree, Malicious Mischief in the Second Degree, and Bail Jumping (C Felony), from events occurring September 6, 2016. See State v. Ayerst, 35867-4-111, 2019 WL 1568060 (Div. 111, Apr. 11, 2019)(Unpublished)(attached hereto). 1 The underlying facts of the case are largely immaterial and need no 1The State does not cite the unpublished decision for precedent, but rather as establishing the procedural and factual background of the case. RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attomey P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 1 (509) 243-2061 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 discussion herein. Pertinent to the issues raised, which this Court specifically requested that the State address, are recited herein. The Petitioner was represented initially by John Fay, but Mr. Fay was later replaced by attorney Robert Van ldour who represented the Petitioner through conclusion of trial. Bond Order (10/04/16), and Motion and Order Allowing Withdrawal and Substitution. Mr. Van ldour was, and is still currently, a member of the Idaho State Bar Association, in good standing, and was assigned, at that time, to provide public defense, on contract under APR 8(c). Declaration of Robert J.Van ldour. Mr. Van ldour represented the Petitioner throughout the remainder of the case, including trial and sentencing. Report of Proceedings (hereinafter RP}, generally. During trial, the State called Detective Brian Denny, who testified that he interviewed the Petitioner and provided the substance of statements made by the Petitioner. RP 90-2. Thereafter, Det. Denny was cross examined on these statements. RP 98-9. Det. Denny was never asked, nor did he testify concerning the existence of any recorded interview, nor was one offered into evidence by either the State or the Petitioner at trial. RP 90-2, 98-9. The Petitioner testified, during cross examination, that he believed that Det. Denny had recorded the conversation, but State's counsel pointed out that the Petitioner had declined to be recorded. RP 189-90. Upon being pressed, he clarified that he wasn't sure, due to the passage of time, whether it had been recorded or not. RP 189-90. More than a year after the Petitioner's trial and sentencing, the judge who presided over trial, Scott D.Gallina, was arrested and charged with sexual related felony and gross misdemeanor charges for actions unrelated to this trial. Those charges are currently pending. See State of Washington v. Scott D.Gallina, Asotin Superior Court Cause 19-1-00066-02. RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 2 (509) 243-2061 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The Petitioner appealed his conviction, and it was affirmed by this Court in an unpublished opinion. See State v. Ayerst, supra. The Petitioner then filed this personal restraint petition, alleging a myriad of claims, the majority of which this Court has declined to request responses from the State. The issues posited by the Petitioner are largely confusing and not well articulated. As the State understands, this Court has requested responses to the following claims: 1) that the Judge Gallina "is not credible", which the State understands to be a claim of bias; 2) that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice in Washington; 3) that the State's attorney had improper contact with members of the jury venire prior to jury selection; and 4) that Det. Denny committed perjury by denying the existence of a recording of his interview with the Petitioner. If there are others that the Court is requesting response to, the State would ask that the Court clarify. 4. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF AND ARGUMENT RAP 16.11(b) authorizes dismissal of the petition if the petition is clearly without merit. The Respondent submits that the issues raised by the Petitioner are without merit and lack any basis in fact or in the law. A PRP is not a substitute for a direct appeal. In re Pers. Restraint of Hagler, 97 Wn.2d 818, 824, 650 P.2d 1103 ( 1982). Courts are reluctant to overturn a settled judicial decision where the Petitioner has had an opportunity for direct appellate review. In re Pers. Restraint of Cross, 180 Wn.2d 664, 676, 327 P. 3d 660 (2014). Therefore, there are limitations on the use of a PRP to collaterally attack a conviction. Hagler, 97 Wn.2d at 824. A personal restraint petition must state with particularity the factual allegations which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. In re Pers. Restraint of Rice, 118 Wn.2d 876, 886, 828 P.2d 1086 (1992). Factual allegations must be supported by evidence. 118 Wn.2d at 886. If the record does not support the factual RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 3 (509) 243-2061 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 allegations, then the petitioner must show through affidavits or other forms of corroboration that competent and admissible evidence will establish the factual allegations. 118 Wn.2d at 886. Bald assertions and conclusory allegations are not sufficient. Id. To be entitled to collateral relief through a PRP the Petitioner must prove the existence of error by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Pers. Restraint of Monschke, 160 Wn. App. 479, 490, 251 P. 3d 884 (2010). Assuming error can be shown, he is also required to prove prejudice. Cross, 180 Wn.2d at 676. The significance of the level of prejudice depends on the type of error shown. Id. To be entitled to relief for a constitutional error, a petitioner must also prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "actual and substantial prejudice." Id. (Emphasis added). This prejudice "must be determined in light of the totality of circumstances," and exists only if the error "so infected petitioner' s entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process." In re Pers. Restraint of Music, 104 Wn.2d 189, 191, 704 P.2d 144 ( 1985). To be entitled to relief for a nonconstitutional error, a petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the error caused "a fundamental defect resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice." In re Pers. Restraint of Elmore, 162 Wn.2d 236,251, 172 P.3d 335 (2007) (emphasis added). With this as the backdrop, the State will respond to the issues raised for which response was requested. A.THE RECORD DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY CLAIM THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS BIASED OR PREJUDICED AGAINST THE PETITIONER.The Petitioner claims that "the Honorable Scott Gallina was not credible." The Appellant presumably is arguing that the legal troubles that the judge has currently pending cast negative aspersions at his qualifications to sit as a RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 4 (509) 243-2061 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 superior court judge. The State does not disagree that such allegations, if true, are reprehensible and would certainly be cause for his removal from office. His claim further appears to presuppose that the fact of subsequent charges necessarily results in the Petitioner's conviction being rendered void. However, the Petitioner offers no legal authority for this proposition and the State, after diligent search, could not find a single case where a conviction was reversed based upon subsequent criminal behavior of the trial judge. The State found a few cases involving judges who were involved in criminal activities, but they are distinguishable. In In Interest of McFall, 533 Pa. 24, 617 A.2d 707, 711 (1992), a number of defendant's sought new trials based upon allegations that the judge therein, while working for the F.B.I. as an informant as a result of having been caught committing a criminal act, continued to preside over criminal and juvenile matters during that time. McFall, at 32. In McFall, a quid pro quo bargain existed where the judge's cooperation would be made known to the same authorities who appeared before her to prosecute cases against the appellees therein. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that the appearances of fairness mandated new trials, not because of the underlying criminal act, but because the judge's biases and loyalties could reasonably and objectively be questioned. This is because, to a disinterested observer, the judge would likely be viewed as attempting to curry favor with the prosecuting authorities, which necessarily would have included the jurisdiction over whose case she continued to preside. Therein, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated: One could reasonably conclude that, under the circumstances, Cunningham's cooperation with the United States Attorney's office cast her in the role of a confederate of the prosecutors in the appellees' cases. McFall, 533 Pa. 24 at 35. No such alliance occurred here, where the Judge Gallina was not arrested until more than a year after the Petitioner's trial and did not preside over any more cases thereafter. RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 5 (509) 243-2061 In a more infamous case, a Pennsylvania Juvenile Court Judge received secret payments from the owners of a facility where juveniles were housed, and in those cases, the Court reversed delinquency adjudications. See In re Bruno, 627 Pa. 505, 566, 101 A.3d 635, 671-72 (2014)(discussing Former Judge Mark Ciavarella's corruption and the fallout therefrom). However, in that case, the judge receiving bribes had a clear pecuniary interest which clearly impugned the appearance of his impartiality in the decisions rendered in those cases. There, it is easy to recognize that the judge had a financial interest in sending adjudicated delinquents to the detention facility that was paying him to do so. Here, no such profit motive or other incentive is alleged or apparent. While the State neither dismisses nor condones the conduct of Judge Gallina, there are no indications or reasons to speculate that his impartiality in this case was subject to reasonable question. A judge should not only be impartial, but should appear so. In re Swenson, 158 Wn. App. 812, 818, 244 P.3d 959 (2010). 11Evidence of a judge's actual or potential bias must be shown before an appearance of fairness claim will succeed." State v. Chamberlin, 161 Wn.2d 30, 37, 162 P.3d 389 (2007). While, if true, the allegations against Judge Gallina seriously impugn his character. However, the allegations fail to demonstrate that his partiality would be questioned; i.e. that one side had an advantage going into the case. Frankly, standing alone, the fact that a judge is involved in criminal activities would tend to lead an outside observer to believe that a defendant, rather than the State would have the advantage. Here, the judge was not working with authorities or seeking some benefit from the State in exchange for leniency on pending charges, nor did he have any pecuniary or personal interest in the outcome of the case. The record does not so reflect any bias or appearance thereof, nor has the Petitioner so demonstrated. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attomey P .0. Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 6 (509) 243-2061 B.WHILE TRIAL COUNSEL WAS NOT FORMALLY LICENSED.HE WAS ELIGIBLE TO PRACTICE UNDER APR 8 AND THERE IS NO SHOWING THAT HE WAS OTHERWISE UNAUTHORIZED TO PRACTICE, NOR DOES THE PETITIONER DEMONSTRATE PREJUDICE.There can be no question that a criminal defendant has the right to effective assistance of trial counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 22 of the Washington State Constitution. See, e.g., In re Pers. Restraint of Davis, 152 Wn.2d 647,672,101 P.3d 1 (2004). Where a defendant is denied counsel because the "attorney" was not licensed in any state, prejudice may be presumed. See Ferrara v. Keane, 806 F.Supp. 472, 474 (S.D.N.Y. 1992), atrd, 2 F.3d 403 (2d Cir. 1993). However, this per se rule does not apply where the attorney is licensed to practice but merely lacks a license in the jurisdiction where the case occurs. Id. Here, Mr. Van !dour was licensed (for more than 30 years) in Idaho. Even assuming that his qualifications under APR 8(c) were lacking, he was an attorney licensed to practice. As a result, there was no per se deprivation of counsel because Mr. Van !dour was licensed to practice in Idaho, and the Petitioner must therefore make a further factual showing. To establish that the right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated, the Petitioner must make two showings: that counsel's representation was deficient and that counsel's deficient representation caused prejudice. Id. (quoting State v. McFarland, 127 Wn.2d 322, 334-35, 899 P.2d 1251 (1995)). The Petitioner makes no showing that Mr. Van ldour was ineffective. Other than the claim that Mr. Van ldour was not licensed to practice law in Washington, the Petitioner points to no specific conduct or action that constituted deficient performance. His claim therefore necessarily fails. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 7 (509) 243-2061 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 C.STATE'S COUNSEL DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH PROSPECTIVE JURORS, EXCEPT AS APPROPRIATE THROUGH VIOR DIRE, AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SUCH CLAIM.The Petitioner claims that State's counsel had inappropriate contact with prospective jurors. He accuses the deputy prosecutor of having coffee and laughing with the jury venire in the hallway before trial began. The State vehemently denies any such conduct occurred.2 The record does not support this claim, which most certainly would have been brought to the attention of the court by trial counsel. The Petitioner's claims lack any factual basis aside from his own self serving accusations. This is insufficient as a matter of law and should be rejected out of hand by this Court. See In re Pers. Restraint of Williams, 111 Wn.2d 353, 365, 759 P .2d 436 {1998). D.DET.DENNY DID NOT COMMIT PERJURY NOR DID HE TESTIFY CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF ANY RECORDING.Finally, the Petitioner claims that Det. Denny committed perjury when he testified that the interview was not recorded and by "failing to play the recording." Once again, the Petitioner's claims are unsupported by the record. First, Det. Denny never testified concerning the existence of any recording. It was the Petitioner who testified to the existence of a recording. Then when pressed on cross examination, he acknowledged that he wasn't even sure that the recording existed. The State represents that no such recording was made because the Petitioner refused to be recorded. See RCW 9.73.030. In any event, his claims of perjury necessarily fail in any event, where the detective offered no such 2As an aside, it should be noted that the deputy prosecutor in question does not drink coffee. RESPONSE TO PERSONAL RESTRAINT PETITION Benjamin C.Nichols, Prosecuting Attorney P.O.Box 220, Asotin, WA 99402 Page 8 (509) 243-2061 testimony. Once again, the Petitioner offers no evidence or substantiation of his claims. His petition should be dismissed as wholly unsupported by fact or law. In summary, the petition filed in this matter, based upon the record, is without merit. In the best interests of justice this petition should be dismissed. The Respondent respectfully requests that an order dismissing this petition be entered. Dated this JJ./~ay of November, 2019.

CASJ:MANAGl:R FILED APRIL 11, 2019 In the Office of the Clerk of Court WA State Court of Appeals, Division m IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON DMSION THREE STATE OF WASHINGTON, Respondent, V.ROBERT L.AYERST, Appellant. ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) No. 35867-4-III UNPUBLISHED OPINION LAWRENCE-BERREY, C.J. - Robert L.Ayerst appeals his conviction for attempted second degree burglary. He contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. He also filed a statement of additional grounds for review in which he appears to assert that his trial counsel was ineffective and that the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the charges. We reject his challenges and affirm. FACTS The State charged Mr. Ayerst with attempted second degree burglary and second degree malicious mischief, 1 stemming from Mr. Ayerst's actions on the early morning of 1 Mr. Ayerst was later charged with bail jumping by amended information based on his failure to appear in court as required for a pretrial hearing on April 3, 2017. No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayers! September 6, 2016. The facts are related from the trial testimony. Bruce Meacham arrived at his business, the Mr. Suds Car Wash in Clarkston, Washington, at approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of September 6, 2016. He observed that the doors to the equipment room appeared damaged2 and that a tow strap was hanging from the handle but nothing appeared to be missing. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 64-65. Mr. Meacham called the police and provided security footage from the car wash parking lot. The footage depicted Mr. Ayerst arriving at the car wash around 2:20 a.m. in his white GMC pickup truck. Mr. Ayerst drove his truck through the car wash lot, past the doors to the equipment room, and pulled into one of the wash bays. He exited his truck and began washing it. An unidentified passenger exited the truck holding what appeared to be a tow strap with a metal hook under his sweatshirt. The passenger walked off camera in the direction of the equipment room doors. He then returned to the truck, no longer carrying the tow strap. A short time later, the passenger again exited the truck and disappeared off camera in the direction of the equipment room. 2 Mr. Meacham testified that he obtained an estimate of approximately $1,900 to repair the damaged doors. 2 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst After Mr. Ayerst finished washing the truck, the passenger rejoined him and the truck backed out of the wash bay, exited the lot, and entered on the other side of the car wash. The truck pulled up to the vacuums next to the car wash and then backed up out of view of the camera to the area in front of the equipment room doors. The truck remained in that position a short time before it pulled forward and exited the lot. The equipment room doors could not be seen on the security footage, but the footage did show that Mr. Ayerst's headlights "dip[ped]" as the truck began to pull forward. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 75. Detective Bryon Denny testified that he believed the lowering of the headlights was consistent with the vehicle having some type of dragging motion on it because the area where the truck was located was an asphalt area where there were no dips or bumps that would have caused the truck "to jar in that motion." RP at 76. He posited that Mr. Ayerst and his unidentified accomplice had attached the tow strap to the doors and the truck, and then pulled away, springing the doors open and leaving the tow strap behind. Officer Brian Odenborg observed Mr. Ayerst's truck at approximately 2:55 a.m. at the Zip Trip convenience store located across the street from Mr. Suds. The officer noted that the two men sitting in the car did not make eye contact or otherwise acknowledge his presence, which he found suspicious. Due to the hour of the night and the apparent lack 3 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst of purpose to the men's presence at the store, he ran the plate on the truck through dispatch and it returned to Mr. Ayerst, a resident of Dayton, Washington. The State subsequently arrested Mr. Ayerst, who denied that he was in Clarkston on September 6, 2016. When police showed him a still frame from the security footage, Mr. Ayerst denied that he was the person in the footage and claimed that he often loaned out his vehicle. At trial, Mr. Ayerst testified that on the early morning of September 6, he was driving from his home in Dayton to visit his sister in Weippe, Idaho, to discuss the circumstances surrounding their mother's death. Along the way, he stopped and picked up a stranded motorist who needed a jump. Mr. Ayerst then decided to stop at Mr. Suds to wash his truck. The unidentified motorist accompanied him to the car wash, and they went to the Zip Trip to get food once Mr. Ayerst finished washing his truck. Mr. Ayerst ultimately decided not to visit his sister and, instead, drove back home to Dayton. Mr. Ayerst denied attaching a tow strap to his truck or seeing his passenger attaching a tow strap to anything. His theory was that his headlights "dipped" as described by Detective Denny because there were two homeless individuals sleeping in the car wash parking lot and he had to brake suddenly when backing up toward the doors to avoid backing over one of the sleeping men. Defense counsel's theory at trial was that 4 No. 35867-4-111 State v. Ayerst the security footage demonstrated there was insufficient time off-camera for either Mr. Ayerst or his passenger to attach the tow strap to the truck. The jury found Mr. Ayerst guilty of attempted burglary in the second degree, second degree malicious mischief, and bail jumping. The trial court imposed a standard range sentence of 55.5 months based on Mr. Ayerst's offender score of 22, rejecting the State's request for an exceptional sentence pursuant to RCW 9.94A.535(2)(c). ANALYSIS On appeal, Mr. Ayerst claims there was insufficient evidence to convict him of attempted burglary in the second degree. A.STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR SUFFICIENCY CHALLENGES "Due process requires the State to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Washington, 135 Wn. App. 42, 48, 143 P.3d 606 (2006). In a sufficiency challenge, the inquiry is "whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192,201, 829 P.2d 1068 (1992). All reasonable inferences are drawn in the State's favor, and the evidence is interpreted most strongly against the defendant. Id. Circumstantial evidence receives the same weight as direct evidence. State v. Thomas, 150 Wn.2d 821, 874, 83 P.3d 970 (2004). This court 5 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst defers to the fact finder on the resolution of conflicting testimony, credibility determinations, and the persuasiveness of the evidence. Id. at 874-75. B.SECOND DEGREE BURGLARY Mr. Ayerst claims there is insufficient evidence to support his attempted burglary conviction because the State failed to prove that he had any intent to commit a crime inside the car wash. He contends that under State v. Jackson, 112 Wn.2d 867, 774 P.2d 1211 {1989), intent to commit a crime could not be inferred from his equivocal behavior. A person commits second degree burglary "if, with intent to commii a crime against a person or property therein, he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a building other than a vehicle or a dwelling." RCW 9A.52.030(1). A person "attempts" an offense when, with the intent to commit a specific crime, he or she takes a substantial step toward committing the crime. RCW 9A.28.020{1). A "substantial step" is conduct that is "' strongly corroborative of the actor's criminal purpose.'" State v. Townsend, 14 7 Wn.2d 666,679, 57 P.3d 255 (2002) (quoting State v: Aumick, 126 Wn.2d 422,427,894 P.2d 1325 (1995)). The requisite intent for attempted burglary may be inferred where the defendant attempted to enter a building by force and the manner of entry illustrated the defendant's intent to enter for illegal reasons. See e.g., State v. Bencivenga, 137 Wn.2d 703, 974 P.2d 832 (1999) (sufficient evidence of intent where defendant attempted to pry 6 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst open door to Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) at 3 :30 a.m.); State v. Brooks, 107 Wn. App. 925, 927-28, 29 P.3d 45 (2001) (defendant's use of screwdriver to attempt to open door, rather than conventional methods of entry, illustrated defendant's intent to enter apartment for illegal reasons). Mr. Ayerst claims that Jackson requires reversal of his attempted burglary conviction. The defendant in Jackson was charged with attempted second degree burglary after he repeatedly kicked a door window, damaging it, and fled when he realized a police officer was watching him. 112 Wn.2d at 870. Over the defendant's objection, the trial court instructed the jury that a person who attempts to enter or remain unlawfully in a building may be inferred to have acted with the intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein. Id. at 872. The Washington Supreme Court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial, holding the court erred by giving the instruction where the defendant engaged in equivocal behavior that could evince an intent to commit burglary or an intent to commit malicious mischief. Id. at 876. Mr. Ayerst's reliance on Jackson is misplaced because Jackson only addressed instructional error and did not analyze the sufficiency of the evidence. Since Mr. Ayerst 7 No. 35867-4-Ill State v. Ayerst does not assert instructional error, Jackson's analysis is largely irrelevant to Mr. Ayerst's case.3 Instead, Mr. Ayerst's case is controlled by Bencivenga, 137 Wn.2d 703. In that case, a witness saw the defendant attempting to pry open the back door of a KFC at 3:30 a.m. Id. at 705. The defendant admitted to trying to force the door open but claimed he did not intend to steal anything and was simply trying to win a bet. Id. at 706. The trial court found the defendant guilty of attempted second degree burglary and Division One of this court reversed based on its reading of Jackson. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the analysis in Jackson only applies to the propriety of a permissive inference instruction. Although a judge may be restricted from guiding jurors' assessments of the facts, "[n]othing forbids a jury ... from logically inferring intent from proven facts, so long as it is satisfied the state has proved that intent beyond a reasonable doubt." Id. at 709. "An essential function of the fact finder is to discount theories which it determines unreasonable." Id. Although an inference of guilt should not arise where other reasonable conclusions may be drawn, ultimately "it is the 3 This court recently recognized in an unpublished opinion that "Jackson does not apply to the question ofwhether sufficient evidence supports a jury's verdict." State v. Perez, No. 35043-6-IIl, slip op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Aug. 9, 2018) http://www.courts. wa. gov /opinions/index.cfm ?fa=opinions. show0pinion&filename=3 50 436MAJ 8 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst province of the finder of fact to determine what conclusions reasonably follow from the particular evidence in a case." Id. at 711. The evidence here was sufficient to permit a jury to find that Mr. Ayerst intended to burglarize the Mr. Suds. Mr. Ayerst drove his truck to the car wash at 2:30 in the morning accompanied by a passenger carrying a tow strap that matched the strap found on the damaged doors. The passenger disappeared in the direction of the doors and reappeared without the strap, and Mr. Ayerst proceeded to back the truck up to the equipment room doors. Although there was no direct evidence that Mr. Ayerst or his passenger attached his truck to the doors, the footage demonstrated that Mr. Ayerst's headlights "dipped" as he pulled away from the area of the doors, indicating that the truck was experiencing some drag or resistance consistent with the truck being attached to the doors. An officer then observed Mr. Ayerst and his passenger sitting across the street in the Zip Trip parking lot, suggesting that they may have been watching to see if their actions had drawn any attention before returning to remove property from the equipment room. This circumstantial evidence tended to show that not only was Mr. Ayerst trying to enter the Mr. Suds, he did so with the intent to commit a crime therein. The jury was entitled to make the reasonable inference that Mr. Ayerst intended to enter the car wash and remove property. 9 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst C.STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR REVIEW (SAG) Mr. Ayerst has filed a SAG in which he appears to assert ineffective assistance of counsel as well as an argument that the trial court erred by denying his Knapstad4 motion to dismiss all charges. i. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Mr. Ayerst claims his trial counsel erred by failing to present evidence that the Clarkston Police Department received a call at 3:30 a.m. from a neighbor of the Mr. Suds reporting a loud noise, nearly one hour after Mr. Ayerst left the Mr. Suds. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant carries the burden of demonstrating ( 1) the attorney's performance was deficient-that is, it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) the deficiency prejudiced the accused-that is, absent the deficiency there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. State v. Humphries, 181 Wn.2d 708, 719-20, 336 P.3d 1121 (2014). To rebut the presumption of effective assistance of counsel, the defendant must establish the absence of any "conceivable legitimate tactic explaining counsel's performance." State v. Reichenbach, 153 Wn.2d 126, 130, 101 P.3d 80 (2004). 4 State v. Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d 346, 729 P.2d 48 (1986). 10 No. 35867-4-ITI State v. Ayerst The only reference in the record regarding a neighbor hearing a noise is an Investigative Narrative prepared by Officer Lorz indicating that, "A neighbor stated that he may have heard a noise around 0330 hours that morning." CP at 43. There is nothing in the record to indicate that a neighbor called to report a noise nor is there any information regarding the neighbor's identity or trial counsel's efforts to investigate this statement. The factual record is therefore insufficient to review this argument. Moreover, Mr. Ayerst has failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the outcome of his trial would have been different had this limited evidence been introduced. The security footage placed Mr. Ayerst, a resident of Dayton, at the Mr. Suds in Clarkston in the middle of the night and in the company of a man carrying a tow strap that matched the strap found on the damaged doors. It also showed him backing his truck up to the doors and his headlights "dipping" as he drove away, suggesting the truck was attached to the doors by the strap. Although Mr. Ayerst denied damaging the doors and offered his own theory for why the headlights "dipped" as he drove away, the jury clearly did not find Mr. Ayerst credible. Given this evidence, Mr. Ayesrt has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that introduction of the single statement from the investigative report concerning the neighbor would have changed the outcome of the trial. 11 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst ii. Motion to Dismiss Charges Pursuant to Knapstad Mr. Ayerst also claims he did not commit any of the crimes for which he was convicted and appears to allege that the court erred by denying his pretrial Knapstad motion to dismiss the charges. A trial court has the inherent power to dismiss a criminal prosecution for insufficiency of the charge. Knapstad, 107 Wn.2d at 352-53. A court may only grant a defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss if there are no disputed facts and the undisputed facts are insufficient to support a finding of guilty. Id. at 356. A trial court's denial of a Knapstad motion is not reviewable on appeal following trial. State v. Jackson, 82 Wn. App. 594,918 P.2d 945 (1996). Since Mr. Ayerst's case proceeded to trial, his claim that the trial court erred by denying his Knapstad motion is not reviewable by this court. To the extent Mr. Ayerst's SAG is read as claiming insufficient evidence to support his three convictions, this argument also fails. As explained above, sufficient evidence supported Mr. Ayerst's conviction for attempted second degree burglary. As to the remaining offenses, Mr. Ayerst argues evidence outside the record that this court may not consider. On the record before this court, it appears that Mr. Ayerst's convictions were supported by sufficient evidence. 12 No. 35867-4-III State v. Ayerst CONCLUSION We conclude that sufficient evidence supports Mr. Ayerst's conviction for attempted second degree murder and reject Mr. Ayerst's arguments raised in his SAG.Affirmed.
