HE WAS REPRESENTED BY A PERSON WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE STATE BAR AND FURTHER ARGUES THAT MR.LEWIS HAS FAILED TO SHOW PREJUDICE •... MR.LEWIS DISAGREES IDAHO 1. MR.LEWIS WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO COUNSEL As the State agree's There can be no question that a criminal Defendant has the Right to the Effective Assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment U.S.Cost. and Art 1, Section 22, of The WA.Const. Brief Of Respondent at p.7 However, the State argues while counsel was not admitted to the State of Washington's Bar to practice law. Counsel was in fact admitted to the Idaho State Bar. Thus, Mr. Lewis' Right to Counsel was satisfied. The State relies on Ferrara V.Keane 806 F.Supp. 472 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) in support of thier argument that Mr. Lewis was Afforded his right to counsel. But Ferrara dealt with a Attorney who met the mSUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS• to the practice of law. Because he was admitted in the new jersey BAR for more than 30 years and was well familiarized with general criminal procedure because of his years spent as a county pro secuter. Here, Mr. Lewis' counsel decieved the trial court into allowing pro hac vice temporary admission to practice law in Asotin county. Resaulting, in an Officii.ai complaint filed by our state Bar OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL to the SUPREME COUJIR~' Alledging the following count's. 3 COUNT ONE: BY PRACTICING LAW IN WASHINGTON WITHOUT AUTHORIZAT ION, RESPONDENT VIOLATED RPC 5.S(b), and/or RPC 8.4(b) by: ( violating RCW 2.48.180) COUNT TWO: BY MAKING FALSE and/or MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN HIS JULY 23, 2018 LETTER TO one, RESPONDENT VIOLATED RPC 8.1(a) and /or RPC 8.4(c) But in this case Mr. Lewis' Counsel sought a contract to pro vide indigent legal services to criminal defendants. Prequisft~e to the contract was that counsel be admitted to Practice law in the state of washington. Mr. Lewis' trial counsel knew that if he didnt get admitted soon. He would lose the contract and any proceeds he would be entitled to. As a resault, he decieved the trial court into issuing a Order authorizing limited ability to Practice Law Pro Hae Vice. So he wouldnt lose the contract and the ability to recieve funds for legal services provided to the indigent criminal defendants. Once counsel was approved to apply for the Bar, Jire was then required to take the next steps in order to obtain admission.It has never been established that Mr. Lewis counsel pocessed the necessary skill's to practice law in this state. The only thing Mr. lewis' counsel did show is the skill's to lie and trick the court into issuing an order to allow Pro Hae Vice representat ion of criminal defendants in Asotin County. This kind of con duct cannot go unpunished nore can it be said Mr. Lewis has had his Constitutional Right to Counsel. 11 noting that the Sixth Amenment guarantee of counsel means the assistance by an attor ney who has been found qualified to represent a client as by Admission to the Bar II United States v. Mouzin, 785 F.2d 682, 696 (9th Cir. 1985) 4 The State further avers, that this court should require the defandant in such circumstance's to make a showing under the ineffective assistance of counsel test required by Strickland that (1) counsel provided deficient performance and (2) that resaulted in prejudice. Ignore's the fact in these case's the defendant claim's outright denial of right to counsel. The State attempt's to belittle Solina v. United states, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983) Which Mr. Lewis relies. Because Solina had dealt with a person not being represented by a person who's not a member to any Bar. But counsel here was a member of the Idaho State Bar. Misses the point. In Solina the court reasoned: Both before and since strickland, we have held that where a defendant was represent ed by an attorney who, unbeknown to the .. defendant, was not licensed to practice .. law, that defendant has been denied the .. constitutional right to counsel. Even where the representative was trained in the law, where the representative appa rently furnished reasonably competent rep resentation and where evidence against the defendant was so overwhelming that he wou ld almost certainly have been convicted ... regardless of who represented him. We held that a defendant's sixth amendment right .. to counsel is violated where, without the defendants knowledge, "his representative was not authorized to practice law in any state, and the lack of authorization stem med from failure to seek it or from its .. denial for a reason going to legal ability such as failure to pass bar examination, or want of moral character .. 709 F. 2d at 167. We there held that "application of a per se rule appears to us to be required in a case like this by teachings of the supreme court 709 F. 2d at 168. 5 Mr. Lewis' counsel was not licensed or even authorized to be able to practice law in this State, Mr. Lewis never gave his con sent to be represented by such a person, and this person was only able to represent Mr. Lewis because he decieved the trial court to issue a Order allowing Pro Hae Vice Limited Admission to Practice Law. Should this court find that Mr. Lewis recieved his right to counsel under these circumstances would ignore the Supreme Court Admission To Practice Rules set in place in order for someone to become admitted and/or authorized to Practice Law in our State. APR 1 (b) Prerequisites to the Practice of Law state: Except as may be otherwise provided in these rules, a person shall not appear as an attorney or counsel in any of the courts of the state of washington, or practice law in this state, unless that person has. passed the washington state bar examination, has ... complied with the other requirements of these rules and is an active member of the washington state Bar association (reffered to in these rules as the Bar •. association). A person shall be admitted to the prac tice of law and become an active member of the Bar. association only by order of the supreme court •.... It's uncertain as to why the State here would ask this court to ignore the principles in our State and excuse counsel's action of decieveing our trial court into allowing him to practice law. Not to mention decieveing the 100s of Criminal defendant's that he represented who all believed that they were being represented by a licensed and/or aiuthor~ed person to practice law in there State.[1] Not to mention by a judge who was later criminally charged for sexual assualt and harassment. [1] The TrialJudge Scott D.Gallina was charged by our state for sexual assualt's and harassment. Shortly after Mr. Lewis was in his court room. It's important to note this is the same judge at issue who gave Mr. Lewis' counsel Pro Hae Vice Admission. 6 As shown above it cant be said that Mr. Lewis has recieved his constitutional right to counsel. Should this court allow it to stand that a person purported to be an attorney can just go into any courthouse in our State and Obtain a Pro Hae Vice Order to admit him to Practice Law. Would ignore our State's BedRock principles that have always been in place. As layed out in the Supreme Court Rule's Admission to Practice (APR). In essence this Court would be opening up our boarders and saying any person who is a member in another State Bar can come to our state and Practice Law without haven to be a member to our State Bar and/or obtain Authorization from our Supreme Court to Practice Law. That such Person's dont need to be of good Moral or have to Qualify for our Bar examination; and in each instance in cases where they have been appointed by the trial court the sixth amendment and article 1, section 22 right to counsel has been and always will be satisfied. Even though there skill's and abilities have never been tested. Nore thier quailification's been reviewed by any per~on. Not to mention decieved the trial court into given him Pro Hae Vice ability to practice law. This cant stand and as the CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT requires: CANON 1: An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society •••• CANON 2: Judges should respect and comply with the law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary •.. To set such a rule that anybody from anywhere that is not admitted to practice law in our state but in another State can 7 simply come to Washington State and Practice Law and not have to follow our rules of Admission to Practice Law. Would not in any way promote public confidence in the integrity and impartaility of the judiciary. But rather, create a fear of it and our system of justice as a whole. As such, This court should find Mr. Lewis was denied his right to counsel and protect the constitutional and statutory right of the accused. As well the judicary and the criminal justice system as a whole. 1. PREJUDICE IS PRESUMED WHERE A DEFENDANT IS DENIED COUNSEL Next the State avers, that Mr. Lewis need's to establish the Strckland test that (1) counsel Provided deficient performance and (2) resaulting prejudice. The state avers, that this is so because Mr. Lewis was provided counsel. Mr. Lewis Disagrees. There are two rationales for applying the Per Se rule. The first is II Jurisdictional II and applies in cases where the att orney is not duly licensed. It stems from the Supreme court's decision in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 468, 82 L.Ed. 1461 58 S.Ct. 1019 (1948), that the failure to provide a criminal defendant with counsel created II a jursidictional bar to a valid conviction II see Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160, 168-69 (2nd Cir.)( discerning no meaningful distinction between total absence of representation and representation by unlicensed co unsel ). The second, rationale is based on motions of conflict of in terest, which applies in cases where the lawyer is not duly li censed. see United States v. Novak, 903 F.2d 883, 890 (2nd Cir. 1990). Under these circumstances, the defence is necessarily compromised b'e'cause the advocate II cannot wholly be free from 8 fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should lead the prosecuter or the trial judge to inquire into his [orWEBEt'], back ground and discover his II o:fi::' her own wrongdoing. Solina, 709 F. 2d at 164. Under either rational, it is plain that for a defendant to prevail on a per se claim, the defendant must show that his or her attorney had an actual substantive defect in licensure or an actual conflict of interest that existed at the time of trial.see e.g., Novak, 903 F. 2d at 890; Solina, 709 F. 2d at 164. A.THE STATE AGREES THAT COUNSEL SUFFERS ACTUAL DEFECT IN COUNSEL FOR MR.LEWIS'S LICENSURE There stand's no question Mr. Lewis' attorney was not ever a licensed and/or authorized counsel in the State of washington. As such, the Per Se rule should apply. Because Counsel for Mr. Lewis was not licensed or lawfully authorized to practice law. see. att achment D Official Complaint filed to supreme court •. see also Response Brief of Petitoner at p.6. In our state. B.THERE EXISTED A TRUE CONFLICT OF INTERST Because counsel was not licensed in our state, the defence is necessarily compromised because the advocate II cannot wholly be free from fear of what might happen if a vigorous defense should lead the prosecuter or trial judge to inquire into his background and discover his "wrongdoing" which infact happened and now the subject of an official complaint filed by the Washington state.:r.itn. Bar to the State Supreme Court ... Because both of these rationaies have been met Mr. Lewis has satisfied the requirements necessary to adopt the Per Se rule in this case and reverse Mr. Lewis' conviction and Order a new trial by a licensed and authorized counsel in our State. 9 IV.CONCLUSION Based on the above Mr. Lewis ask's this court to reject the use of the Strckland test and apply the Perse rule in this case and find Mr. Lewis was denied counsel and reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial with qualified and proven licensure in our State.
