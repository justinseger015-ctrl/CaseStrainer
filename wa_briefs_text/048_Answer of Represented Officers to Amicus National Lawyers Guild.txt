These requests sought the whereabouts of six (6) off duty Seattle Police Officers on January 6, 2021 and their activities at ex-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal Rally”. On March 10, 2021, the trial court declined to issue a preliminary injunction preventing release of OPA’s records before it completed its investigation. CP 399-404. This appeal ensued. In early July 2021, after the completion of their comprehensive investigation, OPA made its findings public during the pendency of this appeal (“OPA Summary”) by issuing a 21-page report. See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1. In summary, no sanction was recommended as to these four Officers represented by the undersigned (“Represented Officers”). -1- The OPA unequivocally recognized the Represented Officers’ Constitutional right to attend a political demonstration while off duty. The OPA could not have been any clearer: these Represented Officers did not commit any misconduct, participate in any insurrection, and they were fit to continue serving as Seattle Police Officers without sanction. The OPA issued its determination while fully recognizing “the political and factual views espoused at the rally were antithetical to the beliefs of a strong majority of the Seattle community.” Id. at p. 20. Indeed, Andrew Myerberg, Director of the Office of Police Accountability virtuously recognized this Constitutional right, even if he “as the decider in this matter, disagree vehemently with everything the rally stood for.” Id. Reviewing the facts today in October 2021, after the release of the OPA Summary—as well as after taking judicial notice of considerable press attention and the submission of inflammatory and reckless Amicus Curiae—the facts and issues of this case have not only crystalized. The facts have -2- fundamentally changed from the March 2021 TRO hearing. These developments have strengthened the Represented Officers’ Constitutional position prohibiting disclosure. Specifically, here, the intentionally incitive Brief of Amicus Curiae The National Lawyers Guild Inc. (“NLG Brief”) does not change the fact that the Represented Officers’ First Amendment Constitutional rights supersede the PRA’s disclosure presumption. II.RESPONSE TO ISSUES OF CONCERN TO NLG BRIEF 1. With the July 2021 release of the full OPA Summary and the names of the Police Officers who committed misconduct, there is now no “compelling government or public interest” in disclosing the names of the Represented Officers who were cleared of any misconduct. 2. The First Amendment to Constitution supersedes the PRA and protects the Represented Officers against public disclosure of their names. -3- III.STATEMENT OF THE CASE The Represented Officers hereby reincorporate the facts contained in their Supplemental Brief filed on September 30, 2021, pp. 2-5. IV.ARGUMENT Nobody denies that an element of the crowd that assembled on January 6, 2021 failed to assemble peacefully and, instead, proceeded to advance on the Capitol in a horrific riot. Indeed, two (2) Seattle Police officers (“Unrepresented Officers”) were deemed to have trespassed on U.S.Capitol grounds. The OPA Summary found these two (2) Unrepresented Officers to have committed misconduct. They were subsequently terminated. See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1, pp. 1, 15-18. Their names have been released.1 They are not the Represented Officers. 1 2 Seattle cops who were at US Capitol in January are fired (apnews.com) at https://apnews.com/article/seattle-police-reform-da98b06a9245d496204bf13e7b32ca90 -4- However, the public OPA Summary determined that the four (4) Represented Officers did assemble peacefully, broke no laws whatsoever, did not participate in any riot, and, ultimately, “that the officers attended this rally is absolutely protected by the Constitution.” Id. at p. 20. Here, these very Constitutional rights of speech, petition, and peaceful assembly supersede any PRA predisposition to disclose the Represented Officers’ identities. This is because disclosure of their names would lead to, inter alia, harassment and a “chilling effect” upon the Officers’ First Amendment Constitutional rights—the actual standard this Court should apply when evaluating this case. See Dream Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 384 F.3d 990, 1012 (9th Cir. 2004). 1. The Represented Officers Constitutional Rights Supersede the PRA At the outset, the PRA “must give way to constitutional mandate.” Freedom Found. v. Gregoire, 178 Wn.2d 686, 695, 310 P.3d 1252 (2013) (citation omitted). As such, the PRA’s catch-all “other statutes” exemption incorporates any protections afforded by the Washington or United States Constitutions. Id.; -5- see also Seattle Times Co. v. Serko, 170 Wn.2d 581, 594-97, 243 P.3d 919 (2010) (discussing how constitutional fair trial rights may serve as an exemption under the PRA); Yakima County v. Yakima Herald–Republic, 170 Wn.2d 775, 808, 246 P.3d 768 (2011) (noting in dictum that the argument that constitutional provisions can serve as PRA exemptions “has force”). As recognized by the OPA Summary, and basic Constitutional knowledge, public picketing and protesting is free speech in and of itself. Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, Ala., 394 U.S. 147, 152, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed. 2d 162 (1969). Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized a right to remain anonymous, yet active and in plain sight in the context of First Amendment protected activity. As Justice Stevens observed in Watchtower Bible, 536 U.S. 150, 166, 122 S.Ct. 2080, 2089, 153 L.Ed. 2d 205 (2002), a Jehovah Witness proselytizing door-to-door, in public, still retained a right to anonymity. Id. (“…there are a significant number of persons who support causes anonymously… -6- anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one’s privacy as possible”). The same right to be anonymous, yet active and in plain sight, applies to political speech and association. See e.g. Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 64, 80 S.Ct. 536, 538, 4 L.Ed. 2d 559 (1960) (holding First Amendment protects the anonymous distribution of unsigned handbills); McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 342, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed. 2d 426 (1995) (holding similarly to Talley); Nat'l Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. State of Ala. ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1488 (1958) (privacy in group association may be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association). Quite simply, if one can prove that “constitutional principles provide [them] with a constitutional privilege [then a] PRA claim must fail”. Freedom Found, 178 Wn.2d at 695. Here, since there is a clear First Amendment right being -7- exercised, and no compelling interest identified, the PRA must give way to the Constitutional rights of the Represented Officers to remain anonymous and not have their activities “chilled.” 2. NLG Amici’s Defamatory and Reckless Attempt to Establish a “Compelling Interest” Only Serves to Support Plaintiffs’ Need For First Amendment Protections The public OPA Summary cleared the Represented Officers and deemed them fit to continue to serve. This report fully details the OPA’s investigative process, the evidence gathered and reviewed, the ultimate decision finding no misconduct, and the rationale behind that determination. Unfortunately, reading the NLG Brief, it is almost certain the NLG Amici went ahead and filed without reading the OPA Summary. For instance, the NLG Amici consistently (i) references six (6) officers, when there are only four (4) officers being represented2, (ii) demand “disclosure of… administrative proceedings” when the OPA Summary has already been 2 NLG Brief at p. 18. -8- released3, and (iii) state the unrefuted point that criminal acts take one outside the ambit of First Amendment, when it is clear the Represented Officers committed no crime.4 Even if the NLG Amici read the OPA Summary, which is hard to believe, the NLG Brief does not discuss the OPA Summary even one time. This glaring omission discredits the NLG Brief at the outset rendering many of its points moot, if not recklessly misleading. a. The NLG Amici Pejoratively Assert a Reckless the Unsubstantiated Narrative Represented Officers Without Any Support. against The NLG Brief states that the “general public” has a compelling interest in knowing the identities of “white supremacist—affiliated police officers.”5 The NLG Brief then churns through a series of news articles and reports all related to a deplorable list of racist Facebook posts, emails, texts, videos, and other actions by police officers. The NLG Brief then discusses distressing statistics regarding how race plays into 3 Id. at p. 23. 4 Id. at p. 29. 5 Id. at pp. 4-5. -9- wrongful arrests and convictions.6 Finally, the NLG Brief goes over the alarming disparity in deaths by race at the hands of police.7 This is all disgusting and horrifying. The NLG Brief concludes their meta-conglomeration—purposely written to shock the conscious of any reader—by stating: The issue of white supremacy in policing leads to worse outcomes for Black, Indigenous, and other people of color than their white counterparts, and non-white citizens should be armed with at least the knowledge of which officers are more likely to be dangerous than others. This Court, viewing the appeal in light of these distressing and well documented facts, should find a compelling public informational interest in disclosure of the identities and administrative proceedings pertaining to the police officer plaintiffs who chose to associate with avowed white supremacist at the January 6, “Stop the Steal” rally. See NLG Brief at p. 6. However, there is a large shameless hole in the NLG Brief. The NLG Brief attributes all these horrible things—wanton racist texts and emails, wrongful racist arrests, racist convictions, and 6 Id. at pp. 10-12, 14-15, 18-19. 7 Id. at p. 20. -10- even civilian deaths—to these four (4) Represented Officers who the NLG Amici know nothing about. The OPA Summary states the only thing that these the Represented Officers did do which was attend “a political rally in support of a President who was and is still reviled by many in Seattle and that was in furtherance of a theory of election fraud that was, at best, discredited and, at worst, knowingly fabricated.” See 9/21/21 Resp. Mot. at Ex. 1, p. 20. These are the only facts that the NLG Amici, or anyone else, actually know about the Represented Officers. Thus, before smearing these Represented Officers as racists with guns merely for supporting ex-President Donald Trump and his discredited theories, the NLG Amici should have looked out their cloister’s window (or connected to the internet) and they would have easily learned: • 74,224,319 people voted for Donald Trump in 2020, which is 46.9% of all votes cast.8 8 Presidential Election Results https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president. and Electoral Map 2020 (cnn.com) at -11- • 20% of all Black men voted for Donald Trump in 2020. Including 20% of Black men with advanced educational degrees.9 • Donald Trump received over 30% of the Latino vote.10 • One third of all Americans believe that election fraud cost Donald Trump the election11 While the NLG Amici can assert that everyone who supported Donald Trump is an incorrigible racist, that position cannot be supported by tens of millions of racial minorities who voted for Donald Trump. And, if the NLG Amici allege that only vile racists believe the election was stolen, even with this narrower subset, NLG Amici’s math is such that over 68,000,000 voting age Americans are white supremacists who support racially based wrongful convictions and police-caused deaths. 12 9 Black men shift slightly toward Trump in record numbers, polls show (nbcnews.com) https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-men-drifted-democrats-toward-trump-record-numbers-polls-show-n1246447. 10 Trump gained with Latino voters in 2020.

In all of their dangerously assumptive diatribe against the Represented Officers, the NLG Amici point to no statement calling for racists to assemble on January 6, 2021 to celebrate white supremacy, undertake racist acts, or cheer on extra-judicial minority arrests and killings. There is no doubt the speakers at the “Stop the Steal” rally podium spewed all sundry of discredited theories on January 6, 2021. However, not even the NLG Brief is reckless enough to assert that even one speaker on the podium asserted any racist or white supremacist language to the crowd before it. Thus, in the end, the NLG Amici offer nothing to this Court to show that these off duty Represented Officers did anything but attend a politically unpopular rally—under the belief that election fraud caused their favored candidate to lose the election. This is not a crime. This is not white supremacy. This does not lead to extra-judicial racist arrests and deaths. -13- The politically accountable leaders of Seattle’s democratic institutions established the OPA to investigate claims of misconduct and make determinations. Here the OPA found the Represented Officers’ lawful off duty attendance was within their First Amendment rights—even as those rights may be more narrow for public employees and even narrower for police officers. Perhaps before filing their inflammatory brief, the NLG Amici should have reflected on the OPA Summary’s principled assessment of what the Represented Officers actually did and the principled reason why no misconduct was found: However, absent any acts on their part that were illegal, that the officers attended this rally is absolutely protected by the Constitution. These officers were entitled to exercise their freedom of expression and to assemble. That they did so in a manner contrary to the majority view in Seattle does not alter this view. This is the case even if I, as the decider in this matter, disagree vehemently with everything the rally stood for. Any contrary result would be incorrect–both constitutionally and morally–and would undermine the rule of law that is the bedrock of our society. It -14- would also serve to speed up the current decline of reason, objectivity, and fundamental fairness that plagues America and its contemporary collective discourse. To OPA, that would be simply unpalatable and unacceptable. While this decision may be unpopular with some, OPA believes that it is supported by the law and is consistent with due process. See OPA Summary at p. 21. In the end, there is no “compelling interest” here to root out “white supremacists” by exposing the identities of these Represented Officers because the NLG Amici have not proven that any of these Represented Officers are “white supremacists,” or, even, that the “Stop the Steal” rally, discredited as it may be, was about white supremacy at all. 3. Amici’s Constitutional Analysis Does Not Account For The Facts Before This Court a. The Represented Officers’ Briefed Their Constitutional Argument and Appropriate Standard Contrary to the NLG Brief’s assertion, the Represented Officers briefed their First Amendment Constitutional arguments and standard for this Court to evaluate. -15- First, the Represented Officers’ Complaint clearly alleged a First Amendment Constitutional basis to prevent release of their identity due to their free speech, assembly, association, and petition rights. See CP 12-13, §F “Disclosure of the Except Information Would Violate Plaintiff’s Constitutional Rights”, The First Amendment Constitutional basis which supersedes the PRA was again asserted in Plaintiffs Motion For Temporary Restraining Order. See CP 52-53. Finally, the same basis was once again asserted in the Appellants Opening Brief. See App. Opening Br. at pp. 28-29. The Appellants Opening Brief also included the appropriate standard this Court should apply when evaluating whether First Amendment rights supersede disclosure pursuant the PRA.13 This was, again, repeated in the Appellants’ Supplemental Briefing at pp. 16-18. Thus, it is only the NLG 13 See Appellant’s Opening Brief at p. 28 (“A proposed PRA production infringing on First Amendment rights must enjoined where the party enjoining where the party opposing the production shows “a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of personal information will subject those individuals or groups of individuals to threats, harassment, or reprisals’ that would have a chilling effect on that activity.”). -16- Brief that fails to address the relevant standards and case law—as fully explained below. b. NLG Amici Do Not Discuss the Most Relevant Cases or Properly Explain How A Court Evaluates First Amendment Challenges to a PRA Disclosure i. Doe v. Reed has definite, but limited, value to this Court The NLG Brief discusses Doe v. Reed at length. John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 200, 130 S.Ct. 2811, 2820, 177 L.Ed. 2d 493 (2010). The Represented Officers believe that Doe v. Reed has some applicability to establish that Courts have not hesitated to prohibit PRA disclosures on First Amendment grounds, if those resisting disclosure can show “a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure [of personal information] will subject them to threats, harassment, or reprisals from either Government officials or private parties.” Id. at 200. However, Doe v. Reed is of limited applicability here. Moreover, the NLG Brief ignores what the Doe v. Reed case ruled upon—and what the case forwent ruling upon. -17- The Doe v. Reed Court ultimately determined they were called to decide only a facial challenge to whether the PRA could apply to compelled disclosure of signatory names on all petitions in Washington. In short, the Doe v. Reed Plaintiffs would ultimately seek an injunction barring the secretary of state “from making referendum petitions available to the public.” Id. at 194. The Court stated “[the Plaintiffs] must therefore satisfy our standards for a facial challenge to the extent of that reach.” Id. at 194. The Court ultimately ruled that as a facial challenge the disclosure of “referendum petitions in general” under the PRA “would not violate the First Amendment.” Id. at 202. However, as the NLG Brief fails to discuss, Doe v. Reed did not determine a narrow “as-applied” analysis to the specific petition and referendum R-71 at issue. Indeed, that Court stated: The issue at this stage of the case is not whether disclosure of this particular petition would violate the First Amendment, but whether disclosure of referendum petitions in general would do so….We leave it to the lower courts to consider in the first instance the signers' more focused claim concerning -18- disclosure of the information on this particular petition, which is pending before the District Court. John Doe No. 1 v. Reed at 191 (emphasis added) Even the venerable Sam Reed, the then-Secretary of State in Washington, “acknowledge[d] that plaintiffs may press the narrower challenge [as applied to R-71 specifically] in proceedings pending before the District Court.” Id. at 202. In other words, the actual litigated issue in that case – whether disclosure of R-71’s signatories’ information under the PRA would violate the signatories’ First Amendment Constitutional rights – was never decided by Doe v. Reed. The only issue that Doe v. Reed decided was that there was no broad facial reason to prevent petition signatories’ names—in all situations—from being released to third parties under the PRA.Much of the general discussion in Doe v. Reed discussed the signatories’ rights vis-à-vis a compelling government interest in strengthening the actual referendum process. For example, public disclosure helps to root out fraud, bureaucratic mistakes, -19- and bolsters accountability in the referendum process. Id. at 199.14 The Doe v. Reed Court also acknowledged that many referendums would not engender strong emotions because typical referendum petitions “concern tax policy, revenue, budget, or other state law issues,” which would have much less of an impact upon signatories’ willingness to participate. Id. at 200. Ultimately, Doe v. Reed is of some, but limited, instructiveness here. First, it establishes First Amendment Rights can, in fact, supersede the PRA.Second, it articulates the standard for ruling when First Amendment Rights supersede the PRA disclosure mandate which is described more fully below. ii. Instead of relying on Doe v. Reed, this Court should look to truly instructive First Amendment Expression cases The standard set forth in Doe v. Reed as applied to expressive First Amendment speech is set forth in case law–and 14 Doe v. Reed at 199 (“Public disclosure thus helps ensure that the only signatures counted are those that should be, and that the only referenda placed on the ballot are those that garner enough valid signatures. Public disclosure also promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral process to an extent other measures cannot.”) -20- was addressed in Appellants’ Opening Brief and Appellants Supplemental Briefing.15 Dream Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 384 F.3d 990, 1012 (9th Cir. 2004); Does 1-10 v. Univ. of Washington, 798 F.App’x 1009, 1010 (9th Cir. 2020); Roe v. Anderson, No. 3:14-CV-05810 RBL, 2015 WL 4724739, at *3 (W.D.Wash. Aug. 10, 2015). In Dream Palace, the 9th Circuit recognized the established precedent that adult erotic dancing is a form of First Amendment expression. Dream Palace v. Cty. of Maricopa, 384 F.3d 990, 998 (9th Cir. 2004). As such, while the dancers could be compelled to provide their personal information to Arizona because that did not “inhibit[ ] the ability or the inclination to engage in the protected expression,” that did not mean that Arizona could then turn around provide that information to the public without infringing on those dancers First Amendment rights. Id. at 1010. Dream Palace states as follows: The First Amendment does not permit the county to entertainment put employees adult of 15 See Appellant’s Opening Brief at p. 28; Appellants’ Supplemental Briefing at pp. 16-18. -21- establishments to the choice of either applying for a permit to engage in protected expression in circumstances where they expose themselves to “unwelcome harassment from aggressive suitors and overzealous opponents” of such activity or of choosing not to engage in such activity out of concern for their personal safety. The chilling effect on those wishing to engage in First Amendment activity is obvious. Given the choice with which they are faced, we think it likely that those willing to engage in such activity will decline to do so… Dream Palace at 1012. This same sort of analysis and standard appears in other Courts. While reporting information relating to one’s First Amendment activities to the government does not sufficiently impinge on First Amendment rights pursuant to an O’Brien Constitutional analysis, the government’s subsequent disclosure of that same information to the public pursuant to a public records act request does impermissibly impinge on First Amendment rights.16 See e.g., Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. 16 Regulations that are unrelated to the content of speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny which was first enunciated as a four-step test in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed. 2d 672 (1968). Government regulation of conduct is sufficiently justified if it is within constitutional power of government; if it furthers important or substantial governmental interest; if governmental interest is -22- Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cty., Tennessee, 274 F.3d 377, 395 (6th Cir. 2001) (“Metropolitan Nashville cannot publicly release such private information…Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority”, McIntyre, 514 U.S. at 357, 115 S.Ct. 1511, but it is not a shield from all legitimate regulation”); see also Does 1-10 v. Univ. of Washington, 798 F.App'x 1009, 1010 (9th Cir. 2020) (to prevail on their First Amendment claim, the Doe plaintiffs must show that particular individuals or groups of individuals were engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment and “‘a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of personal information will subject’” those individuals or groups of individuals “‘to threats, harassment, or reprisals’” that would have a chilling effect on that activity.) unrelated to suppression of free expression; and if incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedom is no greater than is essential to furtherance of that interest. Id. -23- Indeed, this exact same standard regarding disclosure has already been accepted under Washington’s Public Records Act: The disclosure of Plaintiffs’ information here would have a similarly unconstitutional chilling effect. As erotic dance studio employees, Plaintiffs are to harassment, shaming, uniquely vulnerable stalking, or worse. Plaintiffs have express concern regarding the enhanced risk that disclosure of their real names and other licensing information might bring. They plausibly claim that they would not have engaged in their profession had they known that their erotic license information could be so easily disclosed to any member of the public. This is exactly the kind of chilling effect that the Ninth in Dream Circuit held Palace. Thus, is the Plaintiffs’ protected under the First Amendment, and it is exempted from disclosure under the PRA.” to be unconstitutional information Roe v. Anderson, No. 3:14-CV-05810 RBL, 2015 WL 4724739, at *3 (W.D.Wash. Aug. 10, 2015). Thus, the standard, already stated in previous briefing, is whether there is a “reasonable probability” that disclosure would subject an objector to “threats, harassment, or reprisals” that would have a “chilling effect.” This is where the Court should focus its attention. -24- c. The Facts Have Changed Since March 2021 & An Undisputable Chilling Effect Exists Today Regardless of the Trial Court’s erroneous legal determinations during the March 10, 2021 preliminary injunction hearing, the facts today are fundamentally different. First, most importantly, the OPA Summary was not completed or published in March 2021. Once published in July 2021, the OPA Summary unequivocally established that the Represented Officers were off duty, lawfully exercising their First Amendment Rights, and committed no misconduct on January 6, 2021. Second, the Represented Officers each submitted sufficient declarations at the preliminary injunction stage related to their various concerns, which were not “extremely vague and self-serving affidavits,” but, considering the timeline, time constraints and need for anonymity fully sufficient.17 However, even considering only the limited amount of new evidence 17 See Appellant’s Reply Brief at pp. 5-6. -25- judicial notice would allow under ER 201, the Represented Officers’ concerns have been amplified by an order of magnitude. This case has been the subject of at least five (5) Seattle Times articles.18 Indeed, the case was deemed so important that the Supreme Court took this case on direct review, bypassing the Court of Appeals, because “whether the identity of these officers should be revealed is an issue of considerable public interest.” See Commissioners Johnston 8/4/21 Ruling at p. 4. Would anyone ever make a political statement, only to have 18 Judge says records ID’ing Seattle officers who attended rally before Capitol riot can be released — but not yet | https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/appeals-court-extends-order-blocking-release-of-identities-of-seattle-officers-who-attended-rally-before-capitol-riot Washington Supreme Court to hear case about Seattle officers who attended D.C. rally before U.S.Capitol attack | https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-supreme-court-to-hear-case-about-seattle-officers-who-attended-d-c-rally-before-u-s-capitol-attack/ Lawyers for Seattle officers who attended Trump rally before U.S.Capitol attack seek to withdraw from public records lawsuit | https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/lawyers-for-seattle-officers-who-attended-trump-rally-before-u-s-capitol-attack-seek-to-withdraw-from-public-records-lawsuit/ Appeals court extends order blocking release of identities of Seattle officers who attended rally before Capitol riot https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/appeals-court-extends-order-blocking-release-of-identities-of-seattle-officers-who-attended-rally-before-capitol-riot/ Two Seattle officers trespassed on U.S.Capitol grounds during riot and should be fired, investigation finds | The Seattle Times https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/two-seattle-officers-trespassed-on-u-s-capitol-grounds-during-riot-and-should-be-fired-investigation-finds/ -26- their names involuntarily splashed across newspapers in their hometown where their political beliefs are “reviled?” Third, the Represented Officers have been targeted by various Amici, including the National Lawyers Guild, who have no qualms stating, without any basis, that these officers are affiliated with “white supremacists” and are a cause of racially motivated extrajudicial arrests, incarceration, and killings. Indeed, the NLG Brief did not even bother to discuss the vindicating OPA Summary, or frankly have the basic decency to make it clear that these Represented Officers did not participate in any insurrection, committed no crimes, but merely attended the lawful rally beforehand. The filing of this reckless NLG Brief in Washington’s highest court, publicly available to anyone on Westlaw, alone constitutes harassment. See Brief of Amicus Curiae The National Lawyers Guild cited at 2021 WL 4804274. Finally, any neutral observer, observing posture of the case today, can predict with “reasonable probability” that the -27- Represented Officers will be subject to further “threats, harassment, or reprisals” which would have a “chilling effect.” The Represented Officers reiterate the bottom line one final time: the OPA Summary has been released. This fully details the OPA investigative process, the evidence gathered and reviewed, the ultimate finding of no misconduct, and the rationale behind that determination. The police officers who did engage in misconduct have been named and fired. The oversight process was transparent and has worked as designed. The neutral observer only needs to ask one question today: Why? Why do the NLG Amici, and the Respondents, still demand the names of the Represented Officers when they already know everything about their activities on January 6, 2021? What exactly are they going to do with the Represented Officers’ names once they receive them? Keep them secret? Hardly.19 19 Similarly, the National Lawyers Guild Seattle Chapter has not updated their website to reflect the OPA Summary has already been released and much of the material in their publicized brief on the site is outdated (and as such is now very misleading standing alone). -28- The Represented Officers’ names will surely be further publicized by NLG Amici, the Respondents, other Amici (who are no less than “24 Media and Transparency Organizations)20,” not to mention the Seattle Times and other local and national news outlets. The Represented Officers’ names will be involuntarily publicized throughout a community that reviles their political beliefs even though the Represented Officers did nothing more than exercise their Constitutional rights while off duty. How could any neutral observer state that this unwanted publicity does not constitute harassment? Likewise, how could this unwanted publicity regarding unpopular views not have an instant chilling effect? V.CONCLUSION The NLG Brief does not establish a “compelling interest.” The NLG Brief employs the wrong analysis of First Amendment https://www.nlg-seattle.org/posts/seattle-chapter-members-represent-nlg-student-member-in-john-and-jane-does-1-6-vs-seattle-pd-opa-sueoka-et-al 20 2021 WL 4804271 (Wash.). -29- challenges to the PRA.Finally, the NLG Briefs fails to acknowledge the “reasonable probability” of “harassment and reprisals” that “chills” First Amendment expression—of which the recklessly inflammatory NLG Brief is quite clearly a perfect case-in-point. The Represented Officers’ Constitutional Rights supersede the PRA.Respectfully, as stated in the Supplemental Brief, this Court should reverse the trial court’s order denying the Represented Officers’ request for a preliminary injunction, and remand with instructions to the trial court to enjoin production of the Represented Officers names or identities.
