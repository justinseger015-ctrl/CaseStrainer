LEGAL MEMORANDUM

In the case of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. This landmark decision overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).

Later, in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Court established a woman's legal right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This decision has been one of the most controversial in the Court's history.

More recently, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), the Court upheld most provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate to purchase health insurance.

In Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Most recently, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, 142 S. Ct. 2111 (2022), the Court struck down a New York gun control law that required applicants to show "proper cause" to carry a firearm in public.
