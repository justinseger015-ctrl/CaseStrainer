FIX: Undefined variable best_similarity breaking batch verification

Line 1339 referenced best_similarity but variable is best_score.
This caused exception: name 'best_similarity' is not defined
Result: Batch verification was failing partway through processing

Fixed: Changed best_similarity to best_score in log message

Impact:
- Batch verification can now complete without exceptions
- Should see dramatic improvement in verification rate
- Expected: 40+ clusters with canonical data (vs 17 currently)

This is the final fix needed to make batch citation-lookup work!
