FIX: Add missing citations from clusters to top-level array

ISSUE:
Vendor-neutral citations (like 2017-NM-007) were being extracted and 
clustered correctly, but NOT appearing in the main citations list.

DISCOVERY:
- Citation extracted: ✅
- Clustered with 388 P.3d 977: ✅  
- In top-level citations array: ❌

ROOT CAUSE:
The sync logic only updated EXISTING citations in the top-level array.
If a citation only existed in a cluster (not in the initial extraction),
it would never be added to the main citations list.

This affected vendor-neutral citations which:
- May be extracted during clustering
- Appear in cluster.citations but not in top-level citations[]

SOLUTION:
Modified progress_manager.py cluster sync logic to:
1. Update existing citations (as before)
2. ADD missing citations from clusters to top-level array
3. Log how many citations were added

CODE CHANGE:
```python
if citation_text in citation_map:
    # Update existing citation
    ...
else:
    # NEW: Add missing citation from cluster
    citation_dicts.append(cluster_citation)
    citation_map[citation_text] = cluster_citation
    citations_added += 1
```

EXPECTED RESULT:
User will now see ALL citations including vendor-neutral formats:
- 2017-NM-007 (New Mexico vendor-neutral)
- 388 P.3d 977 (reporter)
- Both in clusters AND main citations array

TESTING:
User's PDF (1034300.pdf) contains Hamaatsa case citation:
- Before: Only 388 P.3d 977 in main list (46 citations)
- After: Both 2017-NM-007 AND 388 P.3d 977 (47 citations)
