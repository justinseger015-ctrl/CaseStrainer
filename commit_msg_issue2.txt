FIX Issue 2: Reduce name truncation by increasing context window

Problem: Case names truncated mid-word or missing beginning
- "agit Indian Tribe" (missing "Upper Sk")
- "Mgmt., LLC" (missing company name)

Solution (unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py):
1. Increased context window from 150 to 400 characters
   - Line 554: Primary extraction context_before = 400
   - Line 1094: Secondary extraction context_size = 400
2. Added logging when truncation detected
   - Warns when names start with lowercase
   - Helps track remaining truncation cases

Impact:
- Larger context captures more text before citations
- Should significantly reduce truncation frequency
- Logging helps identify remaining edge cases

Note: This doesn't eliminate ALL truncation (would need more complex
logic), but should handle the majority of cases where truncation occurs
because the window was too small.

Time: 25 minutes
