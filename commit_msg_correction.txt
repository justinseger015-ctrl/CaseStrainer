Fix parallel citation propagation - keep verified=False, set true_by_parallel=True

CORRECTION to previous commit: Each citation is independently verified.

**What Was Wrong:**
Previous commit incorrectly set verified=True for parallel citations that weren't actually verified.

**Correct Behavior:**
When a cluster has:
- Citation A: verified=True, canonical_name="Smith v. Jones"
- Citation B: verified=False (parallel citation, not independently verified)

Citation B should get:
- verified=False (stays unchanged - not independently verified)
- true_by_parallel=True (indicates relationship to verified parallel)
- canonical_name="Smith v. Jones" (copied from Citation A)
- canonical_date, canonical_url (copied from Citation A)

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `cit.verified = True` assignment (lines 2087, 2094)
- Removed `verification_source = 'parallel_propagation'` assignment
- Added comments explaining verified stays False
- Updated log message to clarify "canonical data" not "verification"

**Key Principle:**
Each citation's verification status is independent. Parallel citations share canonical data but maintain separate verification states.
