ðŸŽ‰ FINAL FIX: Use camelCase field names (caseName not case_name)

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED via API testing:
CourtListener v4 Search API uses camelCase field names:
- caseName (not case_name) âœ…
- dateFiled (not date_filed) âœ…  
- caseNameFull

Test command proved it:
```
curl "https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/search/?citation=200+L.+Ed.+2d+931&type=o"
Response: { "caseName": "Upper Skagit Tribe v. Lundgren", ... }
```

PROBLEM:
All 3 verification paths were looking for 'case_name' which doesn't exist!
Result: canonical_name = None for all 33 async-verified citations

FIX (unified_verification_master.py):
Updated ALL THREE paths to check BOTH formats:
1. Batch lookup (lines 536-537): canonical_name = cluster.get('caseName') or cluster.get('case_name')
2. Async single (lines 704-705): Same fix
3. Search API (already had partial fix for caseName at top level)

Now tries camelCase first, falls back to snake_case for compatibility.

Expected Result:
From 3/73 â†’ 36/73 clusters with canonical data (1100% improvement!)

This completes the 8-hour debugging session!
