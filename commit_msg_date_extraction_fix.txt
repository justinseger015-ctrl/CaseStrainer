FIX: Date extraction incorrectly picking up year from previous citation

USER BUG REPORT:
Two Hamaatsa clusters appearing when they should be one:
- cluster_14_vol2: Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe (2011) - 388 P.3d 977
- cluster_68: Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe (2016) - 2017-NM-007

ACTUAL CITATION IN DOCUMENT:
```
... (2011); Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977, 985 (2016)
```

This is ONE case with year (2016), not two different cases!

ROOT CAUSE:
The _extract_date_from_case_context() function was:
1. Creating context window BEFORE the case name (case_pos - 100)
2. This included "(2011);" from the PREVIOUS citation
3. Finding years in order of appearance
4. Returning (2011) instead of (2016)

OLD LOGIC (WRONG):
```python
context_start = case_pos - 100  # ← Includes previous citation!
context_end = case_pos + len(case_name) + 200
context = text[context_start:context_end]
# Searches for years in context
# Finds: (2011), (2016)
# Returns FIRST: (2011) ❌
```

NEW LOGIC (CORRECT):
```python
# Search AFTER the citation, not before case name
search_start = citation_end  # ← Start after citation
search_end = citation_end + 100
context_after = text[search_start:search_end]

# Respect citation boundaries (semicolon, period)
# Look for (YYYY) pattern immediately after citation
# Only search within current citation's scope
```

FIX STRATEGY:
1. **Look AFTER citation**: Start from citation_end, not before case_name
2. **Respect boundaries**: Stop at semicolons, periods, newlines
3. **Prioritize proximity**: Year within 20 chars of citation gets highest priority
4. **Bounded search**: Don't cross into next citation's territory

EXAMPLE PROCESSING:
```
Input: "... (2011); Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977, 985 (2016)"

For citation: "388 P.3d 977"
  citation_end = position after "977"
  context_after = ", 985 (2016)"
  Found: (2016) ✓
  Distance from citation: < 20 chars ✓
  Result: extracted_date = "2016" ✓
```

CLUSTERING IMPACT:
After fix, both citations get year 2016:
- 2017-NM-007: extracted_date = 2016 ✓
- 388 P.3d 977: extracted_date = 2016 ✓
→ Same cluster_key: "hamaatsa_inc_v_pueblo_of_san_felipe_2016"
→ ONE cluster (correct!)

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
1. Year in parentheses immediately after citation: `977 (2016)` ✓
2. Year after page number: `977, 985 (2016)` ✓
3. Multiple citations in sequence: Respects semicolon boundaries ✓
4. Bare year without parens: Accepted only if very close (< 30 chars) ✓

FILE MODIFIED:
- src/unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py: _extract_date_from_case_context()

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Hamaatsa citations now cluster together
- Reduced false clustering from year contamination
- Better handling of serial citations with different years
- More accurate year extraction overall
