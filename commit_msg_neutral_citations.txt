Add support for neutral/public domain citations (e.g., 2017-NM-007)

Root Cause:
New Mexico and other states use official neutral citation formats like
"2017-NM-007" which were not being recognized as citations. Instead,
they were being treated as part of the case name.

Example Issue:
- Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977"
- BEFORE: Extracted case name included "2017-NM-007"
- Citation "2017-NM-007" was not recognized
- Not clustered with "388 P.3d 977" as parallel citations

The Fix:

1. Added neutral citation patterns for 8 states:
   - New Mexico: 2017-NM-007 (also NMCA for Court of Appeals)
   - North Dakota: 2017 ND 123
   - Oklahoma: 2017 OK 123
   - South Dakota: 2017 SD 123
   - Utah: 2017 UT 123
   - Wisconsin: 2017 WI 123
   - Wyoming: 2017 WY 123
   - Montana: 2017 MT 123

2. Updated case name cleaning patterns to strip neutral citations
   from extracted case names

Expected Result:
- "2017-NM-007" recognized as a citation ✅
- Clustered with "388 P.3d 977" as parallel citations ✅
- Extracted case name: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe" ✅
- Both citations verified against same case ✅

Impact:
- Improved citation coverage for neutral citation states
- Proper clustering of official and regional reporter citations
- Cleaner case name extraction

Tested with: Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe case
