PLAINTIFFS' MOTIONS IN LIMINE
Plaintiffs, STEPHANIE WADSWORTH and MATTHEW WADSWORTH, by and
through their undersigned counsel, hereby move this Honorable Court for an Order in limine to
exclude the following from evidence and from any statement or argument during the trial. These
Motions are made pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rules 401, 402, and 403,
as well as the local rules of this Court and the Amended Scheduling Order (Doc. 78).

[... rest of the document text ...]

LEGAL STANDARD
Motions in limine are utilized to exclude prejudicial or irrelevant evidence before it is
presented to the jury. The Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 401, 402, and 403,
govern the admissibility of evidence.

1. Relevance (FRE 401 & 402): Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. Relevant
evidence is defined as evidence that makes a fact more or less probable than it
would be without the evidence. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.

2. Prejudicial Impact (FRE 403): Even relevant evidence may be excluded if its
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,
