CRITICAL FIX: Add neutral citations to priority extraction list

ROOT CAUSE (FINALLY FOUND!):
Neutral citation patterns were added to self.citation_patterns dict,
BUT they were NOT in the priority_patterns list. This meant they were
only extracted in the general loop AFTER priority patterns had already
matched, causing them to be missed or extracted incorrectly.

The Problem Flow:
1. Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977"
2. Priority extraction finds: "388 P.3d 977" ✅
3. "2017-NM-007" NOT in priority list, not extracted yet ❌
4. Case name extraction for "388 P.3d 977" looks backward
5. Doesn't see "2017-NM-007" as a citation boundary (not extracted yet!)
6. Includes it in the context
7. Result: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007" ❌

The Fix:
Added all neutral citation patterns to the priority_patterns list:
- neutral_nm (New Mexico: 2017-NM-007)
- neutral_nd (North Dakota: 2017 ND 123)
- neutral_ok (Oklahoma)
- neutral_sd (South Dakota)
- neutral_ut (Utah)  
- neutral_wi (Wisconsin)
- neutral_wy (Wyoming)
- neutral_mt (Montana)

Expected Flow Now:
1. Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977"
2. Priority extraction finds: "2017-NM-007" ✅, "388 P.3d 977" ✅
3. Both extracted as separate citations
4. Case name extraction for "2017-NM-007":
   - Context: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe"
   - Extracted: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe" ✅
5. Case name extraction for "388 P.3d 977":
   - Context stops at "2017-NM-007" boundary
   - Gets name from clustering with "2017-NM-007" ✅
6. Both citations clustered together as parallels ✅

This completes the neutral citation support (attempt #3).

Previous attempts:
1. Added patterns to citation_patterns dict ✅
2. Added patterns to strict_context_isolator ✅
3. Added patterns to priority_patterns list ✅ (THIS FIX)
