The  Motion  will  be  heard  by  the  Honorable  Scott  P.  Klosterman  at  the  United  States 

District Court for the District of Wyoming, 2120 Capitol Avenue Cheyenne, WY 82001, and on a 

date and time to be set by the Court. 

In accordance with this Court’s Local Rule 7.1(b)(1)(a), the undersigned certifies that legal 

counsel  for  Defendants  has  in  good  faith  conferred  with  legal  counsel  for  Plaintiffs  on  these 

motions. 

INTRODUCTION 

This case arises from a catastrophic incident involving the explosion and subsequent fire 

of a defective hoverboard, specifically a Jetson Plasma Iridescent Hoverboard, purchased by the 

Plaintiffs  from  Walmart.  On  February  1,  2022, 

the  hoverboard’s  lithium-ion  battery 

malfunctioned, causing it to ignite and subsequently leading to significant property damage and 

serious  burn  injuries  to  Stephanie  Wadsworth  and  Weston  Wadsworth.  All  Plaintiffs  suffered 

significant emotional and psychological trauma.  Plaintiffs  have sued  Defendants  Walmart,  Inc. 

and  Jetson  Electric  Bikes,  LLC  for  their  roles  in  designing,  manufacturing,  marketing,  and 

distributing the defective product. The Defendants deny Plaintiffs' allegations and contend that the 

fire originated outside of the home, arguing that their product was not defective. 

LEGAL STANDARD 

Motions in limine are utilized to exclude prejudicial or irrelevant evidence before it is 

presented to the jury. The Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 401, 402, and 403, 

govern the admissibility of evidence. 

1.  Relevance (FRE 401 & 402): Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. Relevant 
evidence  is  defined  as  evidence  that  makes  a  fact  more  or  less  probable  than  it 
would be without the evidence. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. 

2.  Prejudicial  Impact  (FRE  403):  Even  relevant  evidence  may  be  excluded  if  its 
probative  value  is  substantially  outweighed  by  the  danger  of  unfair  prejudice, 

2 

 
 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 3 of 9

confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Courts have consistently held that 
evidence with a high potential for prejudice should be excluded to ensure a fair trial. 

Additionally,  Wyoming  case  law  reinforces  these  principles.  In Wyoming  v.  U.S. 

Department of Energy, 2006 WL 3801910 (D. Wyo. 2006), the court emphasized the importance 

of preventing jury confusion and undue prejudice. In Holland v. Keller, 2018 WL 2446162 (D. 

Wyo. 2018), the court ruled that inflammatory evidence should be excluded, reinforcing the need 

to maintain a fair and impartial trial environment. Further, United States v. Hargrove, 2019 WL 

2516279  (D.  Wyo.  2019),  reiterated  that  evidence  likely  to  cause  unfair  prejudice  should  be 

excluded  if  it  outweighs  its  probative  value.  Similarly,  Meyer  v.  City  of  Cheyenne,  2017  WL 

3461055 (D. Wyo. 2017), highlighted that the use of terms that could unduly influence a jury’s 

perception of a party should be excluded to preserve the integrity of the trial process. Evidence is 

unfairly  prejudicial  if  it  has  “an  undue  tendency  to  suggest  [a]  decision  on  an  improper  basis, 

commonly,  though  not  necessarily,  an  emotional  one.”  U.S.  v.  Caraway,  534  F.3d  1290,  1301 

(10th Cir. 2008)(quoting Rule 402 adv. comm. notes). 

ARGUMENT 

I.  PLAINTIFFS’  MOTION  IN  LIMINE  #1:  Evidence  or  commentary  regarding 

“smoking shed”. 

Throughout  this  litigation,  Defendants  have  made  it  a  point  to  refer  to  the  yellow  shed 

outside  of  the  boy’s  bedroom  window  as  the  "smoking  shed".  So  much  so,  that  every  one  of 

Defendants’ experts used the term smoking shed throughout their reports and deposition testimony. 

The shed was not manufactured as a smoking shed, it was not named a smoking shed, and it is not 

sold  as a smoking  shed.  It  is  obvious that Defendants’ use of the term  smoking shed, at  every 

opportunity,  is  only  intended  to  exacerbate  the  sensibilities  of  a  jury  to  evoke  unnecessary 

emotional responses and biases from them, with the result being their inevitable inability to make 

3 

 
 
 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 4 of 9

a fair and impartial decision based on the facts of the case. Stating that the Plaintiffs used the shed 

from time to smoke and shield themselves from the harsh weather is not the same as labeling it a 

smoking shed. The term does not pertain to the core issues of this case concerning the liability of 

Defendants for the alleged defects in the hoverboard that caused the catastrophic injuries to the 

Plaintiffs. Furthermore, the identification of the shed as a "smoking shed" is not necessary for the 

Defendants to establish their defense that the fire originated from that location. Therefore, it should 

be  deemed  irrelevant.  The  prejudicial  effect  of  this  term  far  exceeds  any  potential  relevance  it 

might  have,  warranting  its  exclusion.  The  use  of  terms  that  could  unduly  influence  a  jury’s 

perception of a party should be excluded to preserve the integrity of the trial process. Meyer v. City 

of Cheyenne, 2017 WL 3461055 (D. Wyo. 2017). Allowing such evidence would run afoul of the 

safeguards set forth in Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, and 403. As such, any reference to 

“smoking shed” by Defendants, their counsel, their experts, and all other witnesses must be strictly 

prohibited.  

II.  PLAINTIFFS’  MOTION  IN  LIMINE  #2:  Exclusion  of  evidence  or  commentary 
regarding an “improperly discarded cigarette” causing or contributing to cause the 
underlying fire. 

Any  evidence  or  commentary  regarding  an  improperly  discarded  cigarette  allegedly 

starting  the  fire  must  be  precluded,  as  there  is  no  actual  physical  or  testamentary  evidence  to 

support  this  claim.  Defendants’  own  experts  agree.  Deposition  of  Filas  at  pg.  79:4-19,  Ex.  A; 

Deposition  of  Gorbett  at  61:8-62:1  and  126:16-22,  Exhibit  B.  Allowing  such  commentary, 

argument,  or  attempt  to  introduce  testimony  regarding  this  hypothetical  theory  is  the  type  of 

impermissible  stacking  of  inferences  and  uncorroborated  speculation  that  the  Federal  Rules  of 

Evidence intend to protect against. In Benson v. State of Wyoming, 2010 WL 4683851 (D. Wyo. 

2010), the court emphasized that speculative testimony without concrete evidence is inadmissible, 

4 

 
 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 5 of 9

as it can mislead the jury and detract from the substantive issues of the case. The absence of factual 

support for the claim regarding an improperly discarded cigarette necessitates its exclusion under 

the Federal Rules of Evidence. Plaintiffs further rely upon their arguments in the briefs filed with 

their Daubert Motions against Defendants’ experts Filas (Doc. 98) and Gorbett (Doc. 110). For 

these reasons, any reference to an “improperly discarded cigarette” by Defendants, their counsel, 

their experts, or any other witness, including attempts to present such as a potential defense theory 

for causation, must be strictly prohibited. 

III.  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IN LIMINE #3: Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Alcohol 

Use, Abuse or Intoxication. 

Any evidence or commentary regarding Stephanie's alcohol use the morning of the fire, or 

any history of alcohol use or abuse, must be excluded. Defendants have  presented no evidence 

establishing  that  alcohol  played  any  role  in  causing,  or  contributing  to,  this  incident.  Without 

question, allowing such evidence would be extremely prejudicial and would distract the jury and 

promote bias against the Plaintiff. Federal courts have consistently held that testimony regarding 

alcohol  use  is  irrelevant  where  there  is  no  evidence  to  establish  a  causal  link  to  the  incident. 

In Smith v. United States, 2011 WL 2160468 (D. Wyo. 2011), the court ruled that evidence of a 

party's alcohol consumption was inadmissible because it lacked a direct connection to the events 

at issue. Allowing testimony of any alcohol consumption by Stephanie Wadsworth would only be 

intended to influence the jury into deciding the case based upon biases and prejudice, as opposed 

to the relevant facts and evidence in this case. Because introduction of any alcohol evidence or 

commentary is irrelevant and inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402 and 403, it 

must be excluded from trial. 

IV.  PLAINTIFFS’  MOTION  IN LIMINE  #4:  Exclusion of Evidence Regarding House 

Being "De-Energized". 

5 

 
 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 6 of 9

Evidence  or  testimony  suggesting  that  the  house  was  "de-energized"  at  the  time  of  the 

incident  should  also  be  excluded.  The  Defendants'  experts  failed  to  fully  test  and  examine  the 

electrical circuits throughout the entire house, choosing only to rely upon the Bedroom #4 circuit 

to conclude that the entire house was de-energized. The conclusion that therefore the entire house 

must have been de-energized is speculative and based on an assumption with no foundation. The 

court in Wyoming v. U.S. Department of Energy emphasized that evidence without a factual basis 

can mislead the jury and is therefore inadmissible. Plaintiffs have fully set forth this argument in 

briefs supporting their Daubert Motions against Defendants’ experts Strandjord (Doc. 95) and Filas 

(Doc. 98), and would rely upon those arguments for purposes of precluding such evidence from 

trial.  Even  if  relevant,  the  unreliable  nature  of  such  evidence  deems  it  unfairly  prejudicial  and 

highly likely to mislead a jury, in violation of Rule 403. For these reasons, such evidence must be 

excluded. 

V.  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IN LIMINE #5: Exclusion of Testimony from Defendant's 
Economist  Expert  Regarding  Loss  of  Services  Utilizing  Table  182  of  “The  Dollar 
Value of a Day”. 

Testimony from the Defendant's  forensic  economist expert, Charity Rowsey, relating to 

loss of services for Stephanie Wadsworth should be limited to the calculations set forth in Table 

223 of the resource referenced and relied upon by said expert, “The Dollar Value of a Day”. Ms. 

Rowsey admitted in deposition that she relied upon the wrong category, and should have relied 

upon Table 223 which specifically relates to the category of "married women, homemaker, not in 

labor force, spouse employed, all ages, youngest child ages six through twelve.”  Deposition of 

Charity Rowsey at 37:2 – 38:9, Exhibit C. The significance in the change from her original table 

of  reliance  (Table  182)  is  in  the  value  of  a  day,  which  when  calculated  and  applied  to  Mrs. 

Wadsworth  is  significant.  Ms.  Rowsey  must  be  precluded  from  introducing  evidence  that  the 

6 

 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 7 of 9

applicable value of a day, as it relates to loss of services, is anything other than $80, as stated in 

Table 223 and affirmed by Ms. Rowsey to be correct. Any other testimony is incorrect, irrelevant, 

and would mislead the jury. As established in Holland v. Keller, introducing evidence that does 

not pertain directly to the claims at hand can lead to jury confusion and unfair prejudice. For these 

reasons, Defendants must be precluded from introduction of evidence related to loss of services 

that are inconsistent with the daily rate set forth in Table 223 of “The Dollar Value of a Day”. 

VI.  PLAINTIFFS’  MOTION  IN  LIMINE  #6:  Exclusion  of  Cumulative/Duplicative 

Expert Testimony. 

The cumulative/duplicative expert testimony  of Filas, Strandjord and Gorbett  should be 

excluded to prevent confusion and undue prejudice. The experts overlapping opinions on the issues 

of origin and causation must be limited to just one expert opining on those matters. Gorbett in 

particular waded into both areas, clearly duplicating opinions held by Filas. These arguments have 

been fully set forth in briefs supporting Plaintiffs’ Daubert Motions against Defendants’ experts 

Strandjord (Doc. 95), Filas (Doc. 98), and Gorbett (Doc. 110). 

Allowing  multiple  experts  to  testify  on  the  same  matter  can  lead  to  the  risk  of  juror 

confusion  and  the  potential  for  undue  emphasis  on  certain  aspects  of  the  testimony.  In United 

States v. Hargrove, 2019 WL 2516279 (D. Wyo. 2019), the court noted that duplicative expert 

testimony can be excluded under FRE 403 as it may confuse the issues and mislead the jury. The 

court found that presenting multiple opinions on the same issue without clear differentiation would 

not aid the jury in its understanding and could instead create unnecessary complexity. For these 

reasons, all duplicative expert testimony must be excluded.  

VII.  PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION IN LIMINE #7: Exclusion of Expert Testimony as set forth 

in Plaintiffs’ Daubert Motions 

Plaintiffs would reallege the bases of their Daubert Motions against Defendants’ experts, 

7 

 
 
 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 8 of 9

Strandjord (Doc. 95), Filas (Doc. 98), and Gorbett (Doc. 110), and would rely upon the arguments 

set forth therein for the conclusion that said expert testimonies are irrelevant, and even if relevant 

are unfairly prejudicial and misleading to a jury, and thus inadmissible under Rules 401, 402 and 

403.  

VIII.  PLAINTIFFS’  MOTION  IN  LIMINE  #8:  Exclusion  of  Evidence  that  Defendants 
product is safe, and that a UL 2272 listing certifies that the product is safe and cannot 
cause injury. 

Throughout multiple depositions, Defendants’ counsel has attempted to establish that the 

subject hoverboard is listed under UL 2272, and that such listing is essentially a certification that 

their product is safe and cannot cause injury or malfunction. In Woods v. BNSF Railway Co., 2016 

WL 165971 (D. Wyo. 2016), the court held that allowing a defendant to present evidence of their 

product's safety or lack of prior incidents could skew the jury's perception and distract from the 

relevant issues at hand. Similarly, in Fitzgerald v. City of New York, 2018 WL 3037217 (S.D.N.Y. 

2018),  the  court  ruled  that  evidence  regarding  a  defendant's  claims  of  safety  and  lack  of  prior 

injuries  could  mislead  the  jury,  resulting  in  unfair  prejudice  against  the  plaintiff.  As  such, 

Defendants  must  be  precluded  from  presenting  argument  or  commentary  that  the  subject 

hoverboard being listed under UL 2272, or any other listing, is synonymous with the hoverboard 

being  certified  as  safe  and  incapable  of  malfunctioning  or  causing  injury.  None  of  Defendants 

experts have testified that to be true. And in fact, evidence exists involving this very Defendant 

(Jetson) that a product being “certified” under UL 2272 does not mean that it cannot be potentially 

dangerous or subject to malfunction (as seen with Jetson’s recall of the Rogue hoverboard).  

CONCLUSION 

For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court grant 

their motions in limine and issue an Order excluding any evidence, argument, or reference to these 

8 

 
Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 9 of 9

matters  during  trial  in  order  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  trial  process  and  to  prevent  undue 

prejudice against the Plaintiffs.
