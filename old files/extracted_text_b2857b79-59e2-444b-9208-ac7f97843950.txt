I.  INTRODUCTION 

The pharmaceutical industry is unlike any other 

commercial enterprise.  It is replete with contradictions; for 

example, while the pharmaceutical industry has prolonged life 

and alleviated suffering for more than a century, it is identified 

in opinion surveys as one of the least trusted entities, right 

alongside nuclear power plants. 1/ And while the pharmaceutical 

industry is one of the riskiest business enterprises in which to 

invest, the general public views “Big Pharma” 2/ as excessively 

profitable. 3/ No other industry in the world demands more 

financial risk than the pharmaceutical industry.  Every new drug 

discovery requires, on average, a financial investment of about 

$1.5 billion and it takes about 14 years before any new drug, 

assuming a new drug is actually developed, can be approved for 

1/  See  Taylor,  “The  Pharmaceutical  Industry  and  the  Future  of  Drug 

2/ “Big Pharma” was coined as a pejorative term to describe the large drug 
manufacturers of the pharmaceutical industry sector.  See Goldacre, Bad 
Pharma, 2013, Fourth Estate, London.   

3/ Taylor, supra.

marketing. 4/ One can certainly appreciate the obstacles 

confronting the highly speculative pursuit of new drug 

therapies.  

The Petitioners-Plaintiffs (hereinafter “Plaintiffs” or “the 

Dearingers,” see RAP 10.4(e) 5/) are not unmindful of the 

challenges facing the Respondent-Defendant (hereinafter 

“Defendant” or “Eli Lilly & Co.”), indeed the entire 

pharmaceutical industry, in responding to the perpetual demand 

for better medicines.  Nevertheless, as with any business 

concern operating in the United States, it must operate ethically 

and responsibly;  Defendant clearly has not done so, as this case 

will show. 

Plaintiffs herein will demonstrate for the Court that 

Defendant had foreknowledge that its product has a dangerous

why-its-so-difficult/ (last visited August 18, 2021). 

5/ RAP 10.4(e) provides in pertinent part:  “.  .  . It promotes clarity to use 
the  designations  used  in  the  lower  court,  [or]  the  actual  names  of  the 
parties  .  .  ..”

side-effect but chose to conceal that foreknowledge from, not 

only the public at large, but from the prescribing physicians as 

well; Defendant did so because it knew that its tortuous conduct 

would be sheltered from any legal consequences by the learned 

intermediary doctrine (hereinafter “LID”). 6/ Defendant has 

abused the special status bestowed upon it by the courts of this 

nation with the advent of the LID.   

Perhaps many of the criticisms directed toward the 

pharmaceutical industry are warranted.  Cases such as this 

should merit an exception to the LID. 

II. QUESTION CERTIFIED TO THE SUPREME COURT 

To assist in determining whether the Defendant is 

entitled, under Washington law, to application of the LID as a 

defense, United States District Judge John C. Coughenour has 

6/ In this brief the terms LID and LIR (learned intermediary rule) are used 
interchangeably.

certified, pursuant to RCW 2.60.020 (1965), the following 

question to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington:  

Is  a  manufacturer,  that  promotes  a  prescription 
drug through “direct-to-consumer” marketing, still 
exempt from warning the consumer of that drug’s 
the  “Learned 
dangerous  side  effects  under 
Intermediary  Doctrine”  adopted  by  the  State  of 
Washington  in  Terhune  v.  A.H.  Robins  Co.,  577 
P.2d 925 (Wash. 1978)? 7/ 

Eli Lilly and Company has invoked the LID as a defense to 

shield itself for its refusal to warn consumers and physicians 

about the dangerous side effects of its product Cialis.  

III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 

This Court reviews certified questions of law de novo. 

Frias v. Asset Foreclosure Servs., Inc., 181 Wn.2d 412, 420, 

334 P.3d 529, 533 (2014), citing Carlsen v. Global Client 

7/  Judge  Coughenour  added  the  following:  “The  Court  does  not  intend 
Plaintiffs’  framing  of  the  question  to  restrict  the  Washington  Supreme 
Court’s  consideration  of  any  other  issues  that  it  determines  are  relevant. 
Moreover,  the  Washington  Supreme  Court  may,  in  its  discretion, 
reformulate the question in whatever manner it finds most appropriate. See 
Affiliated  FM  Ins.  Co.  v.  LTK  Consulting  Servs.  Inc.,  556  F.3d  920,  922 
(9th Cir. 2009).” Order of July 6, 2021 (Dkt. No. 28).

Solutions, LLC, 171 Wn.2d 486, 493, 256 P.3d 321 (2011).  

The Court considers the questions presented “in light of the 

record certified by the federal court.” Id.  Because the federal 

court has certified the question here in connection with a 

motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief 

may be granted pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), all facts 

alleged in the complaint must be accepted as true.  Frias, supra, 

citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 127 

S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). 

IV. STATEMENT OF THE CASE 

This case comes before the Court on a certified question 

from the United States District Court for the Western District of 

Washington.  The underlying civil action was initiated by 

Plaintiffs 8/ under that court’s diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 

1332(a)(1) (Defendant is an Indiana Corporation), and under 

Washington’s Products Liability Act, RCW 7.72 et seq. 

8/ Dearinger v. Eli Lilly & Co., No. C21-00060-JCC (W.D.Wash. 2021).

(hereinafter “WPLA”).  Mr. Dearinger was injured by a 

prescription drug manufactured and marketed by the Defendant.  

A.  Factual Background 

(1) Discovery of the Phosphodiesterase-5 Enzyme 
      Inhibitor 

The first phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor 

(hereinafter “PDE5 inhibitor”) was discovered quite by accident 

in 1989 by the Pfizer Corporation 9/ while seeking a drug 

therapy to treat angina pectoris. 10/  While the PDE5 inhibitor 

Pfizer tested failed as an effective treatment for angina pectoris, 

“a very observant nurse” discovered that some of the male 

subjects were embarrassed by an unexpected benefit 11/ of the 

PDE5 inhibitor being tested. 12/ 

9/ The Pfizer Corporation is not involved with this litigation. 

10/Goldstein, Burnett, Rosen; The Serendipitous Story of Sildenafil: An 
Unexpected Oral Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction, 2019, Sexual 
Medicine Reviews. 7 (1): 115–128. 

11/  Inasmuch  that  maintaining  decorum  is  essential  to  the  orderly 
administration of justice, Plaintiffs will endeavor to respect the dignity of 
this honorable Court and refrain from stating the obvious. 

6 

 
 
 
                                           
 
 
The PDE5 inhibitor was patented by Pfizer under the 

generic name Sildenafil in 1996 and was approved by the Food 

and Drug Administration (hereinafter “FDA”) for sale to the 

public as a treatment for erectile dysfunction (hereinafter “ED”) 

on March 27, 1998 under the registered trademark Viagra®. 

(2) The Marketing of Cialis 

Defendant patented its own version of the PDE5 inhibitor 

called Tadalafil, which was approved by the FDA on November 

21, 2003 (Drug Application #021368) for manufacture and sale 

under the registered trademark Cialis® 13/ (the prescription drug 

at issue in this case) also for the treatment of ED. 14/   

12/ Goldstein, supra. 

13/ The most notable distinction between Viagra and Cialis is the duration 
of  the  therapeutic  effectiveness,  which  is  36  hours  for  Cialis  and  only  5 
hours for Viagra.   

14/ The FDA later approved Cialis® for the treatments of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) on May 22, 2009 and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) on October 6, 2011. 

7 

 
 
                                                                                                         
 
  
 
 
Based upon the available cultural research, Defendant 

knew that the PDE5 inhibitor could possibly become the most 

sought-after life-style drug ever discovered, 15/ and in view of 

the inordinately high importance our generation places upon 

connubial relations, 16/ Defendant wasted no time in announcing 

to its shareholders that it was beginning an aggressive new 

“direct-to-consumer” (hereinafter “DTC”) advertising 

campaign, independent of prescribing physicians.   

In answering the question:  

How  can  [Eli]  Lilly  [and  Co.]  do  justice  to  so 
many new products all at once? And, with so many 
launches, can you afford to grow earnings in 2004? 

Defendant answered thus: 

15/ A 1994 study estimated that 10-20 million people in America suffer 
from impotence.  Feidman, HA, Goldstein, I. & Hatzfchrfstou, D.G., 
Impotence and its medical and psychosocial correlates: results of the 
Massachusetts male aging study, 1994, Journal of Urology, 151, 54-61. 

16/ “Sex is a man's second strongest instinct, after that of survival. This 
means that if a man's life is not immediately imperiled, the next thing he 
will automatically think of is sex. This is a fundamental reality of life and 
explains why sexual impotence or erectile dysfunction is associated with 
so much of distress, guilt, shame and embarrassment.” Trivedi, J.K.,

Psychiat, 40 (3), 199-200,

This year, we are investing aggressively to market 
Cialis  in  the  U.S.  and  will  have  additional  new

Nathanial Hawthorne’s 1837 short story collection Twice-Told Tales: “Dr.

Side Effect of Cialis 

Reports began to surface from all over the world that the 

PDE5 inhibitor is not nearly as safe as the pharmaceutical 

industry has portrayed in its DTC advertising; case studies 

reveal that PDE5 inhibitors cause ICH.  

In as early as 2001 a letter was published in the Journal 

of Neurology by four Italian neurologists documenting a 67 

year-old dentist who suffered an ICH after ingesting a 25 mg 

Viagra® tablet.  Monastero, Pipia, Camarda; Intracerebral

In  2005 

researchers 

from 

the  Neurology 

and 

Neurosurgery  Departments  of  the    Mayo  Clinic  in  Rochester, 

Minnesota  reported  that  a  59  year-old  man  suffered  an  ICH 

after  taking  a  10  mg  Cialis®  tablet.    Steeves,  Jones,  Ecker;

 In 2006 a response to the article: McGee HT, Egan RA, 

Clark WM. Visual field defect and intracerebral hemorrhage 

associated with use of vardenafil (Levitra). Neurology 2005; 

64:1095–1096, a Dr. Hellstrom took issue with the causality of 

the subject’s ICH: 

The issue of causality and association of vardenafil 
with  ICH  may  be  difficult  to  ascertain  in  this 
patient  in  the  McGee  article  because  of  the 
following  confounders:  although  rare,  ICH  has 
been  reported  for  all  3  PDE-5  inhibitors;  the 
specific  doses  and  duration  of  therapy  with  the 
previously used PDE -5 inhibitor (sildenafil) were 
not  given;  although  no  history  of  drug  use  was 
mentioned, a toxicology screen was not conducted; 

when  ingesting  PDE5  inhibitors  that  should  have  been  included  in  the 
Defendant’s DTC advertisements and warning literature.

and  a  multiplicity  of  risk  factors  are  involved  in 
the etiology of ICH3.  

To that statement the authors responded: 

We  appreciate  Dr.  Hellstrom’s  response  to  our 
article1  and  agree  with  all  of  his  points.  When 
assessing whether or not a side effect is related to a 
medication,  timing  of  onset  of  symptoms  in 
relation  to  ingestion  of  drug  is  important  in 
addition  to  whether  symptoms  recur  when  the 
patient  takes  the  drug  again.  Today,  serious  side 
effects  of  medications  are  difficult  to  prove  since 
patients  are  reluctant  to  rechallenge  themselves 
with a drug they believe was implicated in causing 
their  symptoms.  Therefore,  we  are  left  with  the 
timing of onset of symptoms to ingestion.   

Although  we,  the  authors,  are  at  a  loss  to 
hypothesize  a  mechanism  of  causation  of  ICH  in 
our patient,  our intention  was to  alert  the medical 
community  to  this  possible  association  through 
publication.

To summarize: Defendant knew as early as the year 

2001, two years before the FDA approved Cialis, that ingestion 

of PDE5 inhibitors could result in ICH. 

(4)  Plaintiffs’ Injury 

Because Defendant refused to warn the public (or even 

warn prescribing physicians) that Cialis can cause an ICH, Mr. 

Dearinger unknowingly ingested Cialis and two hours later 

suffered an ICH which left him hemiplegic with left side 

paralysis; Mr. Dearinger has lost the use of his left arm and leg. 

Plaintiffs filed a civil complaint against Eli Lilly & Co. 

alleging negligent design, negligent failure to warn, breach of 

warranty, and a common law claim for Mrs. Dearinger’s loss of 

consortium.  Eli Lilly & Co. countered with a motion to

dismiss, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 21/ citing the LID as 

its defense. 

V.  ARGUMENT 

A.  Origin of the Learned Intermediary Doctrine 

The LID finds its origin in the common law.  Fifty-five 

(55) years ago the LID was born to a panel of the Eighth Circuit 

in the case of Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Cornish, 370 F.2d 82, 85 

(8th Cir.1966) 22/ (“the purchaser's doctor is a learned 

intermediary between the purchaser and the manufacturer” 

21/ Insofar as the certified question here is in connection with a motion for 
dismissal for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted 
pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), all facts alleged in the complaint must 
be accepted as true. Frias v. Asset Foreclosure Servs., Inc., supra. 

22/ The 1966 Eighth Circuit panel was comprised of Circuit Judge Charles 
Joseph Vogel, born in 1898, Circuit Judge Pat Mehaffy, born in 1904, and 
District Judge Edward Joseph McManus of the Northern District of Iowa 
sitting by designation, born in 1920. All three judges lived during a time 
when the decision to take a prescription drug was “exclusively a matter for 
medical  judgment.”    Schwartz,  Consumer-Directed  Prescription  Drug 
Advertising and the Learned Intermediary Rule, 40 Food Drug Cosm. L.J. 
135, 136 (1985).

infancy; televisions were in fewer homes and the television 

commercial was a relatively new concept. 24/ Advertising of 

prescription drugs on television was inconceivable 1966.  In 

those days drug companies marketed their prescription drugs 

only to licensed physicians because only licensed physicians 

were aware of the existence of most prescriptions medications, 

thus advertising dollars were focused on the audience that made 

23/ The Eighth Circuit flirted with the idea of exempting drug manufactures 
from  strict  liability  as  early  as  1925,  yet  found  the  defendant  drug 
company in that case nevertheless liable in Hruska v. Parke, Davis & Co., 
6 F.2d 536 (8th Cir.1925). But the first actual case in the nation where a 
drug manufacturer was found to have fulfilled its duty to warn by warning 
only  the  physician  was  in  1948  with  Marcus  v.  Specific  Pharms.,  191 
Misc.  285,  77  N.Y.S.2d  508  (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1948),  as  noted  by  Odgers  v. 
Ortho  Pharm.  Corp.,  609  F.Supp.  867,  873  n.  12  (E.D.Mich.1985)  and 
Larkin v. Pfizer, Inc., 153 S.W.3d 758, 762 (Ky.2004). 

24/  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  adopted  Rules  and 
Standards for commercial broadcast television effective as of July 1, 1941 
which  permitted  the  world’s  first  “television  commercial”  that  was  aired 
on the same day. A ten second spot was purchased for $9 by the Bulova 
Watch  Company  and  played  in  the  New  York  City  market  immediately 
before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Phillies on 
the WNBC Network (owned by RCA) at 2:29 p.m. On that simplistic first 
TV  commercial  an  audio  message  “America  runs  on  Bulova  time”  was 
heard with a video of a still image of a clock face reading “8:00” with the 
inscription  “Bulova Watch Time” superimposed over a still image of the 
continental United States.

physicians. 

Everything changed twenty years later when Big Pharma 

learned that profits could increase through DTC advertising 

which, in essence, bypasses the prescribing physician by 

diverting their advertising dollars away from the family doctor 

and targeting the patient directly:

Prescription drugs have entered a new era making the 

LID obsolete.  While the LID may have been valid at one time, 

it is no longer because drug companies now utilize DTC 

advertising where their drugs are now being advertised in 30 

second television commercials directed straight to the patient, 

and thereby bypassing prescribing physicians.   

(1) Changes To The Doctor-Patient Relationship 

As Defendant is undoubtedly aware, Health Management 

Organizations (HMOs) and managed care have greatly reduced 

the amount of time the family physician spends with each 

patient. 

[B]ecause  managed  care  has  reduced  the  time 
allotted  per  patient,  physicians  have  considerably 
less  time  to  inform  patients  of  the  risks  and 
benefits  of  a  drug.  Stolberg,  Faulty  Warning 
Labels  Add  to  Risk  in  Prescription  Drugs,  N.Y. 
Times, June 4, 1999, at A27. "In a 1997 survey of 
1,000  patients,  the  F.D.A.  found  that  only  one-
third  had  received  information  from  their  doctors 
about the dangerous side effects of drugs they were 
taking." Ibid.

Perez v. Wyeth Lab. Inc., 161 N.J. 1, 24, 734 A.2d 1245, 1255 

(1999).  

When the Supreme Court of New Jersey accepted the 

DTC advertising exception to the LID, it listed four premises 

upon which the LID was based: 

(1)  reluctance  to  undermine  the  doctor  patient-
relationship;  (2)  absence  in  the  era  of  "doctor 
knows  best"  of  need  for  the  patient's  informed 
consent;  (3)  inability  of  drug  manufacturer  to 
communicate with patients; and (4) complexity of 
the subject; are all (with the possible exception of 
the  direct-to-consumer

advertising of prescription drugs.

Perez, supra.  In summary, the reasons why courts have 

adopted the LID in the first place have all but disappeared with 

the advent of DTC advertising. "Consumer-directed advertising 

of pharmaceuticals thus belies each of the premises on which 

the learned intermediary doctrine rests." State ex rel. Johnson & 

Johnson v. Karl, 220 W.Va. 463, 647 S.E.2d 899, 910 (2007).

(2) Increase of DTC Advertising 

In following the reasoning of New Jersey in Perez v. 

Wyeth Lab. Inc., supra, the Supreme Court of West Virginia 

rejected the LID outright in State ex rel. Johnson & Johnson v. 

Karl, supra.  The West Virginia Supreme Court noted the 

unmistakable spike in advertizing dollars spent by drug 

manufacturers when the FDA offered them guidance on how to 

market directly to consumers: 

In 1997, the FDA issued draft guidelines intended 
to  supplement  the  regulations  regarding  broadcast 
advertisements.  These  guidelines  led  to  a  rapid 
informative 
proliferation  of  a  newer,  more

The “Restatement (Second)” offers the example of 

Pasteur’s rabies vaccine “which not uncommonly leads to very 

serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.” 

Because the side-effects of the vaccine are an acceptable 

alternative to a painful death, on balance the vaccine is 

preferable despite the side-effects.  

Since  the  disease  itself  invariably  leads  to  a 
dreadful  death,  both  the  marketing  and  the  use  of 

27 

 
 
the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the 
unavoidable  high  degree  of  risk  which  they 
involve. 

Ibid.  

Under Washington law, in order to fit the legal definition 

of “unavoidably unsafe,” and thus be eligible for the LID as a 

defense, a drug must meet all four of the criteria listed under 

Comment k of Section 402A of Restatement (Second) of Torts, 

adopted by this Court in Terhune v. A. H. Robins Co., 90 

Wash.2d 9, 577 P.2d 975 (1978): 

(1)  A showing that the product is incapable of being 

made safe for its intended and ordinary use;  (2)  That the 

benefits of the product justify its marketing and use despite the 

unavoidable risks;  (3)  That the product is properly prepared 

and marketed, and(4) That the product is accompanied by 

proper directions and warnings. 

Cialis fails on at least two criteria of Comment k:  Cialis 

is a recreational “life-style” drug, the kind mentioned by the 

Supreme Court of New Jersey: 

28 

 
 
[W]hen  one  considers  that  many  of  these  "life-
style" drugs or elective treatments cause significant 
side  effects  without  any  curative  effect,  increased 
consumer  protection becomes  imperative, because 
these  drugs  are,  by  definition,  not  medically 
necessary. 

Perez v. Weyth Labs Inc., supra, 734 A.2d. at 1257 (quotation 

marks in original).  The benefits of Cialis, as a 100% 

recreational “life-style” drug, 30/ do not justify its risk of ICH.  

Moreover, as observed by four neurology professors reporting 

in the journal Missouri Medicine: 

FDA  warns  against  possible  cardiovascular 
adverse  reactions,  hearing  loss,  hypotension,  and 
priapism, however does not warn that ICH may be 
[sic] possible side effect. 

Lucchese, Dhaliwal, Kaur, Qi; A Case of Recurrent Lobar 

Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the Setting of Phosphodiesterase-

5 Inhibitor Use, Missouri Medicine, 2019 116:5. (Appendix 27-

30)(emphasis added).   

30/ There are adequate substitutes for the other FDA approved uses for 
Cialis (see note 14 at page 7): a variety of alpha blockers can treat BPH, 
and endothelin receptor antagonists can treat PAH.   

29 

 
 
 
                                           
Thus Cialis does not fit the category of drugs embodied 

within the scope of Comment k to qualify as “unavoidably 

unsafe.”  In any event, assuming that DTC advertising was not 

involved, Defendant is nevertheless ineligible for application of 

the LID as a defense.  Cialis does not fit the exception provided 

by Comment k, of Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of 

Torts.  

B.  Why the Learned Intermediary Doctrine Must Be 

            Re-examined  

(1) The LID Encourages Irresponsible Behavior 

Many courts and commentators have viewed commerce 

as a flowing “stream,” 31/ a metaphor to represent the process 

31/ The concept perhaps first began with Associate Justice Oliver Wendell 
Holmes, Jr. writing for a unanimous court, as he metaphorically viewed 
commerce in the abstract as a “current” to describe the movement of a 
product through interstate commerce,  Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 
U.S. 375, 399, 25 S.Ct. 276, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905)(a purchase of cattle at 
the local stockyard affects the interstate continuum of trade, thereby 
invoking the Sherman Act to break-up the horizontal monopoly of the 
“Beef Trust” in accordance with the goals of the T. Roosevelt 
Administration; “the current thus existing is a current of commerce among 
the States”) as did Chief Justice (and former president) William Howard 
Taft nearly two decades later in Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U.S. 495, 516, 42 

30 

 
 
 
                                           
whereby a product is manufactured, then passed onto a broker, 

then the wholesaler, then retailer, and eventually to the ultimate 

consumer of the product.  “Stream of commerce” is an apt 

description befitting a time predating the automobile.  

Plaintiffs, however, suggest that commerce is more aptly 

described as a multilane superhighway, something unknown in 

1905 because there were no automobiles then. 

On the “highway” of commerce there are varied lanes 

separated by the repercussions of the buying decisions 

involved.  There are lanes reserved for impulse buying, such as 

a new flavor of chewing gum, where the time required for the 

decision to purchase can be measured in milliseconds; retailers 

call such purchases “impulse buying” (those items that store 

owners move close to the cash register) where the purchase 

ramifications are de minimus.         

S.Ct. 397, 66 L.Ed. 735 (1922)(“The stockyards and the sales are 
necessary factors in the middle of this current of commerce”).   

31 

 
                                                                                                         
  
Conversely, there is a lane for products that consumers 

may require years to decide whether to purchase.  These 

products include homes, vehicles, cosmetic surgery, etc.  The 

ramifications are long term and sometimes permanent. 

The prescription drug manufactured by the Defendant, 

Cialis, should travel the lane closer to the latter example where 

purchases require much deliberation.  Unfortunately there 

would be fewer sales of Cialis if consumers deliberated on 

whether to purchase a “life-style” drug that carried a possible 

side-effect of ICH.  Thus Defendant “changed lanes” 32/ to be 

closer to the lane reserved for impulsive sales (which explains 

the bikinis, see note 19 at page 10).   

Prescription drugs have twenty (20) years of patent 

protection, which provide only a small window of opportunity 

where drug manufactures can earn maximum profits without 

competition in the marketplace from generic drug makers. 

32/ Our young people like to remind others, those with whom they disagree 
(sometimes their parents), to “stay in your own lane” in order to achieve a 
desired result.  

32 

 
                                           
  
This is Defendant’s annual gross revenue earned from 

sales of Cialis from the time of FDA approval to the present: 33/

Notice the peak from 2016 to the gradual drop in revenue as the 

Cialis patent begins to expire.  Moreover, the main Cialis 

competitor, Viagra, lost its patent five years earlier, thus 

permitting a cheaper generic version of the PDE5 inhibitor into 

the marketplace to drive prices down.

One of the many unintended consequences of the LID is 

that it removes an important incentive for powerful drug 

manufacturing corporations to behave responsibly.  

The Federal Government reported in 2006 that the 

pharmaceutical industry had spent more on DTC advertising 

than it had spent on research and development.  34/   

Plaintiffs have demonstrated that Defendant (and other 

drug manufacturers) withheld knowledge of the dangerous side-

effect of ICH when taking PDE5 inhibiters and did so 

deliberately to generate maximum revenue and worry later 

about paying damages.   

 As was observed by a California Appellate Court: 

[T]he manufacturer may find it more profitable to 
treat compensatory damages as a part of the cost of 
doing business rather than to remedy the defect. 

Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co. 119 Cal. App.3d 757, 174 

Cal. Rptr. 348 (1981). 

34/ Government Accounting Office (GAO)- 07-54 Prescription Drugs: 
Improvements Needed in FDA’S Oversight of Direct-To-Consumer 
Advertising 5, 12 (Nov. 2006). 

34 

 
 
 
                                           
 
Perhaps the Defendant and other manufacturers of PDE5 

inhibiters thought it more profitable to keep quiet about ICH 35/ 

and “treat compensatory damages as a part of the cost of doing 

business.”  Grimshaw. 

During the time Defendant enjoyed the privilege of the 

LID, it ventured into a different lane on the highway of 

commerce: the lane reserved for safe (which Cialis certainly is 

not) products requiring little deliberation to purchase, while 

enjoying the windfall profits beneath the protective wing of the 

LID. 

Defendant and other manufactures could not have 

generated such windfall profits marketing PDE5 inhibiters if it 

warned the public and physicians about the side-effect of ICH. 

35/ Defendant stated as much in its 2017 financial reporting: “Because of 
the nature of pharmaceutical products, we could become subject to large 
numbers of product liability claims for these or other products in the 
future, which could require substantial expenditures to resolve and, if 
involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product.”

35 

 
                                           
  
Had the LID not been available as a carte blanche for the 

Defendant to evade the general requirement to warn the public 

of dangerous side-effects, its DTC advertising would have 

included a warning against a possible ICH when ingesting 

Cialis.  With the LID in force Defendant gives little or no 

regard to the potential legal consequences of causing 

debilitating drug injuries with its refusal to warn about the 

danger of ICH, so it yet continues to market Cialis with 

impunity.   

In the case of PDE5 inhibiters, the LID hinders the 

patient-doctor relationship, encourages patients to choose drug-

based solutions over lifestyle-based ones, it reduces the amount 

spent on research and development, and increases spending on 

drugs without a corresponding health benefit. 36/

(2) A DTC Exception to LID Would Not Create a Chilling 
      Effect 

The worst kept secret among the more fierce advocates of 

the LID is the fear that important drug discoveries will no 

longer be forthcoming if the pharmaceutical industry loses the 

financial incentive or freedom to experiment.  Those advocates 

call this a “chilling effect” on the Pharmaceutical Industry’s 

ability to discover new drug therapies. 

Some commentators (that might possibly be on the 

pharmaceutical industry payroll) have sung like troubadours of 

the virtues of the LID and lament over the possibility of a world 

without new drug research if courts take one step toward 

limiting the LID for drug companies that utilize DTC 

advertising. 37/

Consumer Pharmaceutical Advertising on the Learned Intermediary 
Doctrine, (1997), 20 Campbell L. Rev. 113.

Plaintiffs submit that as long as capitalism remains alive 

and well in this country, the profit motive will continue to 

generate entrepreneurship, even within the pharmaceutical 

industry.  “The profit motive is the engine that ensures the 

progress of science." American Geophysical Union v. Texaco 

Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (S.D.N.Y.  1992), aff'd, 60 F.3d 913 

(2nd Cir. 1994).   

C.  This Case Demands Authorizing of Punitive Damages 

Because Defendant has acted to withhold disclosure that 

Cialis can cause ICH, this Court should determine that the 

actions of Defendant were so egregious as to warrant punitive 

damages. 

The United States District Court has broadened the scope 

 of the certified question to include:

determines

VI.  CONCLUSION 

Mapping of the complete human genome marked an 

important milestone in medical discovery. 38/ As a result of that 

achievement, drugs can someday be engineered to fit each 

individual according to his or her own genetic profile.       

As we prepare to cross that threshold we need now, more 

than ever, a robust pharmaceutical industry to meet the 

challenging demands of the twenty-first century.  But that need 

does not override our need for the pharmaceutical industry to 

behave responsibly. 

By limiting the reach of the learned intermediary 

doctrine, this Court will put drug manufactures on notice, that 

those doing business in the State of Washington that “change

no longer enjoy the protection of the LID to market their 

product directly to the public, that they must disclose all and 

every dangerous side effects at the time of their marketing.

lntracerebral 
haemorrhage associated 
with sildenafil citrate 

Received:  15 February 2000 
Received in  revised form: 8 Jun e 2000 
Accepted: 25  July 2000 

Sirs:  Sildenafil is an orally active, 
potent and selective inhibitor of 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), 
an important regulator of cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
in the human corpus cavernosum 
which has recently been introduced 
for  the treatment of erectile dys 
function. Sildenafil acts by increas 
ing the concentration of cGMP in 
the corpus cavernosum smooth 
muscle cells leading to muscle re 
laxation, vasodilatation and penile 
erection [!].Adverse effects in 
clude headache, visual and retinal 
disturbances, dizziness and a 
pupil-sparing third nerve palsy (2, 
5, 7] . We  report a patient who de 
veloped intracerebral haemorrhage 
(ICH)  after sildenafil consumption. 
A 67-year-old dentist was re 
ferred to our clinic in a confusional 
state together with speech, numer 
acy and memory disturbances. 
From the history it appeared that 
5 days before admission, approxi 
mately 30 minutes after the inges 
tion of one tablet of sildenafil 
25 mg, the patient complained of 
headache, confusion and nervous 
ness without improvement in sex 
ual function. One hour after the 
ingestion of the first tablet the 
patient took another 25 mg tablet, 
again without sexual intercourse. 
According to his wife, these symp 
toms increased together with lan 
guage difficulty. The patient was 

admitted to our department 5 days 
later. He had never used sildenafil 
before. The history revealed no ar 
terial hypertension or migraine or 
haemostatic risk factors (e. g. use of 
anticoagulants or antiplatelet 
drugs, thrombolytic treatment), 
history of head trauma, hypercho 
lesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, 
pre-existing cardiovascular disease 
or cerebrovascular episodes such as 
stroke or transient ischaemic at 
tacks. There was no family history 
of cerebral arteriovenous malfor 
mation, intracerebral aneurysms, 
or intracerebral haemorrhages. He 
had a 40-year history of tobacco 
abuse (approximately 15 cigarettes 
a day)  and denied regular alcohol 
intake. He took no other medica 
tions. 

On admission his blood pres 
sure was  140/90 mmHg and pulse 
was 68/min. Neurological examina 
tion showed a right superior 
homonymous quadrantopsia and 
psychiatric examination a dyspho 
retic mood. Ophthalmoscopic ex 
amination was normal. Neuropsy 
chological testing revealed a 
moderate impairment of compre-

signal lesion confined subcortically to the left tempo 
ral  lobe 

hension, naming, reading and writ 
ing with a relative sparing of repe 
tition, acalculia, finger agnosia, 
colour anomia, and discrete in 
volvement of episodic memory. 
Routine blood examination, 
platelet count and coagulation fac 
tors were normal, as well as elec 
trocardiography, and colour-coded 
duplex sonography of extracranial 
vessels. Transcranial colour-coded 
duplex sonography revealed a 
sharply demarcated hypere 
chogenic area confined to  the left 
temporal lobe. Two  days after ad 
mission basal and gadolinium-en 
hanced Tl-/T2-weighted cerebral 
magnetic resonance imaging re 
vealed a large left temporal subcor 
tical haemorrhage with moderate 
surrounding oedema (see Fig. l). 
Although the chance of finding a 
clinically relevant vascular lesion in 
a patient 67 years old is very small, 
we would have liked to have per 
formed cerebral angiography. How 
ever, the patient's wife, informed of 
the potential risk of cerebral an 
giography, refused her consent due 
to her husband's advanced age and 
the presence of a deep lobar ICH. 
The patient was treated with intra 
venous bolus of 1 g/kg mannitol, 
followed by 0.5 g/kg every 4 h for 
7 days. He was discharged 5 days 
later with mild comprehension, 
reading, writing and episodic 
memory deficits, moderate acalcu 
lia, finger agnosia and colour 
anomia. The field defect was still 
present. 

The close temporal relationship 

between sildenafil ingestion and 
onset of the neurological symp-
toms due to  the ICH in a patient 
without a history of cerebrovascu-
lar accident or obvious risk factors 
for ICH suggest that sildenafil was 
causally related to the ICH. Smok-
ing is currently not considered a 
primary risk factor for ICH  [4, 6] . 
Since the symptoms started before 
any attempt at sexua  mtercourse, 
sexual exertion cannot be regarded

as the precipitating factor. Com 
mon adverse effects of sildenafil, 
such as flushing, headache and 
nasal congestion, indicate that va 
sodilatation is not confined to the 
corpus cavernosum [5]. On the 
other hand, the reported occur 
rence of acute myocardial infarc 
tion suggests that the drug may 
also act by redistributing the arter 
ial blood flow, in turn reducing ves 
sel perfusion [3 ]. The reported oc 
currence of headache, dizziness, 
visual disturbances, retinal dys 
function and a pupil-sparing third 
nerve palsy suggest that sildenafil 
also affects brain microvasculature 
regulation [2, 5, 7]. Recently, Bal 
lard et al. [ 1] in an in vitro study 
have shown that sildenafil, in addi 
tion to a selective action on PDE-5, 
may also act on other two PDEs 
(i.e. PDE-1 and PDE-2) which are 
involved in the control of cerebral 
vasculature. In our case a particu 
lar susceptibility to the drug may 
have led to an abnormal, persistent 
vasodilatation of cerebral arteries 
and to an abnormal redistribution 
of arterial brain blood flow. Fur 
thermore, our patient took a sec 
ond 25 mg tablet within 1 h of in 
gestion of the first one, despite the 
manufacturer's advice suggesting 

that the initial sildenafil dose in the 
elderly should be 25 mg. These fac 
tors may have increased the risk of 
a bleeding phenomenon in a sub 
ject with a senescent cerebral cir 
culation. As cerebral angiography 
was not carried out in our patient, 
it remains unclear to what extent 
pre-existing cerebral microvascular 
disease contributed to the onset of 
ICH. However, although less accu 
rate than cerebral angiography, 
brain magnetic resonance imaging 
and transcranial colour-coded du 
plex sonography did not show any 
cerebral malformations. 

In conclusion, our case and the 
frequency of reported vascular ad 
verse effects suggest that sildenaftl 
should be used with caution in the 
elderly, especially when the mini 
mum dose recommended by the 
manufacturer does not improve 
sexual function to first-time users. 
Longitudinal pharmacological 
studies in an elderly population are 
necessary to clarify this issue.

Coital Hemorrhage  of an  Arteriovenous  Malformation after 
Premedication with Tadalafil  (Cialis) 

Thomas  D.L.  Steeves,  MD,*  Lyell K. Jones,  MD,*  Robert D. Ecker,  MD,t 
and Edward M.  Manno, MD* 

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors are widely used in the trea tment of erectile 
dysfunction.  However, the  results  on  the cerebral vasculature are  unknown. Several 
cases of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the setting of PDE 5 inhibitor use have been 
reported. The effect of these agents on the risk of arteriovenous malformation (A VM) 
hemorrhage  is  speculative.  This  report  illustrates  a  possible  association  between 
tadalafil  (Cialis, Lilly ICOS, Indianapolis, IN), a new long-acting PDE 5 inhibitor, and 
A VM  hemorrhage  during coitus. A 59-year-old male suffered a coital intraparenchy 
mal hemorrhage after premedication  with tadalafil.  Angiography and magnetic reso 
nance imaging demonstrated an underlying right temporoparital A VM. The A VM was 
excised,  and the patient made an uneventful  recovery.  A VMs are  felt  to be dynamic 
lesions  that  evolve  in  response  to  changes  in  blood  flow.  Repeated  use  of PDE  5 
inhibitors  could  induce  changes  in  an  A VM  that  would  make  it  more  likely  to 
hemorrhage,  particularly in the setting of additional stress  from  coitus and elevated 
blood  pressure.  The  potential  for  risk  of  devastating  neurovascular  complications 
related  to PDE 5 inhibitors should  be monitored. Key  Word s: Coital hemorrhage

More  than  100  million  men  worldw ide  suffer  from 
erectile  dysfunction .  In  1998,  sildenafil  citra te  (Viagra), 
the  first oral phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE 5) inhibitor 
for  the  treatment of  this  condition, was approved . Since 
its  introduction,  sildenafil  has  been  prescribed  to  more 
than 15 million  men  worldwide. 1  Its  sales approach $US 
2 billion annually in a market whose value is expected  to 
reach $US 6 billion  by  the end of the d ecad e.2 In 2003,  the 
FDA  approved  2 new  PDE 5 inhibitors:  vardenafil  (Lev 
itra,  Bayer, Pittsburg, PA),  distinguished  from  sildenafil 
by greater biochemical potency, and tadalafil  (Cialis, Lilly 
!COS),  which  is  unique  for  its  prolonged  half-life  and 
extended  window o f efficacy.

PDE 5  is  an isoen zyme of a  family  of cGMP hydrolyz 
ing enzymes. It is loca ted  in vascular  smooth muscle cells 
of  the  penile  corpus  cavernosum,  as  well  as  in  various 
other  human  tissues,  including  the  brain  and  cerebral 
arteries.  In  the  corpus  cavem osum,  inhibitors  of  this 
enzyme permit cGMP to accumulate after  its production 
in response  to  sexual  arousal,  which  in  tum relaxes  the 
smooth  muscle  of  the  penile  vasculature  to  allow  vaso 
dila ta tion  and erection . The  effect of these agents  on  the 
cerebral  vascula ture  is  unclear. Although  PDE  5  inhibi 
tors are not known  to  confer  an increased  risk of central 
nervo us system  hemorrhage, several cases of intraparen 
chym al hemorrha ge associa ted  with  their use have been 
d ocumen ted .  Here  we  d escribe  a  case  of  coital  hemor 
rhage  of  an  arteriovenous  malformati on  (A VM)  after 
premedication  with  tad alafil.

sided  headache  during  intercourse. Two  months  before 
this  incident, his  primary  care physician had  prescribed 
tadalafil  for  erectile  d ysfunction,  and  the  p atient  had 
used  this m edication  several times with fa vorable results 
and n o adverse effects. On this occasion  he h ad  ta.ken  10 
mg  of  tadalafil  2  hours  before  intercourse.  He  exp eri 
enced  no  neurologic  symptoms  until  intercourse,  at 
which  time he had  an abrupt onset of a 9/10 right-sided 
p osterior p arietal  headache. He discontinued  his activity 
and  took  an  asprin  as  well  as  fexofenadine  (Allegra, 
Aventis Pharmaceuticals,  Bridgewater, NJ) for nasal con 
gestion. He  sought medical attention  when  his headache 
did not improve after  approxima tely  1 hour. 

On initial examination  at his local hospital, the p atient 
was  found  to  be  neurologically  intact. H owever,  a  h ead 
computed  tomography  scan  revealed an acute  3.5  cm  X 
4.5  cm  x  6.5  cm  bleed  in  the right temporoparietal area . 
The  patient  was  transferred  to  the  neurologic  inten sive

arrival,  his  only  neurologic  d eficits  were  a  mild  left

well  as  the  previously  noted  superficial draining  vein to 
the  superior  sagittal  sinus.  Formal  visual  field  testing 
confinned a  complete  left  hemianopsia.  The  patient was 
taken  to  surgery,  and the  A VM  was excised . He  had  an

Discussion 

A  number  of adverse neurologic events are associated 
with sexual intercourse. Benign coital headache, vertebral 
and  carotid  artery  dissection,  and  subarachnoid hemor 
rhage during coitus are all well  known to neurosurgeons 
and  neurologists.  H owever,  documentation  of  these 
events h as been  limited . Finelli3  rep orted  a  case of hem 
orrhage  of  a  p robable  cavernous  malformation  during 
sexual  intercourse  in  a  hypertensive  patient.  More  re 
cently,  several  cases  of  intrap arenchymal  hemorrhage 
associated w ith sildenafil  citrate,  both  with and  w ithout 
intercourse,  have  been  described .  Monastero  et  al4  re 
ported  a lobar hemorrhage associa ted  with silden afil  but 
without intercourse. Buxton et al5  d escribed  a lobar hem 
orrhage  after  intercourse and premedication  with silde 
nafil  that  ultimately resulted  in  the p atient's death. Most 
recently, Marti  and Masso6  described  a  midbrain hemor 
rhage  occurring  after  premedication  with  sildenafil  and 
intercourse,  although  the  exact  onset  of  symptoms  in

parietal lobe.  Multiple enlarged vessels are seen in  the sylvian fissure as well 
as  in  the  large  superficinl  draining  vein  (white  a rrow)  to  the superior 
sagittnl sinus.

COITAL  HEMORRHAGE 

relation to these events was not described. To our knowl 
edge,  no  coital  hemorrhage  of  an  A VM  in  association 
with  tadalafil, has yet been reported. 

Our  patient was  a 59-year-old  man  with  a history  of 
moderate hypertension and  an  underlying  A VM  whose 
hemorrhage  occurred  during  intercourse  and  after  pre 
medication  with  tadalafil.  Given  that  the  hemodynamic 
determinants  of  A VM  hemorrhage  have  not  been  de 
fined,  to what extent these factors may have interacted to 
increase  this  patient's  risk  of  hemorrhage  is  open  to 
speculation. 

Coitus is well known to have a marked effect on blood 
pressure in both normal and hypertensive subjects.  Con 
tinuous  intra-arterial  blood  pressure  monitoring  in  am 
bulant hypertensive subjects has shown peaks  values  of 
up to 300/175 mmHg during intercourse, with a mean of 
237 /138  for  men  and 216/127  for  women.7  In  this  con 
text,  it  is  possible  that  extreme  hypertension  alone  trig 
gered this man's hemorrhage, but the potential contribu 
tion  of  tadalafil  to the  presentation, whether  directly or 
even  indirectly  by  permitting  him  to  engage  in  inter 
course,  also should be considered. 

The  adverse  effect  profile  of  all  PDE  5 inhibitors  is 
similar  and  includes  headache,  facial  flushing,  gastro 
esophageal  reflux,  nasal  congestion,  and  visual  distur 
bances. Tadalafil  is  also  associated  with  myalgias  and 
back pain, although  the  mechanism behind  these  symp 
toms is  unclear. The effects of these agents on  the  intra 
cranial  vasculature  are  still  being  elucidated.  Tadalafil 
has greater selectivity than sildenafil for PDE 5 compared 
with  the  other  PDE  isoenzymes.1-6'8  But  Kruuse  et  al9 
have shown that PDE 5 is present in the cerebral arteries 
of  both  rodents  and  humans,  and  that  in  vitro  rodent 
cerebral  arteries  dilate  in  response  to  PDE  inhibitors. 
However,  in a more recent human  study evaluating  the 
effects of sildenafil on cerebral blood flow, Kruuse et al10 
detected no changes in middle cerebral artery diameter as 
measured  with  Doppler  ultrasound  and  no  change  in 
cerebral  blood  flow  as  measured  with  single-photon 
emission computed  tomography. 

The  potential  effects  of  the  PDE  inhibitors  on  A VM 
likewise  have  not been  established;  however,  increased 
blood  flow  is  known  to  produce  progressive  vessel 
changes  in  experimental  models  of  A VMs.  Tears  in  the 
internal  elastic  lamina  of  the  afferent  artery  occur  after 
2-5  days  of high  flow, and  further  changes progress  to 
involve all layers of the vessel to the point where it can no 

181 

longer  be  identified  as  an  artery  or  a vein.11  It  remains 
possible  that  repeated  use  of  PDEs,  particularly  those 
with prolonged half-lives such as  tadalafil,  could induce 
changes  in  an  A VM  that  would  make  it more  likely  to 
hemorrhage when additional stresses from  exertion  and 
elevated  blood  pressure  were  placed  on  it.  This  is  pre 
cisely the scenario that would be repeated time and again 
with  the  chronic  use  of  tadalafil  in  sexual  intercourse. 
Given  the  increasing  popularity of  these agents and  the 
potential for  their  widespread  use  and  abuse  as  perfor 
mance  enhancers even  among  relatively  young individ 
uals who do not suffer from erectile dysfunction,  the risk 
of  devastating  neurovascular  complication  should  be 
monitored.

assessing  whe th er  or  n ot  a  side  e ffect  is  r e lated  to  a  m e dica tion , 
timing  of  onset  of symptom s  in  rela tion  to  ingestion  of  dru g  is 
important  in  a ddition  to  whe the r  symptom s  r ecur  whe n  the  pa

Excess of s erum copper not related to 
ceru.loplasD1in  in Alzheimer disease 

To the  Editor: I  read with interest  the  article  by Squitti et a l. • I 
am  u nce rtain  of t h e  significance  of the  non-ce r ul o pl asrnin  bo und 
copper  in  the  serum  of Alzheime r  patie nts.  Is  it s imply  a  conse 
q u e n ce of Alzheimer  disease (AD ) a ctivity or is  directly impl icate d 
in  the  disease  process? 

AD  a ppea r s  to  h ave  free  copper  unbound  by  ce ru lopla s min  in 
i ncreased  amounts .  This  may  have  cl inical  i·mplica tion s  since 
treatme nt with  clioquinol,  a  m etal-protein-atten uating compound

promotes  Abe ta  di ssol ution,  r esul ted  in  minima l  d e t e rior atio n  of 
cognitive  scor es  in  treated  patie nts compared  to  s ubstan t ia l  d e t e 
rioration  .i n  patie nts  treated  with  placebo. 2 

D e pleted  copper le ve ls  have  been  noted  to r educe  APP  produc 
tion in  ani m a ls  and it  is  tho u ght the  APP r egulation of production 
m ay  r e presen t  a  targe t  for  treatme nt of AD .3  The  a myloidogenic 
pathway  for  Abe ta pe ptides  is  initiate d  by BACEl.  BACEl inte r

Intrace llul ar  copper  h om eostasis  is  very  reg ulated,  since  free 
c u prou s  ions  r eact  with hydroge n  pe roxide  to yield  hydroxyl  radi 
cal.  Copper  is  importe d  by  pl asma  m e mbr ane  transport  protein 
a nd  r a pidly  binds  to  in trace ll ular  copper  chaperone  protein s. 
Amyloid  precursor  protein  may  be  a  copper  chaperone  protein ' 
a n d  de fective -free  cuprous  ions  wou ld  be  a vailable  to  r eact  with 
hydroxyl  r adical,  a  potent  oxidative  agent.  Copper  may  interact 
with  multiple  m echanis m s  implicated  in  AD.

be lie ve  that  e ven  a  s mall  increase  of  t h e  serum  low  molecul ar 
weight component can be  of a  great sig nificance ,  partic ularly  over 
a  long period of time .  When co pper is  bound to low molecular weight 
copper  compounds,  it  can  be  easily  exchanged  among  a lb umin  and

!ability can  potentially r e nde r  copper more  toxic and  promote oxida

components can easily  cross the  blood  brain barrier . 

The  putative  chaperone r ole of the  Amyloid  Precursor P r otein

oped before any attempt for sexual 
intercourse which rules out the 
possibility of sexual exertion being 
the precipitating factor. On  admis 
sion, his blood pressure was 
150/90 mmHg and on neurological 
examination left hemiparesis, 
hemihypoesthesia, and hemihy 
poalgesia were evident. Cranial CT 
and MRI showed hemorrhage in 
the right thalamus, and the poste 
rior limb of the internal capsule 
(Fig. 1 ). Intracranial and extracra 
nial MRA were normal. He had a 
history of mild hypertension but he 
was not on any antihypertensive 
treatment. The patient was admit 
ted to the stroke unit and antihy 
pertensive treatment was initiated. 
Systolic blood pressure was be 
tween 120- 150 mm Hg and diastolic 
between 80- 90 mm Hg during his 
stay. Neurological status improved 
in one week and at discharge, he 
only had mild clumsiness of the left 
hand. 

Sildenafil is a selective phospho 
diestera se-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. As a 
result of PDE-5 inhibition, cyclic 

guanosine monophosphate (c 
GMP)  increases in the vascular 
smooth muscle of corpus caver 
nosum, leading to muscle relax 
ation and vasodilation. Several 
studies have shown that NO- cGMP 
pathway may be responsible for 
cerebral vasodilation by similar 
mechanisms [3] . Recently, Ballard 
et al. have suggested that sildenafil 
acts on PDE-I  and PDE-2 which 
are involved in  the control of cere 
bral vasculature [4] . The increase 
in the blood flow may have raised 
the risk of !CH. 

Furthermore, it is  advised that 

the initial sildenafil dose in the 
elderly should be 25 mg. Our pa 
tient had taken 50 mg of the drug 
as the initial dose which might 
have been another factor increas 
ing the risk of !CH. Sildenafil may 
be the cause of the intracranial 
bleeding in  our patient although a 
chance association cannot be ruled 
out.

lntracerebral hemorrhage 
associated with sildenafil 
use: a case  report

Sirs: lntracerebral hemorrhage 
(!CH) accounts for  approximately 
IO % of all strokes and carries high 
morbidity and mortality. Causes of 
nonhypertensive intracerebral 
hemorrhage are arteriovenous 
malformations, aneurysms, amy 
loid angiopathy, coagulopathies 
and drugs. Drug-induced !CH 
occurs mostly due to anticoagu 
lants, thrombolytics, sympath 
omimetics, metamphetamine and 
cocaine. To our knowledge, there 
are two previous reported cases 
about the relationship between 
sildenafil use and !CH [1,2]. Here 
we report a case of !CH after a 
single dose of sildenafil use. 

A 62-year-old, right-handed 
male was admitted with left-sided 
weakness and numbness. He re 
ported that he had taken 50 mg of 
sildenafil two hours previously and 
had noticed numbness and weak 
ness in his left arm and leg an hour 
after taking the drug. This was the 
first  time he used the drug which 
was prescribed by a urologist He 
indicated that the symptoms devel-

T ada lafil  (Cia li s;  Eli  Lilly,  Indi anapo lis,  IN),  a 
phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE5 )  inhibitor,  is 
used  to  treat  erecti le  dysfunction  in  men.  The 
most  common  adverse  effects  reported  include 
headache,  di zzin ess,  minor  visual  changes,  and 
ischemic optic neuropathy. 1 We describe a patient 
who  developed  inrracerebral  hemorrhage  after 
taking two tablet s of tadalafil  20  mg. 

Case  repo rt.  A  70-yea r-o ld  man  presented  to 
our emergency department with hea dac he,  nau 
sea,  and  vomiting  lasti ng  for  4  days.  H e  was 
a nxio us  a nd  co nfu sed ,  with  memo ry  distur

wise  norma l.  Hi s  medica l  hi story  included 
prostate  ca ncer,  erectil e  dysfunction,  a nd  de 
pr ession.  There was no  hi story of hypertensio n, 
head  trauma,  or  prior  cerebrovascular  disease 
(stroke/T IA),  and no  underlying vasc ul a r o r  he 
mostatic  ri sk  factors.  Blood  pressure and  pu lse 
measured  were  132/65  mm  Hg  and  78  bpm .  A

t race rcbra l hemor rhage (2  X  4  cm  in  di a mete r) 
in  the  right  tempo ra l  lo be  (figure,  A).  During 
admissio n  the  patient  volunteered  that  he  had 
taken  two  tablets  o f  tada lafi l  20  mg  (tota l  40 

mg)  to  enh ance  hi s  sexual  perfor mance  1  ho ur 
before onset  of his acute hea d ache and  th at  his 
sy mpto ms  worsened  moderately during his sex 
ua l intercourse.  A head CT angiography showed 
no vascular anoma lies  or malfo rmatio ns.  The pa 
tient was discharged after 7 days  with  no  further 
headache  and  improve ment  of  his  neurologic 
sympto ms.  A brain  MRI/angiography  performed 
1 mo nth after admission revealed the hypointense

Sildenafil  citrate  (Viagra" ; Pfeizer  US  Pharmaceutical  Group,  New  York,  NY,  USA)  is  a potent vasodilating  agent  to  treat  male  erectile 
dysfunction. Among  its adverse  effects, hemorrhagic stroke  has  not been  widely reported  yet.  We  present a case  of a 33-year-old  healthy man 
who  ingested  50  mg  sildenafil  a half hour  before  onset  of  headache,  nervousness  and  speech  di sturbance. Head  computed  tomogram  of this 
stuporous  man  showed  huge  intracerebral  hemorrhage  and  thick  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,  but  angiography  failed  to  disclose  any  vascular 
anomalies. Subsequent  surgical  procedure  was  followed, and  rehabilitation  was  provided  thereafter.  Sildenafil seems  to  act  by  redistributing 
arterial  blood  flow,  and  concurrent sympathetic  hyperactivity,  which  lead  to such  hemorrhagic presentation. Extreme  caution  should  be paid  on 
even  in a young adult male patient wven without known risk factors.

INTRODUCTION 

CASE REPORT 

For a decade,  sildenafi.l  citrate  (Viagra"; Pfeizer US  Phar 
maceutical  Group,  New York,  NY,  USA)  has  become one 
of the top-selling product in the world-wide market for  ma.le 
impotence  treatment.  Since  its  first  introduction  however, 
numerous adverse effects have been reported, and parricular 
anention should  be paid  upon  when  prescription  is  consi 
dered.  With  regard  to  intracerebra.l  hemorrhage  (ICH), 
there  are  only four  English written  literatures 1•4•9•10l.  All  of 
these  cases  showed  minimal-to-moderate  degree  hemor 
rhage with unremarkable recovery. 

We experienced  a  case  of massive  ICH  associated  with 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)  requiring surgical  removal. 
This young  ma.le  parient did  not have  any  risk  factors  for 
hemorrhage. A detailed case  report and possible pachophy 
siologic explanarions are presented.

A  33-year-old  man  was  brought  in  to  the  Emergency 
Room  for  sudden  unconsciousness  following  paroxysmal 
headache, nervousness and speech disturbance of two-hour 
durarion. Approximately a ha.If hour prior to symptom onset, 
he ingested one tablet of 50  mg si.ldenafiJ  citrate to anempt 
sexual intercourse, but he could not. 

Although he was slightly overweight (178 cm, 88 kg), he 
had been healthy and free  of any significant medical history, 
including arterial hypertension,  diabetes,  hyperlipidemia, 
migraine,  pre-existing  cardiovascular  or cerebrovascular 
diseases.  He  took  no  ocher  medications,  except  episodic 
common-cold remedies.  He had a  15-year history of tobacco 
smoking  (approximately  1  pack per day),  and  ingested 
irregular  alcohol  about  two  times  per  week,  presumably 
more  than  social  drinking.  He had  been  married  35  days 
before this  event, and  had  taken sildenaftl citrate 25  mg for 
two  times  during  recent  2 weeks  chat were prescribed  by a 
urologist.  His wife denied any similar symptoms when used 
previously. 

On admission, he was profoundly stuporous, densely quap 
riparetic  (Grade  3/Grade  1),  and  had  fully  dilated  pupils. 
Vital  signs showed  high  blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg,

rapid  pulse  rate  (108/min)  and  respiration  (24/min),  and 
fever  up  to  38.YC  ,  respectively.  Brain  computed  tomo 
graphy (CD showed a huge ICH on  the right basal  ganglia, 
intraventricular clots  and  thick SAH (Fig.  1).  A  CT angio 
graphy and  trasnfemoral  catheter  angiography  (TFCA) 
failed  to  disclose  any vascular  lesion  on  the corresponding 
hemisphere (Fig. 2). 

Because  of impending  herniation,  we  hurried  him  into 
the  operating  room  for  decompression.  Following dural 
reflection,  swollen  brain  was  encountered,  and  prompt 
temporal  corticectomy was  conducted  to  find  organizing 
hematoma.  After  gentle  suction  and  irrigation  of hema 
toma,  the  sylvian  fissure  was  widely  split  to  show  most 
course of the  right  middle  cerebral  artery  (MCA).  From 
distal  portion,  the MCA was  thoroughly  inspected  up  to 
the proximal MCA, but we could not find  any aneurysmal 
dilatation or other angiomatous lesions. Meticulous  hemo 
stasis and expansive duroplasty was done. Skull flap was  not 
covered to control raised intracranial pressure. 

Postoperatively, he remained  stuporous,  but motor func 
tion was slightly improved (Grade 5/Grade 1).  While in the 
intensive care unit stay, blood laboratory tests and serologic 
tests  were  undertaken,  but  there  were  no  proven  clues  for 
the  incracranial  bleeding.  Afterwards,  robust  rehabilitation 
was  followed,  and cerebrospinal  fluid  diversion  and cranio 
plascy  was  performed  for  delayed  hydrocephalus  and  skull 
defect,  at postoperative 40 days  (Fig.  3). At the last follow 
up visit,  18 months postoperatively,  he regained  conscious 
ness,  was able to communicate with care givers in restricted 
extent,  but was  still  hemiparetic  (Grade  5/Grade  3)  on 
wheel-chair  and  dependent  for  commanding  major  acti 
vities of daily living. 

DISCUSSION 

Causes  of ICH in a  non-hypertensive  subject are largely 
divided  into  structural  vascular  anomalies  (arceriovenous 
malformation, aneurysm,  moyamoya disease, amyloid angio 
pathy), and dysfunctional coagulation (coagulopathy, drugs). 
Drug-induced  ICH  is  mostly attributed  to  anticoagulants, 
thrombolytics,  sympathomimetics,  mecamphecamine,  or 
cocaine!). Although  there  are  four  previous  reports  about 
ICH after  sildenafil  use,  all  of these  were  manifested  as 
minimal volume hemorrhage in  elderly with risk  factors and 
thus, surgical  evacuation was  not required 1•4•9•10l . The present 
case  mimics  either  diffuse,  thick SAH from  rupture of the 
proximal MCA aneurysm, or massive ICH leaking into the 
ventricles  and  subarachnoid space.  With  the  aid  of angio 
graphy,  possibility of vascular  anomaly was  discarded.  The 
cause  and  effect  relationship  of sildenafil  and  ICH  herein,

can be established when considering close temporal relation

Sildenafil  (UK-92,480), an orally active,  selective inhibitor 
of phosphodiesterase type  5  (PDE-5), is  a crucial  regulator 
of cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP)  and  ac  first

intention, it is  manufactured aiming at the corpus caverno 
sum of the human  male.  It  plays  a  role  in  causing muscle 
relaxation,  vasodilatation  and penile erection  by increasing 
concentration  of cGMP and  nitrous  oxide  (NO)  in the 
smooth muscle  of the corpus  cavemosum3l. Side effects  of 
sildenafil,  including flushing,  headache,  nasal  congestion, 
and changes in pulmonary blood flow can tell  us  that such 
vasodilatory  effect  is  not confined  to  the corpus  cavemo 
sum 11·12l. This  drug also  redistributes  the arterial  flow,  and 
decreases  perfusion,  consequently may lead  to  acute  myo 
cardial  infarction.  For  the above  reasons,  it  lowers  systolic 
blood pressure by 8 to 10 mmHg in clinical trials14l. 

Several  ischemic  manifestations,  such  as  transient  ische 
mic attack, ischemic stroke, cerebral infarction,  or ischemic 
optic  neuropathy  can  be  explained  by the above  mecha 
nisms8l. Vasodilatory effect of sildenafil may also cause atrial 
fibrillation,  provoke atrial  thrombi and cardioembolism  in 
a  pre-existing  cardiomyopathic patient  by  increasing pres 
sure gradient  over  the  left ventricular  outflow  tracr2l.  On 
the other hand,  hypotension could lead to  secondary sym 
pathetic  hyperactivity'3·12l.  Hypotension,  cardiac arrhythmia, 
and rebound sympathetic hyperactivity seems  to  play con 
certed roles in producing stroke, especially in ischemic stroke. 
In previous literatures, we could not find any linear  relation 
ship  between  drug dosage  (25  mg,  50  mg,  100  mg)  and 
occurrence  of stroke1.4,5,7•10l.  But,  all  cases  were  associated 
with  utilizing  more  than  50  mg once  or  twice  in  a  short 
period. An unknown process  of sensitization may be involv 
ed however,  the mode of drug action  in large part, may be 
not cumulative but idiosyncratic. 

The  reported  occurrence  of headache,  dizziness,  visual 
disturbances,  retinal dysfunction, and a pupil-sparing oculo 
motor palsy suggest  that sildenafil  affects  regulation  of the 
cerebral  microvasculature.  In addition  to  a  selective  action 
on PDE-5,  sildenafil  may act on other  two  types  of PDE 
(PDE-1  and PDE-2), which are involved in control of cereb 
ral vasculature6•13>. To date,  there has  been no clear evidence 
to  explain  pertinent  mechanisms  of ICH associated  with 
sildenafil. 

In summary,  sildenafil  may act by redistributing arterial 
blood flow,  hence  rendering  brain  tissue  more  inappro 
priate perfusion,  presenting as  prodromes  of headache,  ner 
vousness  and speech  disturbance  as  shown  in  the  current 
case.  Ensuing sympathetic hyperactivity  through  PDE-1 
and PDE-2 might lead to  rupture of vessels.  Although it is 
contrary  to  common  belief,  we suggest  that  these  inciting 
and  propagating factors  for  ICH  even  in  a  young adult 

male patient without known  risk factors  should be warned 
before prescribing sildenafil. 

CONCLUSION 

Sildenafil  is  a  potentially  dangerous  drug,  which  can 
provoke  life-threatening ICH and  SAH  in  a  young adult 
male.  When considering usage,  careful  discussion and pre 
medication  work-up  with  urologist  is  mandatory.  Adverse 
effect,  such  as  headache,  nervousness,  dizziness  or speech 
disturbance should  be  promptly diagnosed  to  minimize 
sequelae.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage associated 
with tadalafil 
Tadalafil  is  a  phosp hodiesterase  type 
s (PDES)  inhibitor  indicated  fo r  th e 
trea tm ent  of  erectile  dysfun ction.  in  
hibiti on  of th e  PDES  isoenzyme,  which 
is  responsible  for  degradation  of cyclic 
guan osine mo noph osp hate  in  the corpus 
cavernosum, will  ultimately enhance  the 
effect  of nitric  oxi de  and,  consequently, 
the  relaxation  of  the  vascular  sm oo th 
muscle  in  the  corp us  cave rnosum  and 
penile  erection  afte r  sexual  stimulati on. 
Tadalafil  is  the  longest-acting  PDES  in  
hibitor,  with  an  elimination  half-life  of 
17.5  ho urs and  up to 36  ho urs' duration 
of effect.  The  drug  has  been  associated 
with headache,  flu shin g, dizziness, visual 
disturbances, and hypotension.1 

in g  o ne  20- mg  tabl et  of tadalafil  a  few 
ho urs  before  the  onset  of  symptoms 
and  stated  th at  he  had  started  taking 
tadalafil  recently  "as  needed "  without 
consultin g  a  health  care  provider.  A 
computed  tom ogra phy (CT) scan of his 
head  revealed  a  subarac hno id  hemor 
rhage  (SAH)  (3  x  4 cm  in diameter) ; CT 
angiography of the head showed novas 
cular ab no rm aliti es  o r aneurysm al mal 
fo rm atio ns.  An  electro cardi ogra m  and 
a  chest  radiograp h  were  normal,  and 
all  labora tory  test values and vital signs 
were  within  normal  limits.  The  patient 
had  an  un eventful  fo ur-day  stay  in  the 
intensive care unit; he received 60  mg of 
nimodipin e  orally  very  fo ur  hours  and 
was discharged  hom e. 

A 45-yea r-old  previously healthy man 
arrived at the emergency department with 
a severe headache of five  ho urs' duration 
associated  with  one  ep isode  of  vom it 
in g.  T here  was  no  decrease  in  the  level 
of  conscio usness,  no  foca l  n eurologic 
d efici t,  and  no  convulsive  activi ty.  Th e 
patient was  previously  healthy,  with  no 
history  of diabe tes  meUitus,  hyper ten 
sion,  cerebrovascular  disease,  trauma, 
o r bleeding disorders and deni ed  taking 
any  prescription  medication,  over- the 
co un te r  medicin e,  or  herbal  produ cts. 
The pati ent's  family  and  social  histo ri es 
were unremarkable.  On  examin ation , h e 
was  agi tate d  and  in  severe  discomfort 
due  to  the  headache.  H e  reported  tak-

This  patient's  adverse  reaction  can 
be  attributed  to  tadalafil  because  of the 
temporal relationship between use of the 
drug and the SAH. The probable associa 
tion  of the event with  tadalafi l use is en 
hanced by the fact that the patient had no 
risk  factors  for  develo ping  an  SAH,  and 
no  underlying etiology was  evident.  Use 
of  the  Naranjo  et  aJ.2  adverse- reaction 
probability scale  revealed  a  probable as 
sociation  between  the  SAH  and  tadalafil 
(score of 6). In addition, a PubMed search 
about thi s  probable  association  revealed 
two  cases  of  intracerebral  hem orrhage 
(!CH ) associated with the use of tadalafil. 
Steeves et al. 3  reported a possible associa-

tion  between  tadalafil  use  and arteriove 
no us  malformation  (AVM)  hemorrhage 
during  coitus  in  a  59-year-old  man. 
The  AVM  was  excised,  and  the  pati ent 
made an  uneventful  recovery.  Gazzeri et 
al.4  described  an  !CH  in  a  70-year-old 
man  without  evidence  of  any  vascular 
anomalies  who  took  40  mg  of tadalafil 
to  enhan ce  his  sexual  performance  one 
ho ur  before  the onse t of symptoms. The 
patient was  discharged  from  th e hospi tal 
after  seve n  days  with  improvement  in 
neurologic  symptoms.  Six  cases  of SAH 
or  !CH  have  been  repo rted  after  the  in 
gestion  of si ldenafil,'· 10  and  a single case 
of !CH was  reported  in  a  patient  taking 
vardenafi l. 11 

Tadalafil  ca n  inhibit  PD ES,  which 
is  found  in  platelets.  This  can  lead  to 
the  inhibition  of platelet  activation  and 
aggregation."  On  the  other  hand,  ni 
tri c  oxide  induces  relaxation  of  vascu 
lar  smooth  muscles.  Platelet  inhibition 
com bined  with  increased  cerebral blood 
flow  may be associated with an  in creased 
risk of SAH.9  Although  tadalafil  has  not 
been shown  to  in crease bleeding times in 
healthy  patients,  the  man u facturer  rec 
o mm ends  that  caution  be  exercised  in 
patients  with  bleeding  disorders  or sig 
nificant active peptic ulcera tio n. 1 

Given the potential risk of hemorrhag 
ic stroke after the ingestion of tadalafil, cli 
nicians sho uld be cautio us when  prescrib 
ing  this  medi cation  and  should  consider 
this agent as  a  potential cause  of cerebral 
hemorrhage in patients with no other un  
derlying etiology or risk factors.

A Web-based experiential rotation platform 
Today's  college  students  may  require 

different  approaches  to  teaching  and 
learning. T he so-called "v ideo-game gen 
eration" currently  populating the  major 
ity of pharmacy schools  is  adept at using 
technology and seems  to  respond well  to 
interactive  teaching  techniques. '  Efforts 
to  in crease  the  use  of technology  to  en 
gage  students  in  learning  have  been  met 
with  some  success.'""  To  date,  little  has 
been  reported outside the classroom  set 
ting  regarding  the  use  of  technology  to 
individualize  a  student's  experience  or 
the  integration  of  technology  into  the 
clinical  experiences  of  a  pharmacy  resi 
dency program. 5 

Currently,  severa l  colleges  of  phar 
macy use Web platforms to serve as a hub 
for  students  and  preceptors  at  rotation 
sites.6  Our institution effectively uses this 
type  of system  to  distribute  important 
announcements,  view  student  and  pre 
ceptor  schedules,  and  complete  evalua 
tions.  Recently,  we  began  exploring  the 
use of a  Web-based  platform  (M icrosoft 
SharePoint,  Microsoft  Corp.,  Redmond, 
WA)  to  organize and shepherd  students 
through  common  advanced  pharmacy 
practice  expe ri ences  (AP PEs )  at our  in 
st ituti on, as  well  as  coordinate  the  rota 
tion  experiences  of pharmacy  residents. 
For  preceptors,  this  technology  affords 
numerous  advantages,  which  are  de 
scribed below. 

Microsoft SharePoint is  an  integrated 
server program within  the Microsoft Of 
fice  system.'  This  platform  enables  pre 
ceptors  to  customize  a  website  specific 
to  their  rotation.  Students  are  provided 
with  immediate  and  ongoing  access  to 
the overall  rotation  description , expecta 
tions, and assignments. 

One of the benefits  of using this type 
of technology  fo r  experiential  education 
is  its  customizabi lity.  Preceptors  are  free 
to  upload  documents,  design  student 
controlled  pages  (e.g.,  biogs),  and  de 
velop  calendars.  Users  are  granted  per 
mission  to  view,  modify,  and  control 
con tent  by  the  preceptor.  We  have  cho 
sen  an  approach  that  wiU  allow  each 
rotation  site  to  have  a  simi lar  structure 

while maintaining preceptors' autonomy 
regarding  co ntent.  This  should  provide 
some  fam ili arity  for  students  who  have 
several APPEs.  In  addition, a  core group 
of  preceptors  can  facilitate  a  site  tem 
plate and design for those preceptors less 
comfortable  with  the  process.  Residents 
a lso  frequently  engage  in  these  rotation 
experiences  and  can  have  materials  and 
resources specific to  their  level of exper 
tise  and  rotatio n  objectives  layered  into 
each rotation site. 

At  its  most  basi c  level ,  the  rotation 
website  can  be  used  to  house  the  basic 
information  a  student  or  resident  may 
need  for  the  rotatio n  experience.  Links 
to  the current syllabus, contact informa 
tion,  and  a  rotation  calenda r  are  com 
mon  componen ts  of o ur  rotation  web 
sites. Learning modules can  add another 
layer  of content  to  the  website. Another 
approach to developing con tent for  these 
Web  pages  may be  to  have  each  student 
or resident create a  concise summ ary on 
a  topic.  This succinct,  one- or  two-page 
primer on a specific  topic could  serve as 
the  initial  content  for  each  module.  In 
combination  with  a  library of represen 
tative readings and online resources, each 
module  page  can  be  a  comp lete  mixed 
media  resource  that  students  and  resi 
dents can  access  at  a ny point during the 
rotation experience. 

SharePoint  also  enables  the  construc 
tion  of "wiki" and blog pages.  This  func 
tion  would  permit  students  to  keep  a 
journal of their experiences for the month 
(e.g.,  unique  patient  cases  encountered, 
drug information  pearls learned, key con 
cepts or queries that required time and ef 
fort to research).  In  addition, because the 
entire website is searchable, each  topic re 
corded o n the journal page is then part of 
the content o n  the si te and viewable from 
the primary content pages. 

As  with  any  new educational  tool,  the 
effectiveness  of  this  Web-based  module 
wiU  need  to  be  assessed.  We  believe  that 
two  global  areas  should  be  addressed 
in  the  assessment  of this  type  of educa-

ABSTRACT 

Sildenafil is a drug used in the treatment of male impotence. Few cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage following the use of sildenafil 
have been  cited  in  the literature.  A 42-year-old man was admitted to the em ergency outpatient clinic of Istanbul Edu ca tional and Research 
Hospital after sudden loss  of con sciousness.  He had ingested alcohol, taken 50mg sildenafil and had sex ual intercourse.  Non-contrast cranial 
tomograph y revea led an intracerebral  hematoma with extension to the ventricles. 

Sildenafi l Is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor. With the inhibition of PDE-5, the amount of cyclic- guanosine monophosphate 
(c-GMP) in the smooth vascular mu scle cells in the corpus cavernosum increases, leading to a relaxation of mu scles and va sodilatation. Studies 
have shown that the NO-c-GMP pathway leads to cerebra l vasodilatatlon with a similar mechanism. The literature has shown that the effect of 
PDE- 1 and PDE-2 on cerebral bleeding control is affected by sildenafi l. Thi s increased blood flow increases the ri sk of intracranial haemorrhage. 

Although data concerning th e presentation of intracerebral hematoma in conne ction with th e combined use  of alcohol ingestion and u se of 
sildenafil is inadequate, it can  neverth eless be thought that the combi ned use increases the ri sk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and 
caution is in  order concerning the matter.

INTRODUCTION 

Sildenafil is  a drug used in the treatment of male impotence. 
It has a direct effect on the vessels of the corpus cavernosum . 
Sildenafil  acts  on  the corpus cavernosum  by way of a raised 
concentration  of c-GMP and  NO  in  the smooth  muscle cells. 
The  increased  c-GMP  concentration  leads  to  vasodi latation 
and the erection  of the penis (7) . In  addition to this vascular 
reaction, other well-known side effects are flushing, headache 
and  dizziness  due  to  dilatation  of  the  cerebral  veins  (10). 
Among its adverse effects,  hemorrhagic stroke has  not been 
widely reported  yet (7) . Although  few  cases  of spontaneous 
intracranial  hemorrhage following  the  use  of sildenafil  have

CASE REPORT 

A 42-year-o ld man was admitted to the emergency outpatient 
clinic  of  istanbul  Educational  and  Research  Hospital  after 
sudden  loss  of consciousness.  He wa s said  to have  ingested 
alcohol,  taken  SO  mg  sildenafil  and  had  sexual  intercourse. 
On admission, blood pressure was 210/ 130 mm Hg and pulse 
88  per minute. The  Glasgow Coma  Scale  score was  5 (no eye 
opening, no verbal response and flexion to pain ). Non-contrast 
cranial  tomography  revealed  an  anterior  interhemispheric 
bleeding with extension to all  four ventricles (Figure 1, 2).  An

DISCUSSION 

The  reasons  of non-traumatic intracerebral  hemorrhage can 
be  categorised  as  hypertension,  non-hypertens ive  gross 
structural  vascular  ano malies  (AVM,  aneurysm,  MoyaMoya 
disease,  amyloid  angiopathy,  etc.),  intracranial  neoplasms, 
cerebral  venous  thrombosis,  infection  and  dysfunctional 
coagulopathy. Drug-induced intracerebral haemorrhages are 
related  to  anticoagulant  thrombolytics,  sympathomimetics, 
methamphetamines  or cocaine  (1,  7).  Cases  of intracerebral 
hemorrhages in relation to sildenafil use are being increasingly 
reported recently (1, 3 ,4,7, 11 ). 

Sildenafil  is a selective phosphodiesterase-S (PDE-5)  enzyme 
inhibitor. With  the inhibition of PDE-S,  the amount of cyclic 
guanosine monophosphatase (cGMP) in the vascular smooth 
muscle  cells  in  the  corpus  cavernosu m  increases,  lead ing 
to  a  relaxation  of  muscles  and  vasodilatation  (1 ).  Studies 
have  shown  that the  NO-c-GMP  pathway  leads  to  cerebral 
vasodilatation  with a similar  mechanism  (1 , 4).  Alpsan  et  al. 
has  shown  that the  effect  of PDE-1 and  PDE-2  on  cerebral 
bleeding  is  affected  by sildenafil. This  increase  in  blood flow 
may increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (1 ). 

The  side  effects  of sildenafil are  well  known. There  are  side 
effects  related  to  vascular  structures  such  as  headache, 
flushing, diuiness and  nasal congestion (10). 

Another  result  of the  non-prescription  use  of  the  drug  is 
usage  in  improper dose. The  recommended  starting dose of 
sildenafil should be 50 mg and the maximum dose within 24 
hours shou ld be  100 mg (10, 11). 

Sildenafil is the best selling drug in  the global market for the 
treatment of male  impotence  (7). In  addition  to  the  use  of 
prescription  sildenafil,  the  non-prescription  use of the  drug 
is  sign ificantly  high  due  to  the  ease  in  access  to  the drug 
without a prescription. 

In  this  study;  an  intracerebral  hemorrhage  case  due  to 
the  ingestion  of  alcohol  with  sildenafil  where  surgical 
treatment  was  not  possible  is  presented.  Although  there 
are  cases  of  subarachnoid  haemorrhage  and  intracerebral 
hemorrhage  caused  by  the  use  of sildenafil,  there  are  few 
cases in the literature reporting intracerebral or subarachnoid 
hemorrhage associated  with the use of sildenafil (1 , 7,  8,  11 , 
10). 

Sildenafil  is  not reported  to interact with ASA, antiacids and 
alcohol (6).  It is  difficult to  understand  the effects of alco hol 
ingestion in  cases  of intracranial  hemorrhage caused  by the 
combined ingestion of sildenafil with alcohol. There are reports 
in  literature  that  point  to  a  possible  relationship  between 
the  ingestion  of  alcohol  and  spontaneous  intracerebral

hemorrhage (2,  6, 9). There is  no data suggesting an  increase 
in  the  risk  of spontaneous  intracerebral  hemorrhage due to 
combined  ingestion  of alcohol  and  sildenatil.  However,  our 
spontaneous  intracerebral  hemorrhage case  after ingestion 
of alcohol and sildenatil indicates that this could be a harmful 
combination. 

CONCLUSION 

Although  there  is  inadequate  data  to  connect  intracerebral 
hemorrhage to the  combined  use  of alcohol  ingestion  and 
non-prescription use of sildenatil, caution should be exercised 
about  drinking  alcoholic  beverages  when  using  sildenatil 
as  this  may  increase  the  risk  of spontaneous  intracerebral 
hemorrhage.

lntracranial aneurysm and sildenafil 

Avinash Adiga, MD', Hawa Edriss, MD, and Kenneth  Nugent, MD 

Sildenafil  is one of the  most GOmmonly used drugs for the treatment of 
erectile dysfunction. To date, we found five reported cases of intracerebral 
bleeding and two reported cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage related to 
sildenafil use. We report a 49-year-old hypertensive and diabetic patient 
who presented with acute pulmonary edema and loss of consciousness 
following  ingestion  of 100  mg  of sildenafil  prior to  sexual  intercourse. 
He was  not previously aware  of the  presence  of an  aneurysm and  had 
no  family  history  of  it.  Computed  tomography  of  his  head  revealed  a 
subarachnoid  hemorrhage due to rupture  of a saccular aneurysm  with 
subsequent repeat  hemorrhage  within  a few  hours  of presentation. A 
sudden increase in blood pressure led to pulmonary edema. Studies have 
shown that sildenafil acts on  phosphodiesterase-1, -2 and -5 receptors 
and leads to a secondary increase in intracerebral circulation and vaso 
dilatory effects, leading to sympathetic overactivity which increases the 
risk for intracranial bleeding . 

S ildenafil, marketed as Viagra, is a widely used phospho 

diesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitor to treat male sexual/erectile 
dysfunction and to increase libido  and sexual  perfor 
mance. The common adverse effects ofthis drug include 
headache, flushing, indigestion, and impaired vision. Five cases 
ofintracerebral bleeding and two cases of subarachnoid hemor 
rhage (SAH) due to sildenafil use have been reported (1-7). We 
report a 49-year-old  man who  presented with a hypertensive 
crisis and an SAR caused by rup.ture of a saccular intracranial 
aneurysm during sexual intercourse following sildenafil intake. 

CASE REPORT 

A 49-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and hypertension 
was brought in to the emergency department due to acute-onset 
shortness of breath and loss of consciousness during sexual inter 
course. The patient had ingested 1 oa mg of sildenafil prior to the 
event (unknown time gap). Reportedly, he was diaphoretic and 
short of breath and required intubation due to a low Glasgow 
Coma$cale score of <7.  His blood pressure was  181/105 mm 
Hg with  a mean arterial  pressure  of 124 mm Hg.  His chest 
examination revealed bibasilar crackles. A neurological examina 
tion was not completed because the patient was sedated. His pu 
pils were.round and reactive with normal deep tendon reflexes, 
and he coulcj.  localize the pain.  Routine blood counts, platelet 

counts, ,and coagulation factors  were  normal.  His chest x-ray 
revealed  diffuse  bilateral  opacities  consistent with pulmonary 
edema. An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm. 
An  arterial  blood gas  showed high anion  gap  (29)  metabolic 
,acidosis with respiratory acidosis:  pH 7 .22; partial pressure of 
oxygen, 68  mm Hg;  par_tial  pressure of carbon dioxidi:, 42.7 
mm Hg;  bicarbonate,  17.1  mEq/L; and lactate,  4.7 mmol/L. 
Bedside t:ransthoracic echocardiography showed normal systolic 
function with no regional wall  motion abnormality and grade 
II diastolic dysfunction. 

Computed tomography of the head showed a massive acute 
SAH with the largest blood collection in the area of the anterior 
communicating artery with mild hydrocephalus  (Figure  la). 
The  patient was  started on :mannitol  100  g over 30 minutes 
and underwent computed tomography angiogram of intracra 
nial vessels, which showed an aneurysm at the junction of the 
right anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating ar 
tery (Figure lb).  He was  urgently taken to the operating room 
and underWent ventriculostomy. While in the operating room, 
his ventricular pressures increased, his  pupils dilated, ~uggest 
ing  brain  herniation,  and he underwent bilateral decompres 
sive  craniotomy and aneurysm clipping.  Postoperatively, his 
Glasgow  Coma Scale  score was  3/f5,  and he was· coolecj.  to 
maintain temperature around 35°C for  48 hours.  Because of 
his low Glasgow Coma Scale score, his chances for safe  extu 
bation seemed unlikely, and a tracheostomy and percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy tube were placed on postoperative day 
8.  On postoperative day 10, he started to improve slowly,  and 
his Glasgow Coma Scale  increased to  15/15 on postoperative 
day 31. He continued to require a tracheostomy collar and was 
discharged to a neurorehabilitation instituti:. 

DISCUSSION 

Sildenafil  inhibits  PDE-5-mediated hydrolysis  of cyclic 
guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP),  leading  to  increased 
intracellular  cGMP levels  in  the  vascular smooth muscle  of 
the corpus cavernosum and resulting in smooth muscle relax 
ation  and arterial vasodilation  (8).  The amount of cGMP in

cerebrovascular smooth muscles  is  affected  by nitric oxide and 
PDE.  Nitric oxide  activates  guanylate  cyclase  in  the  cerebral 
arterial cells. The activated guanylate cyclase converts guanosine 
triphosphate to  cGMP. The latter causes  relaxation  of vascular 
smooth muscle cells  in the cerebral vasculacure  (9,  10). 

The  relationship  between  intracranial  hemorrhage  (ICH) 
and sildenafil  use  is  likely due  to  increased  blood flow  to  the 
intracranial vessels, which is significantly increased during sexual 
intercourse.  Increased  blood flow  to  the cerebral  blood vessels 
facilitates rupture of the cerebrovascular vessels in patients with 
other hemorrhagic risk factors  (3).  Ballard et al  suggested  that 
sildenafil  also  acts  on PDE-1  and PDE-2, which are  involved 
in  controlling cerebral  circulation  (11).  Studies  on  mice have 
demonstrated  that sildenafil  decreases  cerebral  vasospasm  by 
increasing and  restoring  cGMP levels  (12).  The  reported  ad 
verse effects of sildenafil include headache, visual disturbances, 
pupil-sparing third nerve palsy, and transient hypertension, and 
these symptoms suggest that sildenafil also affects brain micro 
vasculature  regulation  (13,  14).  Unusual susceptibility to  this 
drug could lead to abnormal vasodilatation of cerebral arteries 
and abnormal redistribution of arterial blood flow in the brain. 
The hypothetical  relationship  between  ICH and sildenafil 
ingestion  is  not well  understood  (2,  5).  Transcranial  Doppler 

studies have shown that sildenafil  increases cerebrovascular re 
activity and causes vasodilation with increased blood flow and 
volume (15).  The vasodilatory effect of sildenafil  causes  hypo 
tension  that could lead  to  an  increase  in sympathetic activity, 
which might be  the reason for secondary hypertension leading 
to SAH, as occurred in our case. Ayberk et al  reported a case of 
intracerebral  bleed in a healthy 35-year-old man 3  hours after 
ingestion of 50 mg of sildenafil without any sexual activity (5) . 
This supports our conclusion  that sildenafil  results  in  reactive 
sympathetic hyperactivity that leads  to  ICH  regardless  of the 
presence or absence of other risk factors,  such as  hypertension 
and sexual  intercourse.  Nevertheless,  our known hypertensive 
patient had an elevated blood pressure and SAH after sildenafil 
use.  Whether the hypertensive crisis  in  this  patient caused  by 
sildenafil was secondary to sympathetic hyperactivity or sexual 
intercourse or whether the ICH itself caused hypertension can 
not  be  determined.  Also,  we  do  not know if there  is  a dose 
related effect which causes ICH. All reported patients ingested 
50 mg or more (Table  1). 

Sildenafil citrate has been shown to be safe in patients without 
cardiovascular disease but is  contraindicated in  those with acute 
coronary syndromes, life-threatening coronary arrhythmias, and 
recent stroke. The US  Food and Drug Administration advises

cardial  infarction  or stroke within  6  months and those  with 
resting hypotension, severe  hypertension (<1 7 0/110 mm Hg), 
and heart failure  (16). 

All five  previously reported  intracerebral  hemorrhages with 
sildenafil  use  presented with  minimal volume  hemorrhage  in 
elderly patients with a risk factor ofICH, and surgical evacuation 
was not required (Table  I) (l-5). However,  the previous two re 
ports ofSAH with sildenafil use were associated with severe bleed 
ing  (6, 7). One patient required emergency decompression due 
to impending herniation, and the other patient was pronounced 
dead on  arrival  (6, 7).  Our patient rebled  following  the initial 
SAH and underwent ventriculostomy and bilateral decompres 
sive cranioromy. His neurological status improved tremendously, 
and his  Glasgow Coma Scale score was  15/15 on discharge.  In 
conclusion, sildenafil is  a relatively safe and widely used medica 
tion to treat erectile dysfunction. However, serious complications, 
such as severe ICH and SAH, have been reported with its  use.

Case Report 

A  28-year-old  man  with  no  medical  histo ry,  was  ad 
mitted  afte r  a  3-day  hi sto ry  of  sudd en-onset,  rig ht 
sided  headache  with  vomiting  occurring  2  ho urs  after 
taking  10 mg  o f  vardenafil.  H e  also  noticed  lower  back 
pain after the head ache onset.  He  had no  history of trauma 
and  his  only  cardiovascular  risk  was  a  7-year  smoking 
history.  He  reported having  ingested  vardenafil  solely  out 
of  curiosity  and  denied  sex ual  intercourse.  His  neuro 
logica l  exa mination  res ult  was  nonfoca l.  Labo ratory 
findings,  including  platelet count and coagulation  panels, 
were normal.  Computed  tomography  and  magnetic  res 
onance imaging (MRI)  of the brain revealed a  small, right 
sided, subdural hematoma (Fig 1, A,B). Magnetic resonance 
angiography and venography  showed no vascular lesions. 
Lumbar MR!  revealed a  longitudinally  extended subdu 
ral  hematoma  (Fig  1,  C,D).  Hi s  symptom s  gradually

toms  had  completely  disappeared  10  days  after  onset. 
Repeat  computed  tomography  and  MRI  scans  showed

Discussion 

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  case  of  s ubd ural 
hemorrhage  associated  with  PDE-5  inhibitors.  Concom 
itant  intracranfa l  and  spina l  ASDH  are  also  rare 
phenomena .•  A  previous  study  reported  a  3%  incidence 
rate  for  intracrania l,  nontraumatic  ASDH,6  with  risk 
factors  including  hypertension,  vascular  abnormalities 
such as aneurysm, and anticoagulation therapy.'  In con  
trast,  similar  to  other  reported  cases,  our  patient  had 
almost no  risk  factors.24  Although  the  underlying  mech 
anism  remains unknown, the  vasodilatory and antiplatelet 
effects  of PDE-5  inhibitors8·9  may  be  associated  with  the 
ASDH  in  our  patient.  Further evidence of  the  relation 
ship  between  va.rdena.fil  and  bleeding  in  our  patient  is 
based  on  the  time  from  drug  ingestion  to  headache 
onset,  which  corresponds  to  the  time  to  maximum 
concentration  of  vardenafil. 10  PDE-5  inhibitors  may  be 
associated  with  intracranial  and  spinal hematoma  risks. 
When  headache,  vomiting, and  lower  back  pa.in  appear 
after  the  administration  of  PDE-5  inhibitors,  the  possi 
bility  of hemorrhagic  diseases  must  be  considered .

lntracerebral  hemorrhage 
occurs when a diseased  blood 
vessel within  the brain  bursts. 
We  present a  case of 69-year-
old  patient with  two sequ ential 
e pisodes of lobar intracerebral 
hemorrhage occurring during 
sex ual  intercourse.  Both 
e pisodes were associated  with 
the  use of phosphodiestera se-5 
inhibitors. Thi s is  the first case 
reported which  is  temporally 
associated with  iso lated  bilate ral 
lobar bleeds with appropriate 
use of phos phodiestera se-5 
inhibitor on  two  different 
occasions associated  with sexual 
intercourse.

SCIENCE  OF  MED ICINE  I FIRST  LITERATURE  REPORT 

The pati ent was  a 69-yea r-olcl  white male who 

experi enced  two episodes of intracranial lobar 
hemorrhage  temporally associated with  PD E-5  use.  He 
had  previous  hi story of intracerebral hemorrh age  nin e 
mo nths prio r to  prese ntatio n, coronary artery disease, 
colon cancer status post  two  resecti ons,  and  subsequent 
chemo  and radiation  therapy,  erectile dysfunction 
and  hyperlipiclemi a.  He presented  to  the emergency 
depar tment with  complaints of o ne-clay  history of 
headache,  confusio n, and  in abili ty  to concentrate.  The 
headache was bifrontal in  location without radi ation, 5/ 10 
in  intensity  and  squeezing  in  character. There was no 
associated  photop hobia,  phonophobia,  nausea,  congestion 
or  lacrim ation. There was  no slurring of speech, hearing 
loss, neck stiffness  or significant weakness.  The patient 
has  been  norm otensive and  non-di abeti c throughout his 
life.  He was  on multi-vitamin , 8 1 mg aspi rin , silclenafi l 
(25 mg)  for  his erectil e dysfun ction, and  tamsulosin  for 
benign prostati c hyperp lasia. 

He had stro ng  family  hi story of coronary artery 
di sease and  myocardial  infarction.  He  had  a daughter with 
brain  aneurysm whi ch was  treated surgically.  He did  not 
smoke, drink, or use  illicit drugs.  Hi s labs were within 
normal range without abnorm al platelet count or  I  R. 
On examination,  he was  well  nourished and  in  no 
acute di stress.  The remainder of the general  examination 
was unremarkable.  On  mental status exam  he sco red 
12/ 30 on ,vtM SE  with deficits  in  all  sph eres except 
repetition  and  orientation to  place.  Hi s executive 
functions were compromised with difficulty calculating 
and  was  also  not abl e  to  follow  three step commands.  He 
was  not able  to  repeat three objects consecutively and 
fo llow written comm ands.  In  addition,  he  had  verbal  and 
action perseveration . The  remainder of the cranial  nerve 
exa m was  unremarkable. 

Motor exam was  unremarkable.  Deep tendon 
reflexes  were symm etric.  Sensation to all  modaliti es  was 
intact.  He  had  no ataxia.  Corti cal sensations incl uding 
grap hesthesia and  stereognosis were  normal. 

On  funcloscopic c,,a m, the pat ient had 

bil ateral pap illeclema.  Th e patient was  hypertensive 
( I 60/90 mmHg)  and  required  intravenous (IV)  hyclralazi ne 
fo r control of blood pressure.  While in  the emergency 
department  hi s headache  resolved  a few  hou rs after 
presentation.  He was sta rted  in  emergency  department on 
phenytoin  for seizure  prophylaxis  after  ICJ-1 . 

showed acute left  fronta l lobe bleed  and  chroni c  right 
frontal encep halo malacia  from prior  ICH  (Figu re  1) . 
About nin e  months prior to current presentation,  he  had 
presented with  a similar syndrom e and  brain CT  at that 
time showed  large  right frontal  bleed  (Figure 2-the 
remnant of this bleed  is the source  of chronic changes 
in  Figure  1).  Head  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging (MRI ) 
exam showed a left  frontal  intracerebral hemorrhage 
with both a subacute and  acute component with  minimal 
mass effect on left  lateral ventri cle  and  no  micllin e shift. 
The  MRI  was also  notable for evid ence of previous right 
fronta l hemo rrhage,  mostly resolved,  with  resultant 
enceph alomalacia.  Periventricular T2 hyperintense  signals 
were present in  the  fronta l areas  suggesting chronic small 
vessel  disease (SVD)  (see  Figure  3 current bleed,  Figu re 
4  for  prior  right bleed).  Carotid  duplex  ultrasound 
demonstrated  mild  caro tid  plac1ues  bilatera lly without 
any significant stenosis.  MRA  angiogram  of head  and 

neck were  negat ive  for  any aneurysm,  arteriovcnous 
malform ati ons or other vascular anomali es. 

On  further discussion with  the  patient's wife on  the 
second  clay  of the admission, she  noted that the  patient's 
headache  began  while they  were in  engaged  in  sexual 
intercourse.  She also  noted  they had  bee n engaged  in 
intercourse  leading up  to  the previous episode of ICH 
approximately nin e  months pri or when  the pati ent  had 
the initial  right sided  frontal intralobar hemorrh age 
(Figure 4) . She  noted the  prior headache occu rred  during 
intercourse wh ile  using tada lafil fo r erectile dysfun ction. 
She also  noted  he  had  taken  silclenafi l (2 5mg)  and  was 
engaged  in  intercourse just  prior to developmen t of th e 
headache which led  to  the current presentation, and 
discovery o f the  new left  intra lobar frontal hemorrhage 
(l' igure  3). 

The tempora l relationship of the  two occurrences  of 

ICJ-1  on two different occasions with  the use  of the  PD E-5 

inhibitors was  concerning for  possible causa lity.  It seems 
likely that type  PDE-5  inhibitor use and  sexual activity 
in  the setting of underlying vascular pathology,  possibly 
amyloicl  angiopathy,  co ntributed  to the bl eeds.  He  had 
used  PD E-5  inhi bitors several other times  in  the past, 
but not with  a great deal  of frequency.  The wife  could 
not give a detailed  history of this and  the  patient wasn't 
aware at that point and  time  hm  often  he  had  used  them. 
He  never  reported a sexual headache pri or  to  his first 
presentation of ICH.  He was  counsel ed  to stop  taking any

PD E-5  inhibi tors and  two  separate episodes of !CH 
in  different areas of the brain  in  one patient. This case 

bo lsters existing evidence that PD E-5  inhibitors as  a class 
should  be viewed with ca ution. As  of publication,  I' DA 

warns against possible card iovascular adverse reactions, 
hearing  loss,  hypotension,  and  pri ap ism, howeve r does 
not warn  that !CH  may  be possible side effect. 

Conclusion 

This case of recurrent lobar hemorrhages  revolves 
around use of PD E-5  inhibitors and  !CH  likely associated 
with  preexisting  microvascul ature patho logy,  precipitating 
ICH.  It  illustrates the  risk of intracranial  hemo rrhage 
associated  with  the use of PDE-5  inhibitors during 

sexu al intercourse.  It would  appea r to  be a particularly 
cautionary tale  in  the  instance of prior intracranial  bleed, 
or in  t he setti ng of known  cerebrovascular disease.  It  is of 

utmost importance  to discuss  the ri sks and  benefits before 
prescribing such medi cations  to  patients with  possible 

underlying vasculopathi es  ancVor  prior bleed.  If it is 
desirab le to  use these  mediations,  it  is likely prudent to 
start at  the lowest  possible dose in  these  popu latio ns.
