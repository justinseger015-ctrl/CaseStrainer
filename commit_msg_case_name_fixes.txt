FIX: Add "In re" pattern support and fix date extraction from wrong citation

USER ISSUES:
1. Many case names showing as "N/A" in unverified clusters
2. "In re Dependency of G.J.A." showing as "N/A"
3. Hamaatsa case showing wrong year (2011 instead of 2016)
4. Long tribal case names failing extraction

ROOT CAUSES FOUND:
1. Comma-anchor extraction had NO patterns for "In re" cases
2. Validation logic required " v. " pattern, rejecting ALL "In re" cases
3. Date extraction looking BEFORE case name instead of AFTER citation

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

**FIX #1: Add "In re" patterns to comma-anchor extraction**
File: unified_case_extraction_master.py (_extract_with_comma_anchor)
Added patterns:
```python
# Pattern 1: "In re" cases - greedy match to end of string
r'(In\s+re\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z\s\'&\-\.,]{3,})$',

# Pattern 2: "In re" after sentence boundary
r'(?:^|[.!?]\s+)(In\s+re\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z\s\'&\-\.,]{3,})$',
```

**FIX #2: Allow "In re" cases in validation**
File: unified_case_extraction_master.py (_looks_like_case_name)
Changed:
```python
# OLD: Required " v. " for all cases
if not text or ' v. ' not in text.lower():
    return False

# NEW: Allow "In re" OR " v. "
is_in_re_case = text and text.lower().startswith('in re ')
has_v_pattern = text and ' v. ' in text.lower()

if not text or (not has_v_pattern and not is_in_re_case):
    return False
```

Also added special validation for "In re" cases:
```python
elif is_in_re_case:
    # For "In re" cases, just check it has more than "In re"
    after_in_re = text[6:].strip()
    if len(after_in_re) < 5:
        return False
```

**FIX #3: Date extraction from wrong citation (already committed)**
File: unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py (_extract_date_from_case_context)
Fixed to look AFTER citation instead of BEFORE case name to avoid picking up
previous citation's year.

TEST RESULTS:
✓ "Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians" - PASS (was truncating to "Inc. v.")
✓ "Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Coughlin" - PASS (long name)
✓ "Kiowa Tribe v. Mfg. Techs., Inc." - PASS (corporate name with Inc.)
✗ "In re Dependency of G.J.A." - Still failing (needs more investigation)

PARTIAL SUCCESS:
- Long case names: FIXED ✓
- Corporate names with Inc.: FIXED ✓  
- Date extraction: FIXED ✓
- "In re" cases: PARTIALLY FIXED (pattern matching works, but extraction still fails)

REMAINING WORK:
The "In re" case is still returning "N/A" despite pattern matching and passing validation.
Further debugging needed to find where extraction is failing in the pipeline.

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/unified_case_extraction_master.py: Added "In re" patterns and validation
- src/unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py: Fixed date extraction (previous commit)

IMPACT:
- Better extraction for corporate names with Inc., LLC, etc.
- Better extraction for long tribal and organizational names
- Correct year extraction for parallel citations
- Foundation for "In re" case support (needs completion)
