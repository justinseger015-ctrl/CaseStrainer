    "text": "We review a trial court's findings of fact for substantial evidence, generally deferring to the trier of fact on questions of witness credibility, conflicting testimony, and persuasiveness of the evidence. In re Vulnerable Adult Petition for Knight, 178 Wn. App. 929, 936-37, 317 P.3d 1068 (2014). Evidence is substantial when sufficient to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth of the matter asserted. In re Marriage of Black, 188 Wn.2d 114, 127, 392 P.3d 1041 (2017). \"Competent evidence sufficient to support the trial court's decision to grant . . . a domestic violence protection order may contain hearsay or be wholly documentary.\" Blackmon v. Blackmon, 155 Wn. App. 715, 722, 230 P.3d 233 (2010)."
