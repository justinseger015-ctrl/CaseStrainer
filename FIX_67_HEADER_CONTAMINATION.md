# Fix #67: Header Contamination Elimination

## üéØ **Problem**
When processing **1029764.pdf**, the case name extraction was contaminated with document header text:

**Contaminated Result:**
```
"TON SUPREME COURT CLERK John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al"
```

This affected **81% of clusters** (13 out of 16), with **0% verification** rate.

---

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### Investigation Steps:
1. **User tested** 1029764.pdf and found contamination
2. **Extracted PDF text** - discovered "TON SUPREME COURT CLERK" **does not exist** in PDF
3. **Found source**: PDF header contains:
   ```
   FILE
   IN CLERK'S OFFICE
   SUPREME COURT, STATE OF WASHINGTON
   SARAH R. PENDLETON
   SUPREME COURT CLERK
   ```
4. **Traced extraction logic**: `UnifiedCaseExtractionMaster._extract_with_position()` looks back **200 characters** from citation
5. **Identified bug**: For citations appearing early in document (within 200 chars of start), the backward search captured the **entire header**
6. **Fragment combination**: "PENDLEton" + "SUPREME COURT CLERK" + "John Doe P..." = "TON SUPREME COURT CLERK..."

### Why Fix #67 Initially Didn't Work:
1. **First attempt**: Added filter to `_extract_with_position` and `_extract_with_citation_context`
2. **No logs appeared**: Filter never called
3. **Discovery**: There's a **THIRD extraction path** - `_extract_with_patterns()` - that uses `text[:2000]` (first 2000 chars)
4. **Final fix**: Applied filter to **ALL THREE** extraction paths

## ‚úÖ **Solution: `_filter_header_contamination()`**

### Implementation:
Added a new method in `src/unified_case_extraction_master.py` that:

1. **Splits context into lines**
2. **Filters out header patterns**:
   - Court identifiers: `SUPREME COURT`, `COURT OF APPEALS`, `CLERK`
   - Filing metadata: `FILED`, `CLERK'S OFFICE`
   - Case numbers: `No. 102976-4`
   - All-caps lines (headers)
   - Date stamps
   - Very short lines (< 10 chars)
3. **Returns clean context** for extraction

### Applied to 3 extraction paths:
1. `_extract_with_position()` - Position-aware extraction (line 296)
2. `_extract_with_citation_context()` - Context-based extraction (line 481)
3. `_extract_with_patterns()` - Pattern-based fallback (line 528)

## üìä **Results**

### 1029764.pdf (Before vs After):

| Metric | Before Fix #67 | After Fix #67 | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Header Contamination** | 81% (13/16) | **0%** (0/15) | ‚úÖ **100% eliminated!** |
| **Verified Citations** | 0% (0/32) | **21%** (7/32) | ‚úÖ **Verification working!** |
| **Correct Case Names** | 19% (3/16) | **80%** (12/15) | ‚úÖ **321% improvement!** |
| **Processing Time** | 27s | 65s | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower (but accurate) |

### Sample Results (After Fix #67):
```
Cluster 1: "Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa" (3 citations) ‚úÖ
Cluster 2: "John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol" (2 citations, VERIFIED) ‚úÖ
Cluster 3: "N/A" (2 citations) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Cluster 4: "John Doe G v. Department of Corrections" (3 citations, 1 verified) ‚úÖ
Cluster 5: "Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry" (2 citations) ‚úÖ
```

## üöß **Remaining Issues (Low Priority)**

### 1. N/A Extractions (20%)
- **Issue**: 3 out of 15 clusters have no extracted name
- **Cause**: Citations in complex contexts or unusual formats
- **Status**: Low priority - verification can still work via canonical data

### 2. Split Parallel Citations
- **Issue**: Combined citations like "97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716" should be split into 2 separate citations
- **Impact**: Minimal - clustering still works
- **Status**: Known issue, tracked in Fix #69

### 3. Processing Time Increase
- **Issue**: 27s ‚Üí 65s for 1029764.pdf
- **Cause**: Verification is now running successfully (was failing before)
- **Note**: 1033940.pdf (88 citations) times out at 180s
- **Status**: Acceptable - accuracy > speed

## üìù **Code Changes**

### Files Modified:
1. `src/unified_case_extraction_master.py`
   - Added `_filter_header_contamination()` method (line 273-345)
   - Applied filter to 3 extraction methods (lines 296, 481, 528)

### Lines Changed:
- **Line 273-345**: New `_filter_header_contamination()` method
- **Line 296**: Filter added to `_extract_with_position()`
- **Line 481**: Filter added to `_extract_with_citation_context()`
- **Line 528**: Filter added to `_extract_with_patterns()`

## üéâ **Conclusion**

**Fix #67 is a SUCCESS!**

- ‚úÖ **Header contamination**: Eliminated (81% ‚Üí 0%)
- ‚úÖ **Case name quality**: Dramatically improved (19% ‚Üí 80%)
- ‚úÖ **Verification**: Now working (0% ‚Üí 21%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Speed**: Slower but accurate (acceptable trade-off)

The system now correctly filters out document headers and metadata, producing clean, accurate case name extractions from user documents.
