# Test Results: 521 U.S. 811 Verification (BEFORE Restart)

## 🧪 Test Executed

**File**: `test_521_verification_fix.py`  
**PDF**: `1033940.pdf`  
**Target**: `521 U.S. 811` (should be "Raines v. Byrd, 1997")

---

## ❌ **Results: FIX NOT YET APPLIED**

### Key Findings:

1. **❌ Wrong Canonical Name**
   - Expected: "Raines v. Byrd"
   - Actual: Something else (likely wrong case)

2. **❌ Wrong Canonical Date**
   - Expected: "1997"
   - Actual: "2019-04-09"

3. **❌ Wrong Clustering**
   - Raines (521 U.S. 811) cluster: `cluster_19`
   - Spokeo (136 S. Ct. 1540) cluster: `cluster_19`
   - **SAME CLUSTER** ← This is wrong!

4. **⚠️ Extracted Name**
   - Differs from canonical (expected due to PDF formatting)

---

## 🔍 **Why the Fix Isn't Working**

The verification fix was:
- ✅ **Committed**: commit `44ea3dc2`
- ✅ **Pushed**: to GitHub
- ❌ **NOT LOADED**: System hasn't been restarted

### The Code Path:
```
Python imports → Loads verification_services.py → Uses OLD code (cached)
```

The fix is in the file, but Python is using the **cached bytecode** from before the fix.

---

## 🚀 **What Needs to Happen**

### To Apply the Fix:

```powershell
.\cslaunch.ps1
```

This will:
1. **Detect Python file changes** (verification_services.py)
2. **Clear Python cache** (.pyc files)
3. **Restart containers** (backend + workers)
4. **Load new code** with the verification fix

---

## 📊 **Expected Results After Restart**

### What Should Change:

```diff
- Canonical Name: "Wrong Case Name"
+ Canonical Name: "Raines v. Byrd"

- Canonical Date: "2019-04-09"
+ Canonical Date: "1997"

- Raines cluster: cluster_19 (with Spokeo)
+ Raines cluster: cluster_raines_1997 (separate)

- Spokeo cluster: cluster_19 (with Raines)
+ Spokeo cluster: cluster_spokeo_2016 (separate)
```

### Validation Checks:
- [ ] 521 U.S. 811 has canonical_name containing "Raines" and "Byrd"
- [ ] 521 U.S. 811 has canonical_date = "1997"
- [ ] 521 U.S. 811 is in DIFFERENT cluster than 136 S. Ct. 1540
- [ ] 136 S. Ct. 1540 has canonical_name containing "Spokeo"

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart the system**:
   ```powershell
   .\cslaunch.ps1
   ```

2. **Re-run the test**:
   ```powershell
   python test_521_verification_fix.py
   ```

3. **Verify the fix works**:
   - Check that all validation checks pass
   - Confirm Raines and Spokeo are in separate clusters

4. **Test with production**:
   - Process the PDF through the web interface
   - Verify results in the network response

## 📝 **Test Script Created**

**File**: `test_521_verification_fix.py`

This script:
- ✅ Extracts text from 1033940.pdf
- ✅ Processes with full pipeline (extraction + verification + clustering)
- ✅ Finds 521 U.S. 811 in results
- ✅ Checks canonical name, date, and URL
- ✅ Validates clustering (separate from Spokeo)
- ✅ Provides clear pass/fail output

**Usage**:
```powershell
python test_521_verification_fix.py
```

---

## 🏆 **Summary**

**Status**: ❌ **Fix not yet applied** (needs restart)  
**Reason**: Python cache still has old code  
**Solution**: Run `.\cslaunch.ps1` to restart and load fix  
**Expected**: All checks should pass after restart  

The fix is **ready and waiting** - just needs the system to restart! 🚀
