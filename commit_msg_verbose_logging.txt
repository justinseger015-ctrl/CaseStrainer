Add verbose diagnostic logging for canonical data extraction

Problem: Cluster canonical data extraction appears to run but most clusters
still show "N/A" in frontend. Need to diagnose why.

Changes (src/progress_manager.py):
1. Changed logger.info() to logger.error() for visibility
2. Added detailed logging for each cluster processed
3. Log each citation's verified status and canonical_name presence
4. Count and report clusters with vs without canonical data
5. Log when no verified citations found in cluster

This verbose logging will help identify:
- Are verified citations missing canonical_name?
- Are clusters empty?
- Which specific clusters succeed vs fail?

Expected output in logs:
- "üîç CANONICAL DATA EXTRACTION: Processing X clusters"
- "üîç Cluster has X citations"
- "üîç Citation: verified=True/False, has_canonical=True/False"  
- "‚úÖ Found verified citation with canonical: [name]"
- "‚ö†Ô∏è No verified citation with canonical data found in this cluster"
- "üìä CANONICAL DATA SUMMARY: X/Y clusters have canonical data"

Next: Resubmit PDF and examine worker logs to diagnose issue
