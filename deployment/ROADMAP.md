# CaseStrainer Enhancement Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements for CaseStrainer, providing a comprehensive roadmap for future development. These features will significantly expand CaseStrainer's capabilities for legal citation verification and analysis.

## 1. Citation Network Visualization

**Description:** Create interactive visualizations showing relationships between citations across different legal documents.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive network graph showing citation relationships
- Heat maps highlighting patterns of unconfirmed citations
- Visualization of citation propagation across different courts and documents
- Filtering options to focus on specific citation types or confidence levels

**Technical Requirements:**
- JavaScript visualization libraries (D3.js or Vis.js)
- Backend data processing for network generation
- Optimized data structures for large citation networks

## 2. Machine Learning Citation Classifier

**Description:** Develop a machine learning model to predict citation reliability without requiring API calls.

**Key Features:**
- Train on the growing database of confirmed and unconfirmed citations
- Identify patterns in citation formats that tend to be unreliable
- Provide confidence scores for new citations
- Continuous learning from new verification results

**Technical Requirements:**
- Machine learning pipeline (scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
- Feature extraction from citation text and context
- Model versioning and performance tracking
- Periodic retraining schedule

## 3. Citation Export and Integration

**Description:** Allow users to export citation data and integrate with other legal research tools.

**Key Features:**
- Export to common citation formats (BibTeX, EndNote, Zotero)
- Browser extensions to verify citations on legal websites
- Generate citation reports for legal teams
- Integration with legal document management systems

**Technical Requirements:**
- Export format templates
- Browser extension development
- Report generation module
- API endpoints for third-party integration

## 4. Advanced Search and Filtering

**Description:** Enhance search capabilities for more precise citation discovery and analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Full-text search across citation explanations and context
- Filter by multiple criteria simultaneously (court, date range, confidence)
- Save and share search queries
- Semantic search for finding similar citations

**Technical Requirements:**
- Advanced search indexing
- Query builder interface
- Saved search persistence
- Semantic similarity algorithms

## 5. Citation Correction Suggestions

**Description:** Provide intelligent suggestions for correcting unconfirmed citations.

**Key Features:**
- Suggest similar verified citations that might be the intended reference
- "Did you mean" alternatives based on case names or numbers
- Allow users to submit corrections
- Learning system to improve suggestions over time

**Technical Requirements:**
- String similarity algorithms
- Suggestion ranking system
- User feedback collection
- Correction history tracking

## 6. Batch Processing Improvements

**Description:** Enhance the system's ability to process large volumes of documents efficiently.

**Key Features:**
- Process entire directories of legal documents
- Schedule regular scans of court websites for new briefs
- Create a processing queue for large document collections
- Parallel processing for faster analysis

**Technical Requirements:**
- Task queue system (Celery or similar)
- Scheduler for periodic tasks
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Distributed processing capabilities

## 7. User Accounts and Collaboration

**Description:** Add multi-user functionality to enable team collaboration on citation verification.

**Key Features:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Team workspaces for collaborative verification
- Track which citations have been manually verified
- Share annotations and notes about problematic citations

**Technical Requirements:**
- User management system
- Collaboration data models
- Activity tracking
- Notification system

## 8. API Access

**Description:** Create a comprehensive API for programmatic access to CaseStrainer.

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API for citation verification
- Bulk processing through API calls
- Webhook notifications for newly discovered unconfirmed citations
- API key management and usage tracking

**Technical Requirements:**
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Webhook implementation
- Usage analytics

## Implementation Timeline

This roadmap represents a significant expansion of CaseStrainer's capabilities. Implementation will be phased according to the following priorities:

### Phase 1 (1-3 months)
- Advanced Search and Filtering
- Citation Export and Integration
- Batch Processing Improvements

### Phase 2 (3-6 months)
- Machine Learning Citation Classifier
- Citation Correction Suggestions
- API Access

### Phase 3 (6-12 months)
- Citation Network Visualization
- User Accounts and Collaboration

## Conclusion

These enhancements will transform CaseStrainer from a citation verification tool into a comprehensive platform for legal citation management and analysis. The implementation will focus on delivering incremental value while building toward the complete vision.

Feedback on this roadmap is welcome and will help prioritize development efforts.
