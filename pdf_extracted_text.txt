CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No. 22–451. Argued January 17, 2024—Decided June 28, 2024* The Court granted certiorari in th ese cases limited to the question whether Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, should be overru led or clarified. Under the Chev- ron doctrine, courts have sometimes been required to defer to “permis- sible” agency interpretations of th e statutes those agencies adminis- ter—even when a reviewing court reads the statute differently. Id. , at 843. In each case below, the reviewing courts applied Chevron ’s frame- work to resolve in favor of the Go vernment challenges by petitioners to a rule promulgated by the Nati onal Marine Fisheries Service pur- suant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S. C. §1801 et seq. , which incorporates the Administrative Proc edure Act (APA), 5 U.S. C. §551 et seq . Held : The Administrative Proc edure Act requires cour ts to exercise their independent judgment in deciding wh ether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and courts may not defer to an agency inter - pretation of the law simply be cause a statute is ambiguous; Chevron is overruled. Pp. 7–35. (a) Article III of the Constitution assigns to the Federal Judiciary the responsibility and power to ad judicate “Cases” and “Controver- sies”—concrete disputes with consequences for the parties involved. The Framers appreciated that the laws judges would necessarily apply in resolving those disputes would no t always be clear, but envisioned —————— *Together with No. 22–1219, Relentless , Inc., et al. v. Department of Commerce, et al. , on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 2 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Syllabus that the final “interpretation of the laws” would be “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 525 (A.Ham- ilton). As Chief Justice Marshall de clared in the foundational decision of Marbury v. Madison , “[i]t is emphatically th e province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” 1 Cranch 137, 177. In the decades following Marbury , when the meaning of a statute was at issue, the judicial role was to “inter pret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties.” Decatur v. Paulding , 14 Pet. 497, 515. The Court recognized from the outset, though, that exercising inde- pendent judgment often included according due respect to Executive Branch interpretations of federal statutes. Such respect was thought especially warranted when an Executive Branch interpretation was is- sued roughly contemporaneously wi th enactment of the statute and remained consistent over time. The Court also gave “the most respect-ful consideration” to Executive Bran ch interpretations simply because “[t]he officers concerned [were] usually able men, and masters of the subject,” who may well have dr afted the laws at issue. United States v. Moore , 95 U.S. 760, 763. “Respect,” though, was just that. The views of the Executive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judi- ciary, but did not supersede it. “[I] n cases where [a court’s] own judg- ment . . . differ[ed] from that of ot her high functionaries,” the court was “not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.” United States v. Dickson , 15 Pet. 141, 162 . During the “rapid expansion of th e administrative process” that took place during the New Deal era, United States v. Morton Salt Co. , 338 U.S. 632, 644, the Court often tr eated agency determinations of fact as binding on the courts, provided that there was “evidence to support the findings,” St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States , 298 U.S. 38, 51. But the Court did not extend similar deference to agency reso - lutions of questions of law. “The interpretation of the meaning of stat- utes, as applied to justiciable cont roversies,” remained “exclusively a judicial function.” United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc. , 310 U.S. 534, 544. The Court also continued to note that the informed judgment of the Executive Branch coul d be entitled to “great weight.” Id., at 549. “The weight of such a judgment in a particular case,” the Court observed, would “depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reas oning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all thos e factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140. Occasionally during this period , the Court applied deferential re- view after concluding that a particular statute empowered an agencyto decide how a broad statutory term applied to specific facts found by 3 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Syllabus the agency. See Gray v. Powell , 314 U.S. 402; NLRB v. Hearst Publi- cations, Inc. , 322 U.S. 111. But such deferential review, which the Court was far from consistent in applying, was cabined to factbound determinations. And the Court di d not purport to refashion the longstanding judicial approach to questions of law. It instead pro- claimed that “[u]ndoubtedly question s of statutory interpretation . . . are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute.” Id., at 130–131. Nothing in the New Deal era or before it thus resem- bled the deference rule the Court would begin applying decades later to all varieties of agency inte rpretations of statutes under Chevron . Pp. 7–13. (b) Congress in 1946 enacted the APA “as a check upon administra - tors whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to excesses not con - templated in legislation creating their offices.” Morton Salt, 338 U.S., at 644. The APA prescribes proced ures for agency action and deline- ates the basic contours of judicial revi ew of such action. And it codifies for agency cases the unremarkable, yet elemental proposition reflected by judicial practice dating back to Marbury : that courts decide legal questions by applying th eir own judgment. As relevant here, the APA specifies that courts, not agencies, will decide “ all relevant questions of law” arising on review of agency action, 5 U.S. C. §706 (emphasis added)—even those involving ambiguou s laws. It prescribes no defer- ential standard for courts to empl oy in answering those legal ques- tions, despite mandating deferential judicial review of agency policy - making and factfinding. See §§706(2)(A), (E). And by directing courtsto “interpret constitutional and st atutory provisions” without differen- tiating between the two, §706, it makes clear that agency interpreta- tions of statutes—like agency interp retations of the Constitution—are not entitled to deference. The APA’s history and the contemporaneous views of various respected commentators underscore the plain mean- ing of its text. Courts exercising independent judgment in dete rmining the mean- ing of statutory provisions, consis tent with the APA, may—as they have from the start—seek aid from the interpretations of those respon- sible for implementing pa rticular statutes. See Skidmore , 323 U.S., at 140. And when the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency , the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to in dependently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by recognizin g constitutional delegations, fixing the boundaries of the delegated auth ority, and ensuri ng the agency has engaged in “ ‘reasoned decisionma king’ ” within those boundaries. Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743, 750 (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & 4 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Syllabus Service, Inc. v. NLRB , 522 U.S. 359, 374). By doing so, a court upholds the traditional conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts.Pp. 13–18. (c)The deference that Chevron requires of courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.Pp. 18–29. (1) Chevron , decided in 1984 by a bare quorum of six Justices, trig - gered a marked departure from the traditional judicial approach of in- dependently examining each statute to determine its meaning. The question in the case was whether an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation was consistent with the term “stationary source” as used in the Clean Air Act. 467 U.S., at 840. To answer that question, the Court articulated and employed a now familiar two-step approach broadly applicable to review of agen cy action. The first step was to discern “whether Congress ha[d] dire ctly spoken to the precise ques- tion at issue.” Id., at 842. The Court explained that “[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter,” ibid. , and courts were therefore to “reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent,” id., at 843, n. 9. But in a case in which “the statute [was] silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand, a reviewing court could not “simply impose its own constructionon the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administra-tive interpretation.” Id. , at 843 (footnote omitted) . Instead, at Chev- ron’s second step, a court had to defer to the agency if it had offered “a permissible construction of the statute,” ibid. , even if not “the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding,” ibid. , n. 11. Employing this new test, the Court concluded that Congress had not addr essed the question at issue with the necessary “level of specificity” and that EPA’s interpretation was “entitled to deference.” Id., at 865. Although the Court did not at first treat Chevron as the watershed decision it was fated to become, th e Court and the courts of appeals were soon routinely invoking its framework as the governing standard in cases involving statutory questions of agency authority. The Court eventually decided that Chevron rested on “a presumption that Con- gress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. , 517 U.S. 735, 740–741. Pp. 18–20. (2) Neither Chevron nor any subsequent decision of the Court at - tempted to reconcile its framework with the APA.Chevron defies the command of the APA that “the revi ewing court”—not the agency whose 5 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Syllabus action it reviews—is to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “in- terpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (emphasis added). It requires a court to ignore , not follow, “the reading the court would have reached” had it exercised its indepe ndent judgment as required by the APA.Chevron , 467 U.S., at 843, n. 11. Chevron insists on more than the “respect” historically given to Ex ecutive Branch inte rpretations; it demands that courts mechanically afford binding deference to agency interpretations, including those that have been inconsistent over time, see id., at 863, and even when a pre-existing judicial precedent holds that an ambiguous statute means something else, National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services , 545 U.S. 967, 982. That regime is the antithesis of the time honored approach the APA prescribes. Chevron cannot be reconciled with the APA by presuming that stat - utory ambiguities are implicit delegations to agencies. That presump - tion does not approximate reality. A statutory ambiguity does not nec- essarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question. Many or perhaps most statutory ambiguities may be unintentional. And when courts confront statutory ambiguities in cases that do not involve agency in - terpretations or delegations of au thority, they are not somehow re - lieved of their obligation to independently interpret the statutes. In- stead of declaring a particular party’s reading “permissible” in such a case, courts use every tool at their disposal to determine the best read- ing of the statute and resolve the ambi guity. But in an agency case as in any other, there is a best reading all the same—“the reading the court would have reached” if no agency were involved. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 843, n. 11. It therefore makes no sense to speak of a “permis- sible” interpretation that is not th e one the court, after applying all relevant interpretive tools, concludes is best. Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron ’s presumption is misguided because agencies have no special comp etence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do. The Framers anticipated that courts would often confront statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment. Chevron gravely erred in concluding that the inquiry is fundamentally different just because an administrative interpretation is in play. The very point of the traditional tools of statut ory construction is to resolve stat- utory ambiguities. That is no less true when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency’s own powe r—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is least appropriate. Pp. 21–23. (3) The Government responds that Congress must generally in - tend for agencies to resolve stat utory ambiguities because agencies have subject matter expertise regard ing the statutes they administer; 6 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Syllabus because deferring to agencies purp ortedly promotes the uniform con - struction of federal law; and becaus e resolving statutory ambiguities can involve policymaking best left to political actors, rather than courts. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 16–19. But none of these considerations justifies Chevron ’s sweeping presumption of congressional intent. As the Court recently noted, interpretive issues arising in connec- tion with a regulatory scheme “may fall more naturally into a judge’s bailiwick” than an agency’s. Kisor v. Wilkie , 588 U.S. 558, 578. Under Chevron ’s broad rule of deference, th ough, ambiguities of all stripes trigger deference, even in cases havi ng little to do with an agency ’s technical subject matter expertise. And even when an ambiguity hap- pens to implicate a technical matter, it does not follow that Congress has taken the power to authoritatively interpret the statute from the courts and given it to the agency. Congress expects courts to handle technical statutory questions, and courts did so without issue in agency cases before Chevron . After all, in an agen cy case in particular, the reviewing court will go about its task with the agency’s “body of experience and informed judgment,” among other information, at its disposal. Skidmore , 323 U.S., at 140. An agency’s interpretation of a statute “cannot bind a court,” but may be especially informative “to theextent it rests on factual premises within [the agency’s] expertise.” Bu- reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA , 464 U.S. 89, 98, n. 8. Delegating ultimate interpretive au thority to agencies is simply not necessary to ensure that the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well informed by subject matter expertise. Nor does a desire for the uniform construction of federal law justify Chevron . It is unclear how much the Chevron doctrine as a whole ac- tually promotes such uniformity, and in any event, we see no reason to presume that Congress prefers unifo rmity for uniformity’s sake over the correct interpretation of the laws it enacts. Finally, the view that interpreta tion of ambiguous statutory provi- sions amounts to policymaking suited for political actors rather than courts is especially mistaken becaus e it rests on a pr ofound misconcep - tion of the judicial role. Resoluti on of statutory ambiguities involves legal interpretation, and that task does not suddenly become policy- making just because a court has an “agency to fall back on.” Kisor, 588 U.S., at 575. Courts interpret statutes, no matter the context, based on the traditional tools of statutory construction, not individual policy preferences. To stay out of discre tionary policymaking left to the po- litical branches, judges need only fulfill their obligations under the APA to independently identify and re spect such delegations of author- ity, police the outer statutory boundar ies of those delegations, and en- sure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the APA. 7 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Syllabus By forcing courts to instead preten d that ambiguities are necessarily delegations, Chevron prevents judges from judging. Pp. 23–26. (4) Because Chevron ’s justifying presumpt ion is, as Members of the Court have often recognized, a fi ction, the Court has spent the bet - ter part of four decades imposing one limitation on Chevron after an- other. Confronted with the byzant ine set of preconditions and excep- tions that has resulted, some courts have simply bypassed Chevron or failed to heed its various steps and nuances. The Court, for its part, has not deferred to an agency interpretation under Chevron since 2016. But because Chevron remains on the books, litigants must con- tinue to wrestle with it, and lower courts—bound by even the Court’s crumbling precedents—understandably continue to apply it. At best, Chevron has been a distraction from th e question that matters: Does the statute authorize the challenged agency action? And at worst, it has required courts to violate the APA by yielding to an agency the express responsibility, vested in “the reviewing court ,” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “inter pret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (emphasis added). Pp. 26–29. (d) Stare decisis , the doctrine governing judicial adherence to prece- dent, does not require the Court to persist in the Chevron project. The stare decisis considerations most relevant here—“the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning, the workability of the rule it established, . . . and reliance on the decision,” Knick v. Township of Scott, 588 U.S. 180, 203 (quoting Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees , 585 U.S. 878, 917)—all weigh in favor of letting Chevron go. Chevron has proved to be fundamentally misguided. It reshaped ju - dicial review of agency action wi thout grappling with the APA, the statute that lays out how such review works. And its flaws were ap-parent from the start, prompting th e Court to revise its foundations and continually limit its application. Experience has also shown that Chevron is unworkable. The defin- ing feature of its framework is the identification of statutory ambigu- ity, but the concept of ambiguity has always evaded meaningful defi- nition. Such an impressionistic and malleable concept “cannot stand as an every-day test for allocati ng” interpretive authority between courts and agencies. Swift & Co. v. Wickham , 382 U.S. 111, 125. The Court has also been forced to clarify the doctrine again and again, only adding to Chevron ’s unworkability, and the doctrine continues to spawn difficult threshold questions that promise to further complicate the inquiry should Chevron be retained. And its continuing import is far from clear, as courts have ofte n declined to engage with the doc - trine, saying it makes no difference. Nor has Chevron fostered meaningful relia nce. Given the Court’s constant tinkering with and eventual turn away from Chevron , it is 8 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Syllabus hard to see how anyone could reasonably expect a court to rely on Chev- ron in any particular case or expect it to produce readily foreseeable outcomes. And rather than sa feguarding reliance interests, Chevron affirmatively destroys them by allowing agencies to change course even when Congress has given them no power to do so. The only way to “ensure that th e law will not merely change errati- cally, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion,” Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U.S. 254, 265, is for the Court to leave Chevron behind. By overruling Chevron , though, the Court does not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework. The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful—including the Clean Air Act holding of Chevron itself—are still subject to statutory stare decisis despite the Court’s change in interpretive methodology. See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries , 553 U.S. 442, 457. Mere reliance on Chevron cannot constitute a “ ‘special justification’ ” for overruling such a holding. Halliburton Co. v.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos. 22–451 and 22–1219 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES, ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–451 v. GINA RAIMONDO, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE, ET AL . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT RELENTLESS, INC., ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–1219 v. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, ET AL . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT [June 28, 2024] CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court. Since our decision in Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Re- sources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984), we have sometimes required courts to de fer to “permissible” agency interpretations of the statutes those agencies administer— even when a reviewing court re ads the statute differently. In these cases we consider whether that doctrine should be overruled. I Our Chevron doctrine requires courts to use a two-step 2 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court framework to interpret statutes administered by federal agencies. After determining that a case satisfies the vari- ous preconditions we have set for Chevron to apply, a re- viewing court must first asse ss “whether Congress has di - rectly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Id., at 842. If, and only if, congressional inte nt is “clear,” that is the end of the inquiry. Ibid. But if the court determines that “the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand, the court must, at Chevron ’s second step, defer to the agency’s interpretation if it “is based on a per- missible construction of the statute.” Id., at 843. The re- viewing courts in each of the cases before us applied Chev - ron’s framework to resolve in favor of the Government challenges to the same agency rule. A Before 1976, unregulated foreign vessels dominated fish- ing in the international waters off the U.S. coast, which be-gan just 12 nautical miles offshore. See, e.g., S.Rep. No. 94–459, pp. 2–3 (1975). Recognizing the resultant over-fishing and the need for sound management of fishery re- sources, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA). See 90 Stat. 331 (codified as amended at 16 U.S. C. §1801 et seq.). The MSA and subsequent amendments extended the jurisdic- tion of the United States to 200 nautical miles beyond the U.S. territorial sea and claimed “exclusive fishery manage - ment authority over all fish” within that area, known as the“exclusive economic zone.” §1811(a); see Presidential Proc- lamation No. 5030, 3 CFR 22 (1983 Comp.); §§101, 102, 90Stat. 336. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administers the MSA under a delegation from the Secretary of Commerce. The MSA established eight regional fishery management councils composed of representatives from the coastalStates, fishery stakeholders, and NMFS.See 16 U.S. C. 3 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court §§1852(a), (b). The councils develop fishery management plans, which NMFS approves and promulgates as final reg- ulations. See §§1852(h), 1854(a). In service of the statute’s fishery conservation and management goals, see §1851(a), the MSA requires that certain provisions—such as “a mech- anism for specifying annual catch limits . . . at a level such that overfishing does not occur,” §1853(a)(15)—be included in these plans, see §1853(a). The plans may also includeadditional discretionary provis ions. See §1853(b). For ex- ample, plans may “prohibit, limit, condition, or require the use of specified types and quantities of fishing gear, fishing vessels, or equipment,” §1853(b)(4); “reserve a portion of the allowable biological catch of the fishery for use in scientific research,” §1853(b)(11); and “prescribe such other measures, requirements, or conditions and restrictions as are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the con-servation and management of the fishery,” §1853(b)(14). Relevant here, a plan may also require that “one or more observers be carried on board” domestic vessels “for the pur- pose of collecting data necessa ry for the conservation and management of the fishery.” §1853(b)(8). The MSA speci- fies three groups that must co ver costs associated with ob- servers: (1) foreign fishing vessels operating within the ex-clusive economic zone (which must carry observers), see §§1821(h)(1)(A), (h)(4), (h)(6); (2) vessels participating incertain limited access privilege programs, which imposequotas permitting fishermen to harvest only specific quan- tities of a fishery’s total allowable catch, see §§1802(26), 1853a(c)(1)(H), (e)(2), 1854(d)(2); and (3) vessels within the jurisdiction of the North Pacific Council, where many of the largest and most successful co mmercial fishing enterprises in the Nation operate, see §1862(a). In the latter two cases, the MSA expressly caps the rele vant fees at two or three percent of the value of fish harvested on the vessels. See §§1854(d)(2)(B), 1862(b)(2)(E). And in general, it author- 4 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court izes the Secretary to impose “sanctions” when “any pay - ment required for observer services provided to or con- tracted by an owner or operator . . . has not been paid.” §1858(g)(1)(D). The MSA does not contain similar terms addressing whether Atlantic herring fi shermen may be required to bear costs associated with any observers a plan may man - date. And at one point, NMFS fully funded the observer coverage the New England Fishery Management Council required in its plan for the Atlantic herring fishery. See 79 Fed. Reg. 8792 (2014). In 2013, however, the council pro-posed amending its fishery management plans to empower it to require fishermen to pay for observers if federal fund- ing became unavailable. Several years later, NMFS prom-ulgated a rule approving the amendment. See 85 Fed. Reg. 7414 (2020). With respect to the Atlantic herring fishery, the Rule cre- ated an industry funded program that aims to ensure ob - server coverage on 50 percent of trips undertaken by vessels with certain types of permits. Under that program, vessel representatives must “declare into” a fishery before begin- ning a trip by notifying NMFS of the trip and announcing the species the vessel intends to harvest. If NMFS deter- mines that an observer is required, but declines to assign a Government-paid one, the vessel must contract with and pay for a Government-certified third-party observer. NMFS estimated that the cost of such an observer would be up to $710 per day, reducing annual returns to the vessel owner by up to 20 percent. See id. , at 7417–7418. B Petitioners Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc., H&L Axels- son, Inc., Lund Marr Trawlers LLC, and Scombrus One LLC are family businesses that operate in the Atlantic her- ring fishery. In February 2020, they challenged the Rule under the MSA, 16 U.S. C. §1855(f ), which incorporates 5 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court the Administrative Procedure Ac t (APA), 5 U.S. C. §551 et seq. In relevant part, they argued that the MSA does not authorize NMFS to mandate that they pay for observers re- quired by a fishery management plan. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Government. It con- cluded that the MSA authorized the Rule, but noted that even if these petitioners’ “arguments were enough to raise an ambiguity in the statutory text,” deference to the agency’s interpretation would be warranted under Chevron . 544 F.Supp. 3d 82, 107 (DC 2021); see id., at 103–107. A divided panel of the D.C. Circuit affirmed. See 45 F. 359 (2022). The majority addressed various provi- sions of the MSA and concluded that it was not “wholly un- ambiguous” whether NMFS may require Atlantic herring fishermen to pay for observers. Id., at 366. Because there remained “some question” as to Congress’s intent, id., at 369, the court proceeded to Chevron ’s second step and de - ferred to the agency’s interpre tation as a “reasonable” con- struction of the MSA, 45 F. 4th, at 370. In dissent, JudgeWalker concluded that Congress’s silence on industry funded observers for the Atl antic herring fishery—coupled with the express provision for such observers in other fish- eries and on foreign vessels—unambiguously indicated that NMFS lacked the authority to “require [Atlantic herring] fishermen to pay the wages of at-sea monitors.” Id., at 375. C Petitioners Relentless Inc., Huntress Inc., and Seafreeze Fleet LLC own two vessels that operate in the Atlantic her- ring fishery: the F/V Relentless and the F/V Persistence . 1 These vessels use small-mesh bottom-trawl gear and can freeze fish at sea, so they can catch more species of fish and take longer trips than other vessels (about 10 to 14 days, as —————— 1For any landlubbers, “F/V” is simply the designation for a fishing ves- sel. 6 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court opposed to the more typical 2 to 4). As a result, they gener- ally declare into multiple fish eries per trip so they can catch whatever the ocean offers up. If the vessels declare into the Atlantic herring fishery for a particular trip, they must carry an observer for that trip if NMFS selects the trip for coverage, even if they end up harvesting fewer herring than other vessels—or no herring at all. This set of petitioners, like those in the D.C. Circuit case, filed a suit challenging the Rule as unauthorized by the MSA.The District Court, like th e D.C. Circuit, deferred to NMFS’s contrary interpretation under Chevron and thus granted summary judgment to the Government. See 561 F.Supp. 3d 226, 234–238 (RI 2021). The First Circuit affirmed. See 62 F. 621 (2023). It relied on a “default norm” that regulated entities must bear compliance costs, as well as the MSA’s sanctions provision, Section 1858(g)(1)(D). See id., at 629–631. And it rejected petitioners’ argument that th e express statutory authoriza- tion of three industry funding programs demonstrated that NMFS lacked the broad implicit authority it asserted to im - pose such a program for the Atlantic herring fishery. See id., at 631–633. The court ultimately concluded that the “[a]gency’s interpretation of its authority to require at-sea monitors who are paid for by owners of regulated vessels does not ‘exceed[ ] the bounds of the permissible.’ ” Id. , at 633–634 (quoting Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 218 (2002); alteration in original). In reaching that conclusion, the First Circuit stated that it was applying Chevron ’s two- step framework. 62 F. 4th, at 628. But it did not explain which aspects of its analysis were relevant to which of Chevron ’s two steps. Similarly, it declined to decide whether the result was “a product of Chevron step one or step two.” Id., at 634. We granted certiorari in both cases, limited to the ques- tion whether Chevron should be overruled or clarified.

The Framers appreciated that the laws judges would necessarily apply in resolving those dis-putes would not always be clear. Cognizant of the limits of human language and foresight, they anticipated that “[a]llnew laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill,and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation,” would be “more or less obscure and equivocal, until their meaning” was settled “by a series of particular discussions and adjudications.” The Federalist No. 37, p. 236 (J.Cooke ed. 1961) (J.Madison). The Framers also envisioned that the final “interpreta- tion of the laws” would be “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.” Id., No. 78, at 525 (A.Hamilton). Unlike the political branches, the courts would by design exercise “nei-ther Force nor Will, but merely judgment.” Id., at 523. To ensure the “steady, upright and impartial administration ofthe laws,” the Framers structured the Constitution to allow judges to exercise that judgment independent of influence from the political branches. Id., at 522; see id., at 522–524; Stern v. Marshall , 564 U.S. 462, 484 (2011). This Court embraced the Framers’ understanding of the judicial function early on. In the foundational decision of Marbury v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall famously de - clared that “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” 1 Cranch 137, —————— 2Both petitions also presented ques tions regarding the consistency of the Rule with the MSA.See Pet. fo r Cert. in No. 22–451, p. i; Pet. for Cert. in No. 22–1219, p. ii. We did not grant certiorari with respect to those questions and thus do not reach them. 8 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court 177 (1803). And in the following decades, the Court under- stood “interpret[ing] the laws, in the last resort,” to be a “solemn duty” of the Judiciary. United States v. Dickson , 15 Pet. 141, 162 (1841) (Story, J., for the Court). When the meaning of a statute was at issue, the judicial role was to “interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties.” Decatur v. Paulding , 14 Pet. 497, 515 (1840). The Court also recognized from the outset, though, that exercising independent judgment often included according due respect to Executive Branch interpretations of federal statutes. For example, in Edwards’ Lessee v. Darby , 12 Wheat. 206 (1827), the Court explained that “[i]n the con - struction of a doubtful and ambiguous law, the contempo- raneous construction of those who were called upon to actunder the law, and were appointed to carry its provisions into effect, is entitled to very great respect.” Id., at 210; see also United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch 368, 372 (1809) (Mar- shall, C.J., for the Court). Such respect was thought especially warranted when an Executive Branch interpretation was issued roughly con-temporaneously with enactment of the statute and re - mained consistent over time. See Dickson , 15 Pet., at 161; United States v. Alabama Great Southern R.Co. , 142 U.S. 615, 621 (1892); National Lead Co. v. United States , 252 U.S. 140, 145–146 (1920). That is because “the longstand- ing ‘practice of the government’ ”—like any other interpre - tive aid—“can inform [a court’ s] determination of ‘what the law is.’ ” NLRB v. Noel Canning , 573 U.S. 513, 525 (2014) (first quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); then quoting Marbury , 1 Cranch, at 177). The Court also gave “the most respectful consideration” to Executive Branch interpretations simply because “[t]he officers con- cerned [were] usually able men, and masters of the subject,” who were “[n]ot unfrequently . . . the draftsmen of the laws they [were] afterwards called upon to interpret.” United 9 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court States v. Moore , 95 U.S. 760, 763 (1878); see also Jacobs v. Prichard, 223 U.S. 200, 214 (1912). “Respect,” though, was just that. The views of the Exec- utive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judiciary, but did not supersede it. Whatever respect an Executive Branch interpretation was due, a judge “certainly would not be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department.” Decatur, 14 Pet., at 515; see also Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co. , 285 U.S. 1, 16 (1932). Otherwise, ju- dicial judgment would not be in dependent at all. As Justice Story put it, “in cases where [a court’s] own judgment . . . differ[ed] from that of other high functionaries,” the court was “not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.” Dickson , 15 Pet., at 162. B The New Deal ushered in a “rapid expansion of the ad- ministrative process.” United States v. Morton Salt Co. , 338 U.S. 632, 644 (1950). But as new agencies with new powers proliferated, the Court continued to adhere to the tradi-tional understanding that questio ns of law were for courts to decide, exercising independent judgment. During this period, the Court often treated agency deter- minations of fact as binding on the courts, provided that there was “evidence to support the findings.” St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States , 298 U.S. 38, 51 (1936). “When the legislature itself acts within the broad field of legislative discretion,” the Court reasoned, “its determina- tions are conclusive.” Ibid. Congress could therefore “ap- point[ ] an agent to act within that sphere of legislative au- thority” and “endow the agent with power to make findings of fact which are conclusive, provided the requirements of due process which are specia lly applicable to such an agency are met, as in according a fair hearing and acting upon evidence and not arbitrarily.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But the Court did not extend similar deference to agency 10 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court resolutions of questions of law. It instead made clear, re- peatedly, that “[t]he interpretation of the meaning of stat- utes, as applied to justiciable controversies,” was “exclu - sively a judicial function.” United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 544 (1940); see also Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko , 327 U.S. 358, 369 (1946); Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB , 321 U.S. 678, 681–682, n. 1 (1944). The Court understood, in the words of Justice Brandeis, that “[t]he supremacy of law demands that thereshall be opportunity to have so me court decide whether an erroneous rule of law was applied.” St. Joseph Stock Yards, 298 U.S., at 84 (concurring opinion). It also continued to note, as it long had, that the informed judgment of the Ex- ecutive Branch—especially in the form of an interpretation issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the stat- ute—could be entitled to “great weight.” American Truck- ing Assns. , 310 U.S., at 549. Perhaps most notably along those lines, in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. , 323 U.S. 134 (1944), the Court explained that the “interpretations and opinions” of the relevant agency,“made in pursuance of official duty” and “based upon . . . specialized experience,” “constitute[d] a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants [could] properly resort for guidance,” even on legal questions. Id., at 139–140. “The weight of such a judgment in a particular case,” the Court observed, would “depend upon the thor-oughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its rea- soning, its consistency with earlier and later pronounce- ments, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Id., at 140. On occasion, to be sure, th e Court applied deferential re- view upon concluding that a particular statute empowered an agency to decide how a broad statutory term applied to specific facts found by the agency. For example, in Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402 (1941), the Court deferred to an ad - ministrative conclusion that a coal-burning railroad that 11 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court had arrangements with several coal mines was not a coal “producer” under the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937. Con- gress had “specifically” granted the agency the authority tomake that determination. Id., at 411. The Court thus rea - soned that “[w]here, as here, a determination has been left to an administrative body, this delegation will be respected and the administrative conclusion left untouched” so long as the agency’s decision consti tuted “a sensible exercise of judgment.” Id., at 412–413. Similarly, in NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc. , 322 U.S. 111 (1944), the Court deferred to the determination of the National Labor Relations Board that newsboys were “employee[s]” within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. The Act had, in the Court’s judgment, “assigned primarily” to the Board the task of marking a “definitiv e limitation around the term ‘employee.’ ” Id. , at 130. The Court accordingly viewed its own role as “limited” to asse ssing whether the Board’s de- termination had a “ ‘warrant in the record’ and a reasonable basis in law.” Id., at 131. Such deferential review, though, was cabined to fact- bound determinations like those at issue in Gray and Hearst . Neither Gray nor Hearst purported to refashion the longstanding judicial approach to questions of law. In Gray , after deferring to the agency’s determination that a particular entity was not a “producer” of coal, the Court went on to discern, based on its own reading of the text, whether another statutory term—“other disposal” of coal— encompassed a transaction lacking a transfer of title. See 314 U.S., at 416–417. The Court evidently perceived no basis for deference to the agency with respect to that pure legal question. And in Hearst, the Court proclaimed that“[u]ndoubtedly questions of statutory interpretation . . . are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute.” 322 U.S., at 130–131. At least with 12 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court respect to questions it regarded as involving “statutory in - terpretation,” the Court thus did not disturb the traditionalrule. It merely thought that a different approach shouldapply where application of a statutory term was sufficiently intertwined with the agency’s factfinding. In any event, the Court was far from consistent in review- ing deferentially even such factbound statutory determina- tions. Often the Court simply interpreted and applied the statute before it. See K.Davis, Administrative Law §248, p. 893 (1951) (“The one statement that can be made with confidence about applicability of the doctrine of Gray v. Powell is that sometimes the Supreme Court applies it and sometimes it does not.”); B.Schwartz, Gray vs. Powell and the Scope of Review, 54 Mich. L.Rev. 1, 68 (1955) (noting an “embarrassingly large number of Supreme Court deci - sions that do not adhere to the doctrine of Gray v. Powell ”). In one illustrative example, the Court rejected the U.S. Price Administrator’s determination that a particularwarehouse was a “public utility” entitled to an exemption from the Administrator’s General Maximum Price Regula- tion. Despite the striking resemblance of that administra- tive determination to those that triggered deference in Gray and Hearst , the Court declined to “accept the Administra - tor’s view in deference to ad ministrative construction.” Da- vies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles , 321 U.S. 144, 156 (1944). The Administrator’s view, the Court explained, had “hardlyseasoned or broadened into a settled administrative prac- tice,” and thus did not “overw eigh the considerations” the Court had “set forth as to the proper construction of thestatute.” Ibid. Nothing in the New Deal era or before it thus resembled the deference rule the Court would begin applying decadeslater to all varieties of agency interpretations of statutes. Instead, just five years after Gray and two after Hearst , Congress codified the opposite rule: the traditional under- standing that courts must “decide all relevant questions of 13 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court law.” 5 U.S. C. §706.3 C Congress in 1946 enacted the APA “as a check upon ad- ministrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.” Morton Salt , 338 U.S., at 644. It was the culmi- nation of a “comprehensive rethinking of the place of ad- ministrative agencies in a re gime of separate and divided powers.” Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physi- cians , 476 U.S. 667, 670–671 (1986). In addition to prescribing procedures for agency action, the APA delineates the basic contours of judicial review ofsuch action. As relevant here, Section 706 directs that “[t]o —————— 3The dissent plucks out Gray , Hearst , and—to “gild the lily,” in its tell- ing—three more 1940s decisions, claiming they reflect the relevant his- torical tradition of judicial review. Post, at 21–22, and n. 6 (opinion of KAGAN , J.). But it has no substantial response to the fact that Gray and Hearst themselves endorsed, implicitly in one case and explicitly in the next, the traditional rule that “questio ns of statutory interpretation . . . are for the courts to resolve, givi ng appropriate weight”—not outright deference—“to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administerthe questioned statute.” Hearst , 322 U.S., at 130–131. And it fails to recognize the deep roots that this rule has in our Nati on’s judicial tradi - tion, to the limited extent it engages with that tradition at all. See post, at 20–21, n. 5. Instead, like the Government, it strains to equate the “respect” or “weight” traditionally afforded to Executive Branch interpre - tations with binding deference. See ibid. ; Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 21–24. That supposed equivalence is a fiction. The dis- sent’s cases establish that a “ contemporaneous construction” shared by “not only . . . the courts” but also “the departments” could be “control- ling,” Schell’s Executors v. Fauché , 138 U.S. 562, 572 (1891) (emphasis added), and that courts might “lean in favor” of a “contemporaneous” and “continued” construction of the Execut ive Branch as strong evidence of a statute’s meaning, United States v. Alabama Great Southern R.Co. , 142 U.S. 615, 621 (1892). They do not establish that Executive Branch in - terpretations of ambiguous statutes—no matter how in consistent, late breaking, or flawed—always bound the courts. In reality, a judge was never “bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a depart - ment.” Decatur v. Paulding , 14 Pet. 497, 515 (1840). 14 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and de- termine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.” 5 U.S. C. §706. It further requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . not in accordance with law.” §706(2)(A). The APA thus codifies for agency cases the unremarka- ble, yet elemental proposition re flected by judicial practice dating back to Marbury : that courts decide legal questions by applying their own judgment. It specifies that courts,not agencies, will decide “ all relevant questions of law” aris - ing on review of agency action, §706 (emphasis added)— even those involving ambiguous laws—and set aside any such action inconsistent with the law as they interpret it. And it prescribes no deferential standard for courts to em - ploy in answering those legal questions. That omission is telling, because Section 706 does mandate that judicial re- view of agency policymaking and factfinding be deferential. See §706(2)(A) (agency action to be set aside if “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion”); §706(2)(E) (agency factfinding in formal proceedings to be set aside if “unsup-ported by substantial evidence”). In a statute designed to “serve as the fundamental char- ter of the administrative state,” Kisor v. Wilkie , 588 U.S. 558, 580 (2019) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), Congress surely would have articulated a similarly deferential standard applicable to questions of law had it intended to depart from the settled pre-APA un - derstanding that deciding such questions was “exclusively a judicial function,” American Trucking Assns. , 310 U.S., at 544. But nothing in the APA hints at such a dramatic departure. On the contrary, by directing courts to “inter- pret constitutional and statut ory provisions” without differ- entiating between the two, Section 706 makes clear that 15 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court agency interpretations of statutes—like agency interpreta- tions of the Constitution—are not entitled to deference. Un- der the APA, it thus “remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law means what the agency says.” Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn. , 575 U.S. 92, 109 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).4 The text of the APA means what it says. And a look at its history if anything only underscores that plain meaning. According to both the House and Senate Reports on the leg- islation, Section 706 “provide[d] that questions of law are for courts rather than agencies to decide in the last analy- sis.” H.R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946) (emphasis added); accord, S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 28 (1945). Some of the legislation’s most prominent supporters articulated the same view. See 92 Cong. Rec.5654 (1946) (statement of Rep. Walter); P.McCarran, Im- proving “Administrative Justice”: Hearings and Evidence; Scope of Judicial Review, 32 A.B. A.J. 827, 831 (1946). Even the Department of Justice—an agency with every in - centive to endorse a view of the APA favorable to the Exec- utive Branch—opined after its enactment that Section 706 merely “restate[d] the present law as to the scope of judicial review.” Dept. of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the —————— 4The dissent observes that Section 706 does not say expressly that courts are to decide legal questions using “a de novo standard of review.” Post, at 16. That much is true. But statutes can be sensibly understood only “by reviewing text in context.” Pulsifer v. United States , 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024). Since the start of our Republic, courts have “decide[d] . . . questions of law” and “interpret [ed] constitutional and statutory pro- visions” by applying their own legal judgment. §706. Setting aside its misplaced reliance on Gray and Hearst , the dissent does not and could not deny that tradition. But it none theless insists that to codify that tradition, Congress needed to expre ssly reject a sort of deference the courts had never before applied—and would not apply for several dec- ades to come. It did not. “The noti on that some things ‘go without saying’ applies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.” Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014). 16 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947); see also Kisor , 588 U.S., at 582 (plurality opinion) (same). That “present law,” as we have described, adhered to the traditional con-ception of the judicial function. See supra, at 9–13. Various respected commentators contemporaneously maintained that the APA required reviewing courts to ex- ercise independent judgment on questions of law. Professor John Dickinson, for example, read the APA to “impose a clear mandate that all [questions of law] shall be decided by the reviewing Court itself, and in the exercise of its own in-dependent judgment.” Administrative Procedure Act: Scope and Grounds of Broadened Judicial Review, 33 A.B. A.J. 434, 516 (1947). Professor Bernard Schwartz noted that §706 “would seem . . . to be merely a legislative restatement of the familiar review principle that questions of law are for the reviewing court, at the same time leaving to the courts the task of determining in each case what are questions of law.” Mixed Questions of Law and Fact and the Administrative Procedure Act, 19 Ford. L.Rev. 73, 84– 85 (1950). And Professor Louis Jaffe, who had served in several agencies at the advent of the New Deal, thought that §706 leaves it up to the reviewing “court” to “decide as a ‘question of law’ whether there is ‘discretion’ in the prem- ises”—that is, whether the statute at issue delegates par- ticular discretionary authority to an agency. Judicial Con- trol of Administrative Action 570 (1965). The APA, in short, incorporates the traditional under- standing of the judicial function, under which courts mustexercise independent judgment in determining the mean- ing of statutory provisions. In exercising such judgment, though, courts may—as they have from the start—seek aid from the interpretations of those responsible for imple- menting particular statutes. Such interpretations “consti-tute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance” con- sistent with the APA.Skidmore, 323 U.S., at 140. And 17 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute at issue, and which have remained consistent over time, may be especially useful in determining the statute’s mean-ing. See ibid.; American Trucking Assns. , 310 U.S., at 549. In a case involving an agency, of course, the statute’s meaning may well be that the agency is authorized to exer- cise a degree of discretion. Congress has often enacted such statutes. For example, some statutes “expressly delegate[ ]” to an agency the authority to give meaning to a particular statutory term. Batterton v. Francis , 432 U.S. 416, 425 (1977) (emphasis deleted). 5 Others empower an agency to prescribe rules to “fill up the details” of a statutory scheme, Wayman v. Southard , 10 Wheat. 1, 43 (1825), or to regulate subject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that“leaves agencies with flexibility,” Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743, 752 (2015), such as “appropriate” or “reasona- ble.” 6 When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates —————— 5See, e.g., 29 U.S. C. §213(a)(15) (exempting from provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act “any employ ee employed on a casual basis in domestic service employment to provide companionship services for in- dividuals who (because of age or infi rmity) are unable to care for them - selves ( as such terms are defined and delimited by regulations of the Sec- retary )” (emphasis added)); 42 U.S. C. §5846(a)(2) (requiring notification to Nuclear Regulatory Commission when a facility or activity licensed or regulated pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act “contains a defect which could create a substantial safety hazard, as defined by regulations which the Commission shall promulgate” (emphasis added)). 6See, e.g., 33 U.S. C. §1312(a) (requiring establishment of effluent lim- itations “[w]henever, in the judgment of the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] Administrator . . . , di scharges of pollutants from a point source or group of point sources . . . would interfere with the attainmentor maintenance of that water quality . . . which shall assure” various out - comes, such as the “protection of public health” and “public water sup - plies”); 42 U.S. C. §7412(n)(1)(A) (directing EPA to regulate power plants “if the Administrator finds such regulation is appropriate and nec - essary”). 18 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court discretionary authority to an ag ency, the role of the review- ing court under the APA is, as always, to independently in- terpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress sub - ject to constitutional limits. The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional dele gations, “fix[ing] the bound - aries of [the] delegated authority,” H.Monaghan, Marbury and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L.Rev. 1, 27 (1983), and ensuring the agency has engaged in “ ‘reasoned decisionmaking’ ” within those boundaries, Michigan , 576 U.S., at 750 (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & Service, Inc. v. NLRB , 522 U.S. 359, 374 (1998)); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto- mobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). By doing so, a court upholds the traditional concepti on of the judicial function that the APA adopts. III The deference that Chevron requires of courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.A In the decades between the enactment of the APA and this Court’s decision in Chevron , courts generally continued to review agency interpretations of the statutes they admin-ister by independently examining each statute to determine its meaning. Cf. T.Merrill, Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.J. 969, 972–975 (1992). As an early proponent (and later critic) of Chevron recounted, courts during this period thus identi fied delegations of discretion- ary authority to agencies on a “statute-by-statute basis.” A.Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpreta-tions of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 516. Chevron , decided in 1984 by a bare quorum of six Jus- tices, triggered a marked departure from the traditional ap- proach. The question in the case was whether an EPA reg- ulation “allow[ing] States to treat all of the pollution- 19 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court emitting devices within the same industrial grouping as though they were encased within a single ‘bubble’ ” was con- sistent with the term “stationary source” as used in the Clean Air Act. 467 U.S., at 840. To answer that question of statutory interpretation, the Court articulated and em-ployed a now familiar two-step approach broadly applicable to review of agency action. The first step was to discern “whether Congress ha[d] di - rectly spoken to the precise question at issue.” Id., at 842. The Court explained that “[i]f the intent of Congress isclear, that is the end of the matter,” ibid., and courts were therefore to “reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent,” id., at 843, n. 9. To discern such intent, the Court noted, a reviewing court was to “employ[ ] traditional tools of statutory construction.” Ibid. Without mentioning the APA, or acknowledging any doc- trinal shift, the Court articulated a second step applicable when “Congress ha[d] not directly addressed the precise question at issue.” Id., at 843. In such a case—that is, a case in which “the statute [was] silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand —a reviewing court could not “simply impose its own construction on the stat-ute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administra- tive interpretation.” Ibid. (footnote omitted). A court in - stead had to set aside the traditional interpretive tools anddefer to the agency if it had offered “a permissible construc-tion of the statute,” ibid., even if not “the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in ajudicial proceeding,” ibid., n. 11. That directive was justi- fied, according to the Court, by the understanding that ad - ministering statutes “requires the formulation of policy” tofill statutory “gap[s]”; by the long judicial tradition of ac - cording “considerable weight” to Executive Branch inter-pretations; and by a host of other considerations, including the complexity of the regulatory scheme, EPA’s “detailed 20 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court and reasoned” consideration, the policy-laden nature of the judgment supposedly required, and the agency’s indirect ac- countability to the people through the President. Id., at 843, 844, and n. 14, 865. Employing this new test, th e Court concluded that Con- gress had not addressed the question at issue with the nec-essary “level of specificity” and that EPA’s interpretation was “entitled to deference.” Id., at 865. It did not matter why Congress, as the Court saw it, had not squarely ad- dressed the question, see ibid., or that “the agency ha[d] from time to time changed its interpretation,” id., at 863. The latest EPA interpretation was a permissible reading of the Clean Air Act, so under the Court’s new rule, that read - ing controlled. Initially, Chevron “seemed destined to obscurity.” T.Merrill, The Story of Chevron : The Making of an Accidental Landmark, 66 Admin. L.Rev. 253, 276 (2014). The Court did not at first treat it as the watershed decision it was fated to become; it was hardly cited in cases involving stat - utory questions of agency authority. See ibid. But within a few years, both this Court and the courts of appeals were routinely invoking its two-step framework as the governing standard in such cases. See id., at 276–277. As the Court did so, it revisited the doctrine’s justifications. Eventually, the Court decided that Chevron rested on “a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambigu- ity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess what-ever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.” Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. , 517 U.S. 735, 740–741 (1996); see also, e.g., Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U.S. 261, 276–277 (2016); Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA , 573 U.S. 302, 315 (2014); National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services , 545 U.S. 967, 982 (2005). 21 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court B Neither Chevron nor any subsequent decision of this Court attempted to reconcile it s framework with the APA.The “law of deference” that this Court has built on the foun- dation laid in Chevron has instead been “[h]eedless of the original design” of the APA.Perez , 575 U.S., at 109 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). 1 Chevron defies the command of the APA that “the review- ing court”—not the agency whose action it reviews—is to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (e mphasis added). It requires a court to ignore, not follow, “the reading the court would have reached” had it exercised its independent judgment as required by the APA.Chevron , 467 U.S., at 843, n. 11. And although exercising independent judgment is consistent with the “respect” historically given to Executive Branch in - terpretations, see, e.g., Edwards’ Lessee , 12 Wheat., at 210; Skidmore, 323 U.S., at 140, Chevron insists on much more. It demands that courts mechanically afford binding defer- ence to agency interpretations, including those that have been inconsistent over time. See 467 U.S., at 863. Still worse, it forces courts to do so even when a pre-existing ju- dicial precedent holds that the statute means something else—unless the prior court happened to also say that the statute is “unambiguous.” Brand X, 545 U.S., at 982. That regime is the antithesis of the time honored approach the APA prescribes. In fretting over the prospect of “allow[ing]” a judicial interpretation of a statute “to override an agency’s” in a dispute before a court, ibid., Chevron turns the statutory scheme for judicial review of agency action up - side down. Chevron cannot be reconciled with the APA, as the Gov- ernment and the dissent contend, by presuming that statu - tory ambiguities are implicit delegations to agencies. See 22 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 13, 37–38; post, at 4–15 (opinion of K AGAN , J.). Presumptions have their place in statutory interpretation, but only to the extent that they approximate reality. Chevron ’s presumption does not, because “[a]n ambiguity is simply not a delegation of law-interpreting power. Chevron confuses the two.” C.Sun- stein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State, 103Harv. L.Rev. 405, 445 (1989). As Chevron itself noted, am- biguities may result from an inability on the part of Con-gress to squarely answer the question at hand, or from a failure to even “consider the question” with the requisite precision. 467 U.S., at 865. In neither case does an ambi- guity necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting inter- pretive question. And many or perhaps most statutory am - biguities may be unintentional. As the Framers recognized,ambiguities will inevitably follow from “the complexity of objects, . . . the imperfection of the human faculties,” and the simple fact that “no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea.” The Federalist No. 37, at 236. Courts, after all, routinely confront statutory ambiguities in cases having nothing to do with Chevron —cases that do not involve agency interpretati ons or delegations of author- ity. Of course, when faced with a statutory ambiguity insuch a case, the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody, and a court is not somehow relieved of its obligation to in- dependently interpret the statute. Courts in that situation do not throw up their hands because “Congress’s instruc- tions have” supposedly “run out,” leaving a statutory “gap.” Post, at 2 (opinion of K AGAN , J.). Courts instead under- stand that such statutes, no matter how impenetrable, do—in fact, must—have a single, best meaning. That is the whole point of having written statutes; “every statute’s meaning is fixed at the time of enactment.” Wisconsin Cen - 23 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court tral Ltd. v. United States , 585 U.S. 274, 284 (2018) (empha- sis deleted). So instead of declaring a particular party’s reading “permissible” in such a case, courts use every tool at their disposal to determine the best reading of the stat- ute and resolve the ambiguity. In an agency case as in any other, though, even if some judges might (or might not) consider the statute ambiguous, there is a best reading all the same—“the reading the courtwould have reached” if no agency were involved. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 843, n. 11. It therefore makes no sense to speak of a “permissible” interpretation that is not the one the court, after applying all relevant interpretive tools, con- cludes is best. In the business of statutory interpretation,if it is not the best, it is not permissible. Perhaps most fundamentally, Chevron ’s presumption is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do. The Framers, as noted, anticipated that courts would often confront stat- utory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment. And even Chevron itself reaffirmed that “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction” and recog-nized that “in the absence of an administrative interpreta- tion,” it is “necessary” for a court to “impose its own con - struction on the statute.” Id., at 843, and n. 9. Chevron gravely erred, though, in concluding that the inquiry is fun-damentally different just because an administrative inter- pretation is in play. The very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction—the tools courts use every day—is to resolve statutory ambigu ities. That is no less true when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency’s own power—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is least appropriate. 2 The Government responds that Congress must generally 24 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court intend for agencies to resolve statutory ambiguities because agencies have subject matter expertise regarding the stat- utes they administer; because deferring to agencies pur-portedly promotes the uniform construction of federal law; and because resolving statutory ambiguities can involve policymaking best left to politic al actors, rather than courts. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 16–19. The dissent offers more of the same. See post, at 9–14. But none of these considerations justifies Chevron ’s sweeping pre- sumption of congressional intent. Beginning with expertise, we recently noted that inter - pretive issues arising in connection with a regulatoryscheme often “may fall more naturally into a judge’s baili-wick” than an agency’s. Kisor , 588 U.S., at 578 (opinion of the Court). We thus observed that “[w]hen the agency hasno comparative expertise in re solving a regulatory ambigu - ity, Congress presumably would not grant it that author - ity.” Ibid. Chevron ’s broad rule of deference, though, de- mands that courts presume just the opposite. Under that rule, ambiguities of all stripes trigger deference. Indeed, the Government and, seemingly, the dissent continue to de - fend the proposition that Chevron applies even in cases hav- ing little to do with an agency’s technical subject matter ex - pertise. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, p. 17; post, at 10. But even when an ambiguity happens to implicate a tech- nical matter, it does not follo w that Congress has taken the power to authoritatively interpret the statute from the courts and given it to the ag ency. Congress expects courts to handle technical statutory questions. “[M]any statutory cases” call upon “courts [to] interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law,” Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U.S. 141, 161 (2001) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and courts did so without i ssue in agency cases before Chev- ron, see post , at 30 (G ORSUCH , J., concurring). Courts, after all, do not decide such questions blindly. The parties and 25 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court amici in such cases are steeped in the subject matter, and reviewing courts have the benefi t of their perspectives. In an agency case in particular, the court will go about its task with the agency’s “body of experience and informed judg- ment,” among other information, at its disposal. Skidmore , 323 U.S., at 140. And although an agency’s interpretationof a statute “cannot bind a court,” it may be especially in- formative “to the extent it rests on factual premises within[the agency’s] expertise.” Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, 464 U.S. 89, 98, n. 8 (1983). Such ex- pertise has always been one of the factors which may give an Executive Branch interpretation particular “power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” Skidmore, 323 U.S., at 140; see, e.g., County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund , 590 U.S. 165, 180 (2020); Moore , 95 U.S., at 763. For those reasons, delegating ultimate interpretive au- thority to agencies is simply not necessary to ensure that the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well informed by subject matter expertise. The better presumption is there- fore that Congress expects courts to do their ordinary job of interpreting statutes, with due respect for the views of the Executive Branch. And to the extent that Congress and the Executive Branch may disagree with how the courts have performed that job in a particu lar case, they are of course always free to act by revising the statute. Nor does a desire for the uni form construction of federal law justify Chevron . Given inconsistencies in how judges apply Chevron , see infra , at 30–33, it is unclear how much the doctrine as a whole (as opposed to its highly deferential second step) actually promotes such uniformity. In any event, there is little value in imposing a uniform interpre - tation of a statute if that interpretation is wrong. We see no reason to presume that Congress prefers uniformity for uniformity’s sake over the corre ct interpretation of the laws it enacts. 26 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court The view that interpretation of ambiguous statutory pro- visions amounts to policymaking suited for political actors rather than courts is especially mistaken, for it rests on a profound misconception of the judicial role. It is reasonable to assume that Congress intends to leave policymaking to political actors. But resolution of statutory ambiguities in- volves legal interpretation. That task does not suddenly be- come policymaking just because a court has an “agency tofall back on.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 575 (opinion of the Court). Courts interpret statutes, no matter the context, based onthe traditional tools of statutory construction, not individ- ual policy preferences. Indeed, the Framers crafted the Constitution to ensure that federal judges could exercise judgment free from the influence of the political branches. See The Federalist, No. 78, at 522–525. They were to con- strue the law with “[c]lear heads . . . and honest hearts,” not with an eye to policy preferences that had not made it into the statute. 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J.Andrews ed. 1896). That is not to say that Congress cannot or does not confer discretionary authority on agencies. Congress may do so, subject to constitutional limits, and it often has. But to stay out of discretionary policymaking left to the politicalbranches, judges need only fulfill their obligations under the APA to independently identi fy and respect such delega- tions of authority, police the outer statutory boundaries of those delegations, and ensure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the AP A.By forcing courts to in - stead pretend that ambiguities are necessarily delegations, Chevron does not prevent judges from making policy. It prevents them from judging. 3 In truth, Chevron ’s justifying presumption is, as Mem- bers of this Court have often recognized, a fiction. See Buff- ington v. McDonough, 598 U.S. ___, ___ (2022) (G ORSUCH , 27 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 11); Cuozzo , 579 U.S., at 286 (T HOMAS , J., concurring); Scalia, 1989 Duke L.J., at 517; see also post, at 15 (opinion of KAGAN , J.). So we have spent the better part of four decades imposing one limitation on Chevron after another, pruning its presumption on the understanding that “where it is in doubt that Congress actually in tended to delegate particu- lar interpretive authority to an agency, Chevron is ‘inappli- cable.’ ” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 230 (2001) (quoting Christensen v. Harris County , 529 U.S. 576, 597 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see also Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett , 494 U.S. 638, 649 (1990). Consider the many refinements we have made in an ef- fort to match Chevron ’s presumption to reality. We have said that Chevron applies only “when it appears that Con-gress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency inter- pretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exer- cise of that authority.” Mead , 533 U.S., at 226–227. In practice, that threshold requirement—sometimes called Chevron “step zero”—largely limits Chevron to “the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.” 533 U.S., at 230. But even when those processes are used, deference is still not warranted “where the regulation is ‘procedurally defective’—that is, where the agency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regu-lation.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro , 579 U.S. 211, 220 (2016) (quoting Mead , 533 U.S., at 227). Even where those procedural hurdles are cleared, sub- stantive ones remain. Most notably, Chevron does not ap- ply if the question at issue is one of “deep ‘economic and political significance.’ ” King v. Burwell , 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015). We have instead expected Congress to delegatesuch authority “expressly” if at all, ibid., for “[e]xtraordi- nary grants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished through ‘modest words,’ ‘vague terms,’ or ‘subtle device[s],’ ” 28 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697, 723 (2022) (quoting Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc. , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001); alteration in original). Nor have we applied Chevron to agency interpretations of judicial review provi - sions, see Adams Fruit Co. , 494 U.S., at 649–650, or to stat - utory schemes not administered by the agency seeking def- erence, see Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497, 519– 520 (2018). And we have sent mixed signals on whether Chevron applies when a statute has criminal applications. Compare Abramski v. United States , 573 U.S. 169, 191 (2014), with Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore. , 515 U.S. 687, 704, n. 18 (1995). Confronted with this byzantine set of preconditions and exceptions, some courts have simply bypassed Chevron , saying it makes no difference for one reason or another. 7 And even when they do invoke Chevron , courts do not al - ways heed the various steps and nuances of that evolving doctrine. In one of the cases before us today, for example, the First Circuit both skipped “step zero,” see 62 F. 4th, at 628, and refused to “classify [its] conclusion as a product of Chevron step one or step two”—though it ultimately ap- pears to have deferred under step two, id., at 634. —————— 7See, e.g., Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo- sives , 45 F. 306, 313–314 (CADC 2022), abrogated by Garland v. Car- gill, 602 U.S. ___ (2024); County of Amador v.

See Cuozzo , 579 U.S., at 280 (most recent occasion). But Chevron remains on the books. So litigants must continue to wrestle with it, and lower courts—bound by even our crumbling prece-dents, see Agostini v. Felton , 521 U.S. 203, 238 (1997)— understandably continue to apply it. The experience of the last 40 years has thus done little to rehabilitate Chevron . It has only made clear that Chevron ’s fictional presumption of cong ressional intent was always unmoored from the APA’s demand that courts exercise in - dependent judgment in construing statutes administered by agencies. At best, our intricate Chevron doctrine has been nothing more than a distraction from the questionthat matters: Does the statute authorize the challenged agency action? And at worst, it has required courts to vio- late the APA by yielding to an agency the express responsi-bility, vested in “the reviewing court ,” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706 (emphasis added). IV The only question left is whether stare decisis , the doc- trine governing judicial adherence to precedent, requires us to persist in the Chevron project. It does not. Stare decisis is not an “inexorable command,” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828 (1991), and the stare decisis considerations most relevant here—“the quality of [the precedent’s] rea- soning, the workability of the rule it established, . . . and reliance on the decision,” Knick v. Township of Scott , 588 U.S. 180, 203 (2019) (quoting Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees , 585 U.S. 878, 917 (2018))—all weigh in favor of letting Chevron go. Chevron has proved to be fundamentally misguided. De - spite reshaping judicial review of agency action, neither it nor any case of ours applying it grappled with the APA— 30 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court the statute that lays out how such review works. Its flaws were nonetheless apparent from the start, prompting this Court to revise its foundations and continually limit its ap- plication. It has launched and sustained a cottage industry of scholars attempting to de cipher its basis and meaning. And Members of this Court have long questioned its prem-ises. See, e.g., Pereira v. Sessions , 585 U.S. 198, 219–221 (2018) (Kennedy, J., concurring); Michigan , 576 U.S., at 760–764 (T HOMAS , J., concurring); Buffington , 598 U.S. ___ (opinion of G ORSUCH , J.); B.Kavanaugh, Fixing Statu - tory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L.Rev. 2118, 2150–2154(2016). Even Justice Scalia, an early champion of Chevron , came to seriously doubt whether it could be reconciled with the APA.See Perez , 575 U.S., at 109–110 (opinion concur- ring in judgment). For its entire existence, Chevron has been a “rule in search of a justification,” Knick, 588 U.S., at 204, if it was ever coherent enough to be called a rule at all. Experience has also shown that Chevron is unworkable. The defining feature of its framework is the identification of statutory ambiguity, which requires deference at the doc- trine’s second step. But the concept of ambiguity has al - ways evaded meaningful definiti on. As Justice Scalia put the dilemma just five years after Chevron was decided: “How clear is clear?” 1989 Duke L.J., at 521. We are no closer to an answer to that question than we were four decades ago. “ ‘[A]mbiguity’ is a term that may have different meanings for different judges.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc. , 545 U.S. 546, 572 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting). One judge might see ambiguityeverywhere; another might neve r encounter it. Compare L.Silberman, Chevron—The Intersection of Law & Policy, 58 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 821, 822 (1990), with R.Kethledge, Am- biguities and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the Bench, 70 Vand. L.Rev. En Banc 315, 323 (2017). A rule of law that is so wholly “in the eye of the 31 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court beholder,” Exxon Mobil Corp., 545 U.S., at 572 (Stevens, J., dissenting), invites different results in like cases and is therefore “arbitrary in practice,” Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp. , 485 U.S. 271, 283 (1988). Such an impressionistic and malleable concept “cannot stand as an every-day test for allocating” interpretive authority be- tween courts and agencies. Swift & Co. v. Wickham , 382 U.S. 111, 125 (1965). The dissent proves the point. It tells us that a court should reach Chevron ’s second step when it finds, “at the end of its interpretive work,” that “Congress has left an am- biguity or gap.” Post, at 1–2. (The Government offers a similar test. See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 7, 10, 14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 113–114, 116.) That is no guide at all. Once more, the basic nature and meaning of a statute does not change when an agency happens to be in- volved. Nor does it change just because the agency has hap-pened to offer its interpretation through the sort of proce- dures necessary to obtain deference, or because the other preconditions for Chevron happen to be satisfied. The stat - ute still has a best meaning, necessarily discernible by a court deploying its full interpre tive toolkit. So for the dis- sent’s test to have any meaning, it must think that in an agency case (unlike in any other), a court should give up on its “interpretive work” before it has identified that best meaning. But how does a court know when to do so? On that point, the dissent leaves a gap of its own. It protests only that some other interpretive tools—all with pedigrees more robust than Chevron ’s, and all designed to help courts identify the meaning of a text rather than allow the Execu-tive Branch to displace it—also apply to ambiguous texts. See post, at 27. That this is all the dissent can come up with, after four decades of judicial experience attempting toidentify ambiguity under Chevron , reveals the futility of the 32 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court exercise.8 Because Chevron in its original, two-step form was so in- determinate and sweeping, we have instead been forced to clarify the doctrine again and again. Our attempts to do so have only added to Chevron’s unworkability, transforming the original two-step into a dizzying breakdance. See Ad- ams Fruit Co. , 494 U.S., at 649–650; Mead , 533 U.S., at 226–227; King , 576 U.S., at 486; Encino Motorcars , 579 U.S., at 220; Epic Systems , 584 U.S., at 519–520; on and on. And the doctrine continues to spawn difficult threshold questions that promise to further complicate the inquiry should Chevron be retained. See, e .g., Cargill v. Garland , 57 F. 447, 465–468 (CA5 2023) (plurality opinion) (May the Government waive reliance on Chevron ? Does Chevron apply to agency interpretations of statutes imposing crimi- nal penalties? Does Chevron displace the rule of lenity?), aff ’d, 602 U.S. ___ (2024). Four decades after its inception, Chevron has thus be- come an impediment, rather than an aid, to accomplishing the basic judicial task of “say[ing] what the law is.” Mar- bury , 1 Cranch, at 177. And its continuing import is far from clear. Courts have often declined to engage with the doctrine, saying it makes no difference. See n. 7, supra. And as noted, we have avoided deferring under Chevron since 2016. That trend is nothing new; for decades, we have often declined to invoke Chevron even in those cases where it might appear to be applicable. See W.Eskridge & L.Baer, The Continuum of Deference: Supreme Court Treat- ment of Agency Statutory Interpretations From Chevron to Hamdan , 96 Geo. L.J. 1083, 1125 (2008). At this point, all —————— 8Citing an empirical study, the dissent adds that Chevron “fosters agreement among judges.” Post, at 28. I t is hardly su rprising that a study might find as much; Chevron ’s second step is supposed to be hos - pitable to agency interpretations. So when judges get there, they tend to agree that the agency wins. That proves nothing about the supposed ease or predictability of identify ing ambiguity in the first place. 33 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court that remains of Chevron is a decaying husk with bold pre- tensions. Nor has Chevron been the sort of “ ‘stable background ’ rule” that fosters meaningful reliance. Post, at 8, n. 1 (opin - ion of K AGAN , J.) (quoting Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. , 561 U.S. 247, 261 (2010)). Given our constant tinkering with and eventual turn away from Chevron , and its inconsistent application by the lower courts, it instead is hard to see how anyone—Congress included—could reason- ably expect a court to rely on Chevron in any particular case. And even if it were possible to predict accuratelywhen courts will apply Chevron , the doctrine “does not pro- vide ‘a clear or easily applicable standard, so arguments forreliance based on its clarity are misplaced.’ ” Janus , 585 U.S., at 927 (quoting South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 585 U.S. 162, 186 (2018)). To plan on Chevron yielding a par- ticular result is to gamble not only that the doctrine will be invoked, but also that it w ill produce readily foreseeable outcomes and the stability that comes with them. Historyhas proved neither bet to be a winning proposition. Rather than safeguarding reliance interests, Chevron af- firmatively destroys them. Under Chevron , a statutory am - biguity, no matter why it is there, becomes a license author - izing an agency to change positions as much as it likes, with “[u]nexplained inconsistency” being “at most . . . a reason for holding an interpretation to be . . . arbitrary and capri- cious.” Brand X , 545 U.S., at 981. But statutory ambigu- ity, as we have explained, is not a reliable indicator of ac- tual delegation of discretio nary authority to agencies. Chevron thus allows agencies to change course even when Congress has given them no power to do so. By its sheer breadth, Chevron fosters unwarranted instability in the law, leaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty. Chevron accordingly has undermined the very “rule oflaw” values that stare decisis exists to secure. Michigan v. 34 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO Opinion of the Court Bay Mills Indian Community , 572 U.S. 782, 798 (2014). And it cannot be constrained by admonishing courts to be extra careful, or by tacking on a new batch of conditions. We would need to once again “revis[e] its theoretical basis . . . in order to cure its practical deficiencies.” Montejo v. Louisiana , 556 U.S. 778, 792 (2009). Stare decisis does not require us to do so, especia lly because any refinements we might make would only point co urts back to their duties un- der the APA to “decide all rele vant questions of law” and “interpret . . . statutory provisions.” §706. Nor is there any reason to wait helplessly fo r Congress to correct our mis- take. The Court has jettisoned many precedents that Con-gress likewise could have legislatively overruled. See, e.g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union , 485 U.S. 617, 618 (1988) (per curiam ) (collecting cases). And part of “judicial humility,” post, at 3, 25 (opinion of K AGAN , J.,), is admitting and in certain cases correcting our own mistakes, especiallywhen those mistakes are serious, see post, at 8–9 (opinion of G ORSUCH , J.). This is one of those cases. Chevron was a judicial inven- tion that required judges to disregard their statutory du-ties. And the only way to “ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion,” Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U.S. 254, 265 (1986), is for us to leave Chevron behind. By doing so, however, we do not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework. The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful—in-cluding the Clean Air Act holding of Chevron itself—are still subject to statutory stare decisis despite our change in interpretive methodology. See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Hum - phries , 553 U.S. 442, 457 (2008). Mere reliance on Chevron cannot constitute a “‘special justification’” for overruling such a holding, because to say a precedent relied on Chev- ron is, at best, “just an argument that the precedent was wrongly decided.” Halliburton Co. v. Erica P.John Fund, 35 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) Opinion of the Court Inc., 573 U.S. 258, 266 (2014) (quoting Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000)). That is not enough to justify overruling a statutory precedent. * * * The dissent ends by quoting Chevron: “ ‘Judges are not experts in the field.’ ” Post , at 31 (quoting 467 U.S., at 865). That depends, of course, on what the “field” is. If it is legal interpretation, that has been, “emphatically,” “the province and duty of the judicial department” for at least 221 years. Marbury , 1 Cranch, at 177. The rest of the dissent’s se- lected epigraph is that judges “ ‘are not part of either politi- cal branch.’ ” Post , at 31 (quoting Chevron , 467 U.S., at 865). Indeed. Judges have always been expected to apply their “judgment” independent of the political branches when interpreting the laws those branches enact. The Fed - eralist No. 78, at 523. And one of those laws, the APA, bars judges from disregarding that responsibility just because an Executive Branch agency vi ews a statute differently. Chevron is overruled. Courts must exercise their inde- pendent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires. Careful attention to the judgment of the Executive Branch may help inform that inquiry. And when a particular statute dele- gates authority to an agency co nsistent with constitutional limits, courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts within it. But courts need not and un- der the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous. Because the D.C. and First Circuits relied on Chevron in deciding whether to uphold the Rule, their judgments arevacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceed- ings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. _________________ _________________ 1 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) THOMAS , J., concurring SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos. 22–451 and 22–1219 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES, ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–451 v.

I join the Court’s opinion in full because it correctly con - cludes that Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources De- fense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984), must finally be overruled. Under Chevron , a judge was required to adopt an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute, so long as the agency had a “permissible construction of the stat- ute.” See id. , at 843. As the Court explains, that deference does not comport with the Administrative Procedure Act,which requires judges to decide “all relevant questions of law” and “interpret constitutional and statutory provisions” when reviewing an agency action. 5 U.S. C. §706; see also ante, at 18–23; Baldwin v.

RAIMONDO THOMAS , J., concurring I write separately to underscore a more fundamental problem: Chevron deference also violates our Constitution’s separation of powers, as I have previously explained at length. See Baldwin , 589 U.S., at ___–___ (dissenting opin- ion) (slip op., at 2–4); Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743, 761– 763 (2015) (concurring opinion); see also Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. 92, 115–118 (2015) (opinion con-curring in judgment). And , I agree with J USTICE GORSUCH that we should not overlook Chevron’s constitutional de- fects in overruling it.* Post, at 15–20 (concurring opinion). To provide “practical and real protections for individual lib- erty,” the Framers drafted a Constitution that divides the legislative, executive, and judicial powers between threebranches of Government. Perez , 575 U.S., at 118 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.). Chevron deference compromises this sepa- ration of powers in two ways. It curbs the judicial powerafforded to courts, and simultaneously expands agencies’ executive power beyond constitutional limits. Chevron compels judges to abdicate their Article III “ju- dicial Power.” §1. “[T]he ju dicial power, as originally un- derstood, requires a court to exercise its independent judg - ment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.” Perez , 575 U.S., at 119 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.); accord, post, at 17–18 (opinion of G ORSUCH , J.). The Framers under- stood that “legal texts . . . often contain ambiguities,” and that the judicial power included “the power to resolve these ambiguities over time.” Perez , 575 U.S., at 119 (opinion of THOMAS , J.); accord, ante, at 7–9. But, under Chevron , a judge must accept an agency’s interpretation of an ambigu- ous law, even if he thinks another interpretation is correct. Ante , at 19. Chevron deference thus prevents judges from —————— *There is much to be commended in J USTICE GORSUCH ’s careful consid- eration from first principles of the we ight we should afford to our prece - dent.

By tying a judge’s hands, Chevron prevents the Judiciary from serving as a constitutional check on theExecutive. It allows “the Executive . . . to dictate the out- come of cases through erroneous interpretations.” Bald- win, 589 U.S., at ___ (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (slip op., at 4); Michigan , 576 U.S., at 763, n. 1 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.); see also Perez , 575 U.S., at 124 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.). Be- cause the judicial power requires judges to exercise their independent judgment, the deference that Chevron re- quires contravenes Article III’s mandate. Chevron deference also permits the Executive Branch to exercise powers not given to it. “When the Government is called upon to perform a functi on that requires an exercise of legislative, executive, or ju dicial power, only the vested recipient of that power can perform it.” Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads , 575 U.S. 43, 68 (2015) (T HOMAS , J., concurring in judgment). Because the Constitution gives the Executive Branch only “[t]he executive Power,” exec utive agencies may constitu- tionally exercise only that power. Art. II, §1, cl. 1. But, Chevron gives agencies license to exercise judicial power. By allowing agencies to defini tively interpret laws so long as they are ambiguous, Chevron “transfer[s]” the Judici- ary’s “interpretive judgment to the agency.” Perez , 575 U.S., at 124 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.); see also Baldwin , 589 U.S., at ___ (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (slip op., at 4); Michi- gan, 576 U.S., at 761–762 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.); post, at 18 (G ORSUCH , J., concurring). Chevron deference “cannot be salvaged” by recasting it as deference to an agency’s “formulation of policy.” Baldwin , 589 U.S., at ___ (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (internal quotation marks omitted) (slip op., at 3). If that were true, Chevron 4 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO THOMAS , J., concurring would mean that “agencies are unconstitutionally exercis- ing ‘legislative Powers’ vested in Congress.” Baldwin , 589 U.S., at ___ (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Art. I, §1). By “giv[ing] the force of law to agency pro-nouncements on matters of private conduct as to which Congress did not actually have an intent,” Chevron “per - mit[s] a body other than Congress to perform a functionthat requires an exercise of legislative power.” Michigan , 576 U.S., at 762 (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). No matte r the gloss put on it, Chevron ex- pands agencies’ power beyond the bounds of Article II by permitting them to exercise powers reserved to another branch of Government. Chevron deference was “not a harmless transfer of power.” Baldwin , 589 U.S., at ___ (opinion of T HOMAS , J.) (slip op., at 3). “The Constitution carefully imposes struc - tural constraints on all three branches, and the exercise of power free of those accompanying restraints subverts the design of the Constitution’s ratifiers.” Ibid. In particular, the Founders envisioned that “the courts [would] check the Executive by applying the correct interpretation of the law.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Chevron was thus a fundamental disruption of our separation of powers. It improperly strips courts of judicial power by simultaneously increasing the power of executive agencies. By overruling Chevron, we re- store this aspect of our separation of powers. To safeguard individual liberty, “[s]tructure is everything.” A.Scalia, Foreword: The Importance of S tructure in Constitutional Interpretation, 83 Notre Dame L.Rev. 1417, 1418 (2008). Although the Court finally ends our 40-year misadventure with Chevron deference, its more profound problems should not be overlooked. Regardless of what a statute says, the type of deference required by Chevron violates the Consti- tution. _________________ _________________ 1 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos. 22–451 and 22–1219 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES, ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–451 v. GINA RAIMONDO, SECRETARY OF COMMERCE, ET AL . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT RELENTLESS, INC., ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–1219 v. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, ET AL . ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT [June 28, 2024] JUSTICE GORSUCH , concurring. In disputes between individuals and the government about the meaning of a federal law, federal courts have tra - ditionally sought to offer independent judgments about “what the law is” without favor to either side. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Beginning in the mid- 1980s, however, this Court experimented with a radically different approach. Applying Chevron deference, judges be- gan deferring to the views of executive agency officials about the meaning of federal statutes. See Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984). With time, the error of this approach became widely appreciated. So much so that this Court has refused to apply Chevron deference since 2016. Today, the Court places a tombstone on Chevron no one can miss. In doing 2 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring so, the Court returns judges to interpretive rules that have guided federal courts since the Nation’s founding. I write separately to address why the proper application of the doc-trine of stare decisis supports that course. I A Today, the phrase “common law judge” may call to mind a judicial titan of the past who brilliantly devised new legal rules on his own. The phrase “ stare decisis ” might conjure up a sense that judges who come later in time are strictlybound to follow the work of th eir predecessors. But neither of those intuitions fairly describes the traditional common-law understanding of the judge’s role or the doctrine of stare decisis. At common law, a judge’s charge to decide cases was not usually understood as a license to make new law. For much of England’s early history, diffe rent rulers and different le- gal systems prevailed in different regions. As England con-solidated into a single kingdom governed by a single legal system, the judge’s task was to examine those pre-existing legal traditions and apply in the disputes that came to him those legal rules that were “common to the whole land and to all Englishmen.” F.Maitland, Equity, Also the Forms of Action at Common Law 2 (1929). That was “common law” judging. This view of the judge’s role had consequences for the au- thority due judicial decisions. Because a judge’s job was tofind and apply the law, not make it, the “opinion of the judge” and “the law” were not considered “one and the same thing.” 1 W.Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 71 (1765) (Blackstone) (emphasis deleted). A judge’s decision might bind the parties to the case at hand. M.Hale, The History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 68 (1713) (Hale). But none of that meant the judgehad the power to “make a Law properly so called” for society 3 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring at large, “for that only the King and Parliament can do.” Ibid. Other consequences followe d for the role precedent played in future judicial proceedings. Because past deci- sions represented something “less than a Law,” they did not bind future judges. Ibid. At the same time, as Matthew Hale put it, a future judge could give a past decision “Weight” as “Evidence” of the law. Ibid. Expressing the same idea, William Blackstone conceived of judicial prece- dents as “evidence” of “the common law.” 1 Blackstone 69, 71. And much like other forms of evidence, precedents at common law were thought to vary in the weight due them.Some past decisions might supply future courts with con-siderable guidance. But others might be entitled to lesser weight, not least because judges are no less prone to error than anyone else and they may sometimes “mistake” what the law demands. Id., at 71 (emphasis deleted). In cases like that, both men thought, a future judge should not rotely repeat a past mistake but instead “vindicate” the law “from misrepresentation.” Id., at 70 . When examining past decisions as evidence of the law, common law judges did not, broadly speaking, afford over-whelming weight to any “single precedent.” J.Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 209–210 (5th ed. 2019). Instead, a prior decision’s persuasive force depended in large measure on its “Consonancy and Congruity with Resolutions and Decisions of former Times.” Hale 68. An individual decision might reflect the views of one court at one moment in time, but a cons istent line of decisions rep- resenting the wisdom of many minds across many genera- tions was generally considered stronger evidence of the law’s meaning. Ibid. With this conception of precedent in mind, Lord Mans- field cautioned against elevating “particular cases” above the “general principles” that “run through the cases, and govern the decision of them.” Rust v. Cooper, 2 Cowp. 629, 4 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring 632, 98 Eng. Rep. 1277, 1279 (K.B. 1777). By discarding aberrational rulings and pursuing instead the mainstream of past decisions, he observed, the common law tended over time to “wor[k] itself pure.” Omychund v. Barker, 1 Atk. 22, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 23 (Ch. 1744) (emphasis deleted). Re-flecting similar thinking, Edmund Burke offered five prin - ciples for the evaluation of past judicial decisions: “Theyought to be shewn; first, to be numerous and not scattered here and there;—secondly, co ncurrent and not contradic- tory and mutually destructive;—th irdly, to be made in good and constitutional times;—fourth ly, not to be made to serve an occasion;—and fifthly, to be agreeable to the generaltenor of legal principles.” Speech of Dec. 23, 1790, in 3 The Speeches of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke 513 (1816). Not only did different decisions carry different weight, so did different language within a decision. An opinion’s hold - ing and the reasoning essential to it (the ratio decidendi ) merited careful attention. Dicta, stray remarks, and di - gressions warranted less weight. See N.Duxbury, The In- tricacies of Dicta and Dissent 19–24 (2021) (Duxbury). These were no more than “the vapours and fumes of law.” F.Bacon, The Lord Keeper’s Speech in the Exchequer(1617), in 2 The Works of Francis Bacon 478 (B.Montagu ed. 1887) (Bacon). That is not to say those “vapours” were worthless. Often dicta might provide the parties to a particular dispute a “fuller understanding of the court’s decisional path or re - lated areas of concern.” B.Garner et al., The Law of Judi- cial Precedent 65 (2016) (Precedent). Dicta might also pro- vide future courts with a sou rce of “thoughtful advice.” Ibid. But future courts had to be careful not to treat every“hasty expression . . . as a serious and deliberate opinion.” Steel v. Houghton, 1 Bl. H. 51, 53, 126 Eng. Rep. 32, 33 (C.P. 1788). To do so would work an “injustice to [the] memory” of their predecessors who could not expect judicial 5 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring remarks issued in one context to apply perfectly in others, perhaps especially ones they could not foresee. Ibid. Also, the limits of the adversarial process, a distinctive feature of English law, had to be borne in mind. When a single judge or a small panel reached a decision in a case, they did so based on the factual record and legal arguments the parties at hand have chosen to develop. Attuned to those con - straints, future judges had to proceed with an open mind to the possibility that different facts and different legal argu- ments might dictate different outcomes in later disputes. See Duxbury 19–24. B Necessarily, this represents just a quick sketch of tradi- tional common-law understandings of the judge’s role and the place of precedent in it. It focuses, too, on the horizon- tal, not vertical, force of judi cial precedents. But there are good reasons to think that the common law’s understand-ings of judges and precedent outlined above crossed the At-lantic and informed the nature of the “judicial Power” the Constitution vests in federal courts. Art. III, §1. Not only was the Constitution adopted against the back- drop of these understandings and , in light of that alone, they may provide evidence of what the framers meant when they spoke of the “judicial Po wer.” Many other, more spe- cific provisions in the Constitution reflect much the same distinction between lawmaking and lawfinding functions the common law did. The Constitution provides that its terms may be amended only through certain prescribed democratic processes. Art. V.It vests the power to enact federal legislation exclusively in the people’s elected repre- sentatives in Congress. Art. I, §1. Meanwhile, the Consti - tution describes the judicial power as the power to resolve cases and controversies. Art. III, §2, cl. 1. As well, it dele- gates that authority to life-tenured judges, see §1, an as - signment that would have made little sense if judges could 6 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring usurp lawmaking powers vested in periodically elected rep- resentatives. But one that makes perfect sense if what is sought is a neutral party “to interpret and apply” the law without fear or favor in a dispute between others. 2 The Works of James Wilson 161 (J.Andrews ed. 1896) (Wilson); see Osborn v. Bank of United States , 9 Wheat. 738, 866 (1824). The constrained view of the judicial power that runs through our Constitution carries with it familiar implica- tions, ones the framers readily acknowledged. James Mad- ison, for example, proclaimed t hat it would be a “fallacy” to suggest that judges or their precedents could “repeal or al-ter” the Constitution or the laws of the United States. Let-ter to N.Trist (Dec. 1831), in 9 The Writings of James Mad- ison 477 (G.Hunt ed. 1910). A court’s opinion, James Wilson added, may be thought of as “effective la[w]” “[a]s to the parties.” Wilson 160–161. But as in England, Wilsonsaid, a prior judicial decision could serve in a future disputeonly as “evidence” of the law’s proper construction. Id., at 160; accord, 1 J.Kent, Commentaries on American Law 442–443 (1826). The framers also recognized that the judicial power de - scribed in our Constitution implies, as the judicial powerdid in England, a power (and duty) of discrimination when it comes to assessing the “evidence” embodied in past deci- sions. So, for example, Madiso n observed that judicial rul- ings “ repeatedly confirmed ” may supply better evidence of the law’s meaning than isolated or aberrant ones. Letter to C.Ingersoll (June 1831), in 4 Letters and Other Writings of James Madison 184 (1867) (emphasis added). Extendingthe thought, Thomas Jefferson believed it would often take “numerous decisions” for the meaning of new statutes to be - come truly “settled.” Letter to S.Jones (July 1809), in 12 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 299 (A.Bergh ed. 1907). From the start, too, American courts recognized that not everything found in a prior decision was entitled to equal 7 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring weight. As Chief Justice Marshall warned, “It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821). To the extent a past court offered views“beyond the case,” those expressions “may be respected” in a later case “but ought not to control the judgment.” Ibid. One “obvious” reason for this, Marshall continued, had to do with the limits of the adversarial process we inherited from England: Only “[t]he question actually before the Court is investigated with ca re, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom com- pletely investigated.” Id., at 399–400. Abraham Lincoln championed these traditional under- standings in his debates with Stephen Douglas. Douglas took the view that a single decision of this Court—no mat- ter how flawed—could definitive ly resolve a contested issue for everyone and all time. Those who thought otherwise, he said, “aim[ed] a deadly blow to our whole Republican sys- tem of government.” Speech at Springfield, Ill. (June 26, 1857), in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 401 (R.Basler ed. 1953) (Lincoln Speech). But Lincoln knew better. While accepting that judicial decisions “absolutely deter- mine” the rights of the parties to a court’s judgment, he re-fused to accept that any single judicial decision could “fully settl[e]” an issue, particularly when that decision departs from the Constitution. Id., at 400–401. In cases such as these, Lincoln explained, “it is not resistance, it is not fac-tious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat [the decision] as not having yet quite establishe d a settled doctrine for the country.” Id., at 401. After the Civil War, the Court echoed some of these same points. It stressed that every statement in a judicial opin- 8 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring ion “must be taken in connection with its immediate con- text,” In re Ayers , 123 U.S. 443, 488 (1887), and stray “re - marks” must not be elevated above the written law, see The Belfast , 7 Wall. 624, 641 (1869); see also, e .g., Trebilcock v. Wilson , 12 Wall. 687, 692–693 (1872); Mason v. Eldred , 6 Wall. 231, 236–238 (1868). During Chief Justice Chase’s tenure, it seems a Justice writ ing the Court’s majority opin- ion would generally work alone and present his work orally and in summary form to his colleagues at conference, which meant that other Justices often did not even review the opinion prior to publication. 6 C.Fairman, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 69–70 (1971). The Court could proceed in this way because it understood that a single judicial opinion may resolve a “case or controversy,” and in so doing it may make “effective law” for the parties, but it does not legislate for the whole of the country and is not to be confused with laws that do. C From all this, I see at least three lessons about the doc- trine of stare decisis relevant to the decision before us today. Each concerns a form of judicial humility. First , a past decision may bind the parties to a dispute, but it provides this Court no authority in future cases todepart from what the Constitution or laws of the United States ordain. Instead, the Constitution promises, the American people are sovereign and they alone may, through democratically respon sive processes, amend our foundational charter or revise federal legislation. Une- lected judges enjoy no su ch power. Part I–B, supra. Recognizing as much, this Court has often said that stare decisis is not an “ ‘inexorable command.’ ” State Oil Co. v. Khan , 522 U.S. 3, 20 (1997). And from time to time it has found it necessary to correct its past mistakes. When it comes to correcting errors of constitutional interpretation, the Court has stressed the importance of doing so, for they 9 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring can be corrected otherwise only through the amendment process. See, e.g., Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U.S. 230, 248 (2019). When it comes to fixing errors of stat- utory interpretation, the Court has proceeded perhaps more circumspectly. But in that field, too, it has overruled even longstanding but “flawed” decisions. See, e.g., Leegin Crea - tive Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. , 551 U.S. 877, 904, 907 (2007). Recent history illustrates all this. During the tenures of Chief Justices Warren and Burger, it seems this Court over-ruled an average of around three cases per Term, including roughly 50 statutory precedents between the 1960s and 1980s alone. See W.Eskridge, Overruling Statutory Prec - edents, 76 Geo. L.J. 1361, 1427–1434 (1988) (collecting cases). Many of these decisions came in settings no lessconsequential than today’s. In recent years, we have not approached the pace set by our predecessors, overruling an average of just one or two prior decisions each Term. 1 But the point remains: Judicial decisions inconsistent with the written law do not inexorably control. Second, another lesson tempers the first. While judicial decisions may not supersede or revise the Constitution orfederal statutory law, they merit our “respect as embodying the considered views of those who have come before.” Ra- mos v. Louisiana , 590 U.S. 83, 105 (2020). As a matter of professional responsibility, a judge must not only avoid con- fusing his writings with the law. When a case comes before him, he must also weigh his view of what the law demands against the thoughtful views of his predecessors. After all, “[p]recedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom —————— 1For relevant databases of decisions, see Congressional Research Ser- vice, Table of Supreme Court Decisi ons Overruled by Subsequent Deci - sions, Constitution Annotated, https ://constitution.congress.gov/resources/ decisions-overruled/; see also H.Spaeth et al., 2023 Supreme Court Da- tabase, http://supremecourtdatabase.org. 10 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges.” Precedent 9. Doubtless, past judicial decisions may, as they always have, command “greater or less authority as precedents, ac-cording to circumstances.” Lincoln Speech 401. But, like English judges before us, we have long turned to familiar considerations to guide our a ssessment of the weight due a past decision. So, for example, as this Court has put it, the weight due a precedent may depend on the quality of its reasoning, its consistency with related decisions, its worka - bility, and reliance interests t hat have formed around it. See Ramos , 590 U.S., at 106. The first factor recognizes that the primary power of any precedent lies in its power to persuade—and poorly reasoned decisions may not provide reliable evidence of the law’s meaning. The second factor reflects the fact that a precedent is more likely to be correctand worthy of respect when it reflects the time-tested wis- dom of generations than when it sits “unmoored” from sur- rounding law. Ibid. The remaining factors, like workability and reliance, do not often supply reason enough on their own to abide a flawed decision, for almost any past decision is likely to benefit some group eager to keep things as they are and content with how things work. See, e.g. , id., at 108. But these factors can sometimes serve functions similar to the others, by pointing to clues that may suggest a past de - cision is right in ways not immediately obvious to the indi-vidual judge. When asking whether to follow or depart from a prece - dent, some judges deploy adverbs. They speak of whether or not a precedent qualifies as “demonstrably erroneous,” Gamble v. United States , 587 U.S. 678, 711 (2019) (T HOMAS , J., concurring), or “egregiously wrong,” Ramos , 590 U.S., at 121 (K AVANAUGH , J., concurring in part). But the emphasis the adverb imparts is not meant for dramaticeffect. It seeks to serve instead as a reminder of a more substantive lesson. The lesson that, in assessing the weight 11 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring due a past decision, a judge is not to be guided by his own impression alone, but must self-consciously test his views against those who have come before, open to the possibility that a precedent might be correct in ways not initially ap- parent to him. Third , it would be a mistake to read judicial opinions like statutes. Adopted through a ro bust and democratic process, statutes often apply in all their particulars to all persons. By contrast, when judges reach a decision in our adversar - ial system, they render a judg ment based only on the fac- tual record and legal arguments the parties at hand have chosen to develop. A later co urt assessing a past decision must therefore appreciate the possibility that different facts and different legal argu ments may dictate a different outcome. They must appreciate , too, that, like anyone else, judges are “innately digressive,” and their opinions may sometimes offer stray asides about a wider topic that may sound nearly like legislative commands. Duxbury 4. Often, enterprising counsel seek to exploit such statements to maximum effect. See id., at 25. But while these digressions may sometimes contain valuable counsel, they remain “va-pours and fumes of law,” Bacon 478, and cannot “control the judgment in a subsequent suit,” Cohens , 6 Wheat., at 399. These principles, too, have long guided this Court and others. As Judge Easterbrook has put it, an “opinion is not a comprehensive code; it is just an explanation for the Court’s disposition. Judicial opinions must not be confused with statutes, and general expressions must be read in light of the subject under consideration.” United States v. Skoien , 614 F. 638, 640 (CA7 2010) (en banc); see also Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 341 (1979) (stress- ing that an opinion is not “a statute,” and its language should not “be parsed” as if it were); Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353, 372 (2001) (same). If stare decisis counsels re- spect for the thinking of those who have come before, it also counsels against doing an “injus tice to [their] memory” by 12 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring overreliance on their every word. Steel, 1 Bl. H., at 53, 126 Eng. Rep., at 33. As judges , “[w]e neither expect nor hope that our successors will comb” through our opinions, searching for delphic answers to matters we never fully ex- plored. Brown v. Davenport , 596 U.S. 118, 141 (2022). To proceed otherwise risks “turn[ing] stare decisis from a tool of judicial humility into one of judicial hubris.” Ibid. II Turning now directly to the question what stare decisis effect Chevron deference warrants, each of these lessons seem to me to weigh firmly in favor of the course the Court charts today: Lesson 1, because Chevron deference contra- venes the law Congress prescri bed in the Administrative Procedure Act. Lesson 2, because Chevron deference runs against mainstream currents in our law regarding the sep- aration of powers, due process, and centuries-old interpre- tive rules that fortify those constitutional commitments. And Lesson 3, because to hold otherwise would effectively require us to endow stray statements in Chevron with the authority of statutory language, all while ignoring moreconsidered language in that same decision and the teach- ings of experience. A Start with Lesson 1. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) directs a “reviewing court” to “decide all rel- evant questions of law” and “i nterpret” relevant “constitu - tional and statutory provisions.” 5 U.S. C. §706. When ap-plying Chevron deference, reviewing courts do not interpret all relevant statutory provisions and decide all relevant questions of law. Instead, judges abdicate a large measure of that responsibility in favor of agency officials. Their in- terpretations of “ambiguous” laws control even when those interpretations are at odds with the fairest reading of the law an independent “reviewing court” can muster. Agency 13 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring officials, too, may change their minds about the law’s mean- ing at any time, even when Congress has not amended the relevant statutory language in any way. National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services , 545 U.S. 967, 982–983 (2005). And those officials may even dis- agree with and effectively overrule not only their own past interpretations of a law but a court’s past interpretation as well. Ibid. None of that is consistent with the APA’s clear mandate. The hard fact is Chevron “did not even bother to cite” the APA, let alone seek to apply its terms. United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218, 241 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissent- ing). Instead, as even its most ardent defenders have con- ceded, Chevron deference rests upon a “ fictionalized state- ment of legislative desire,” namely, a judicial supposition that Congress implicitly wishes judges to defer to executive agencies’ interpretations of the law even when it has said nothing of the kind. D.Barron & E.Kagan, Chevron’s Non- delegation Doctrine, 2001 S.Ct. Rev. 201, 212 (Kagan) (em- phasis added). As proponents see it, that fiction represents a “policy judgmen[t] about what . . . make[s] for good gov-ernment.” Ibid. 2 But in our democracy unelected judges possess no authority to elevate their own fictions over thelaws adopted by the Nation’s el ected representatives. Some might think the legal directive Congress provided in the APA unwise; some might thin k a different arrangement preferable. See, e.g., post, at 9–11 (K AGAN , J., dissenting). But it is Congress’s view of “good government,” not ours, that controls. —————— 2See also A.Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpreta - tions of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 516–517 (1989) (describing Chevron ’s theory that Congress “delegat[ed]” inte rpretive authority to agencies as “fictional”); S.Breyer, Judicial Revi ew of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin. L.Rev. 363, 370 (1986) (describing the notion that there exists a “ ‘legislative intent to delegate the law-interpreting function’ as a kind of legal fiction”). 14 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring Much more could be said about Chevron ’s inconsistency with the APA.But I have said it in the past. See Buffington v. McDonough , 598 U.S. ___, ___–___ (2022) (opinion dis- senting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5–6); Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, 834 F. 1142, 1151–1153 (CA10 2016) (concurring opinion). And the Court makes many of the same points at length today. See ante, at 18– 22. For present purposes, the short of it is that continuing to abide Chevron deference would require us to transgress the first lesson of stare decisis—the humility required ofjudges to recognize that our decisions must yield to the laws adopted by the people’s elected representatives. 3 B Lesson 2 cannot rescue Chevron deference. If stare deci- sis calls for judicial humility in the face of the written law, it also cautions us to test our present conclusions carefullyagainst the work of our predecessors. At the same time and as we have seen, this second form of humility counsels us to remember that precedents that have won the endorsement of judges across many generations, demonstrated coherence with our broader law, and weathered the tests of time and experience are entitled to greater consideration than those that have not. See Part I, supra. Viewed by each of these lights, the case for Chevron deference only grows weaker still. —————— 3The dissent suggests that we need not take the APA’s directions quite so seriously because the “finest administrative law scholars” from Har - vard claim to see in them some wiggle room. Post , at 18 (opinion of KAGAN , J.). But nothing in the APA comm ands deference to the views of professors any more than it does th e government. Nor is the dissent’s list of Harvard’s finest administrative law scholars entirely complete. See S.Breyer et al., Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 288 (7th ed. 2011) (acknowledging that Chevron deference “seems in conflict with . . . the apparently contrary language of 706”); Kagan 212 (likewise ac - knowledging Chevron deference rests upon a “f ictionalized statement of legislative desire”). 15 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring 1 Start with a look to how our predecessors traditionally understood the judicial role in disputes over a law’s mean- ing. From the Nation’s founding, they considered “[t]he in- terpretation of the laws” in cases and controversies “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 467 (C.Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.Hamilton). Perhaps the Court’s most famous early decision reflected exactly that view. There, Chief Justice Marshall declared it “em- phatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” Marbury , 1 Cranch, at 177. For judges “have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judg- ment”—and an obligation to exe rcise that judgment inde- pendently. The Federalist No. 78, at 465. No matter how “disagreeable that duty may be,” this Court has said, a judge “is not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.” United States v. Dickson , 15 Pet. 141, 162 (1841) (Story, J.). This duty of independent judgment is perhaps “the defining characteristi[c] of Article III judges.” Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462, 483 (2011). To be sure, this Court has also long extended “great re- spect” to the “contemporaneous” and consistent views of the coordinate branches about the meani ng of a statute’s terms. Edwards’ Lessee v. Darby , 12 Wheat. 206, 210 (1827); see also McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); Stu- art v. Laird , 1 Cranch 299, 309 (1803). 4 But traditionally, that did not mean a court had to “defer” to any “reasonable” —————— 4Accord, National Lead Co. v. United States , 252 U.S. 140, 145–146 (1920) (affording “great weight” to a “contemporaneous construction” by the executive that had “been long continued”); Jacobs v. Prichard , 223 U.S. 200, 214 (1912) (“find[ing] no ambiguity in the act” but also finding “strength” for the Court’s interpreta tion in the executive’s “immediate and continued construction of the act”); Schell’s Executors v. Fauché , 138 U.S. 562, 572 (1891) (treating as “controlling” a “c ontemporaneous con- struction” of a law endorsed “not only [by] the courts but [also by] the departments”). 16 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring construction of an “ambiguous” law that an executive agency might offer. It did not mean that the government could propound a “reasonable” view of the law’s meaning one day, a different one the next, and bind the judiciary al- ways to its latest word. Nor did it mean the executive could displace a pre-existing judicial construction of a statute’s terms, replace it with its own, and effectively overrule a ju- dicial precedent in the process. Put simply, this Court was “not bound” by any and all reasonable “administrative con- struction[s]” of ambiguous statutes when resolving cases and controversies. Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co. , 285 U.S. 1, 16 (1932). While the executive’s consistent and contem-poraneous views warranted respect, they “by no means con-trol[led] the action or the opinion of this court in expound- ing the law with reference to the rights of parties litigant before them.” Irvine v. Marshall , 20 How. 558, 567 (1858); see also A.Bamzai, The Origins of Judicial Deference to Ex-ecutive Interpretation, 126 Yale L.J. 908, 987 (2017). Sensing how jarringly inconsistent Chevron is with this Court’s many longstanding precedents discussing the na-ture of the judicial role in disputes over the law’s meaning, the government and dissent struggle for a response. The best they can muster is a handful of cases from the early1940s in which, they say, this Court first “put [deference] principles into action.” Post, at 21 (K AGAN , J., dissenting). And, admittedly, for a period this Court toyed with a form of deference akin to Chevron , at least for so-called mixed questions of law and fact. See, e.g., Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 411–412 (1941); NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 131 (1944). But, as the Court details, even that limited experi ment did not last. See ante, at 10– 12. Justice Roberts, in his Gray dissent, decried these de- cisions for “abdicat[ing our] function as a court of review” and “complete[ly] revers[ing] . . . the normal and usual method of construing a statute.” 314 U.S., at 420–421. And just a few years later, in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. , 323 17 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring U.S. 134 (1944), the Court returned to its time-worn path. Echoing themes that had run throughout our law from its start, Justice Robert H.Jackson wrote for the Court in Skidmore. There, he said, courts may extend respectful consideration to another branch’ s interpretation of the law, but the weight due those interpretations must always “de-pend upon the[ir] thoroughness . . . , the validity of [their] reasoning, [their] consistency with earlier and later pro-nouncements, and all those factors which give [them] power to persuade.” Id., at 140. In another case the same year, and again writing for the Court, Justice Jackson expressly rejected a call for a judge-made doctrine of deference much like Chevron , offering that, “[i]f Congress had deemed it necessary or even appropriate” for courts to “defe[r] to ad-ministrative construction[,] . . . it would not have been at a loss for words to say so.” Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 144, 156 (1944). To the extent proper respect for precedent demands, as it always has, special respect for longstanding and main-stream decisions, Chevron scores badly. It represented not a continuation of a long line of decisions but a break from them. Worse, it did not merely depart from our precedents. More nearly, Chevron defied them. 2 Consider next how uneasily Chevron deference sits along- side so many other settled aspe cts of our law. Having wit- nessed first-hand King George’s efforts to gain influence and control over colonial judges, see Declaration of Inde- pendence ¶ 11, the framers made a considered judgment to build judicial independence into the Constitution’s design. They vested the judicial power in decisionmakers with life tenure. Art. III, §1. They placed the judicial salary beyond political control during a judge’s tenure. Ibid. And they rejected any proposal that would subject judicial decisionsto review by political actors. The Federalist No. 81, at 482; 18 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring United States v. Hansen , 599 U.S. 762, 786–791 (2023) (THOMAS , J., concurring). All of this served to ensure the same thing: “A fair trial in a fair tribunal.” In re Murchi - son, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955). One in which impartial judges, not those currently wielding power in the political branches, would “say what the law is” in cases coming to court. Marbury , 1 Cranch, at 177. Chevron deference undermines all that. It precludes courts from exercising the judi cial power vested in them by Article III to say what the law is. It forces judges to aban-don the best reading of the law in favor of views of those presently holding the reins of the Executive Branch. It re - quires judges to change, and change again, their interpre- tations of the law as and when the government demands. And that transfer of power has exactly the sort of conse- quences one might expect. Rather than insulate adjudica-tion from power and politics to ensure a fair hearing “with-out respect to persons” as the federal judicial oath demands, 28 U.S. C. §453, Chevron deference requires courts to “place a finger on the scales of justice in favor of the most powerful of litigants, the federal government.” Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). Along the way, Chevron deference guarantees “systematic bias” in favor of which- ever political party currently holds the levers of executive power. P.Hamburger, Chevron Bias, 84 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 1187, 1212 (2016). Chevron deference undermines other aspects of our set- tled law, too. In this country, we often boast that the Con-stitution’s promise of due proce ss of law, see Amdts. 5, 14, means that “ ‘no man can be a judge in his own case.’ ” Wil- liams v. Pennsylvania , 579 U.S. 1, 8–9 (2016); Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.). That principle, of course, has even deeper roots, tracing far back into the common law where it was known by the Latin maxim nemo iudex in causa sua . See 1 E.Coke, Institutes 19 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring of the Laws of England §212, *141a. Yet, under the Chev - ron regime, all that means little, for executive agencies may effectively judge the scope of their own lawful powers. See, e.g., Arlington v. FCC , 569 U.S. 290, 296–297 (2013). Traditionally, as well, courts have sought to construe statutes as a reasonable reader would “when the law was made.” Blackstone 59; see United States v. Fisher , 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805). Today, some call this “textualism.” But really it’s a very old idea, one that constrains judges to a lawfinding rather than lawmaking role by focusing their work on the statutory text, its linguistic context, and vari - ous canons of construction. In that way, textualism servesas an essential guardian of the due process promise of fair notice. If a judge could discard an old meaning and assign a new one to a law’s terms, al l without any legislative revi- sion, how could people ever be sure of the rules that bind them? New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, 586 U.S. 105, 113 (2019). Were the rules otherwise, Blackstone warned, the people would be rendered “sla ves to their magistrates.” 4 Blackstone 371. Yet, replace “magistrates” wi th “bureaucrats,” and Black- stone’s fear becomes rea lity when courts employ Chevron deference. Whenever we confront an ambiguity in the law, judges do not seek to resolve it impartially according to the best evidence of the law’s original meaning. Instead, we re-sort to a far cruder heuristic: “The reasonable bureaucrat always wins.” And because the reasonable bureaucrat may change his mind year-to-year and election-to-election, the people can never know with certainty what new “interpre- tations” might be used against them. This “fluid” approach to statutory interpretation is “as much a trap for the inno- cent as the ancient laws of Caligula,” which were posted sohigh up on the walls and in print so small that ordinary people could never be sure what they required. United States v. Cardiff, 344 U.S. 174, 176 (1952). 20 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring The ancient rule of lenity is still another of Chevron ’s vic- tims. Since the founding, American courts have construed ambiguities in penal laws against the government and withlenity toward affected persons. Wooden v. United States , 595 U.S. 360, 388–390 (2022) (G ORSUCH , J., concurring in judgment). That principle upholds due process by safe- guarding individual liberty in the face of ambiguous laws. Ibid. And it fortifies the separation of powers by keeping the power of punishment firmly “ ‘in the legislative, not in the judicial department.’ ” Id. , at 391 (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820)). But power begets power. And pressing Chevron deference as far as it can go, the government has so metimes managed to leverage “ambiguities” in the written law to penalize conduct Con - gress never clearly proscribed. Compare Guedes v. ATF, 920 F. 1, 27–28, 31 (CADC 2019), with Garland v. Car- gill, 602 U.S. 604 (2024). In all these ways, Chevron ’s fiction has led us to a strange place. One where authorities long thought reserved for Ar- ticle III are transferred to Article II, where the scales of jus- tice are tilted systematically in favor of the most powerful,where legal demands can change with every election even though the laws do not, and where the people are left to guess about their legal rights and responsibilities. So much tension with so many foundational features of our legal or - der is surely one more sign that we have “taken a wrong turn along the way.” Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 607 (2019) (G ORSUCH , J., concurring in judgment).5 —————— 5The dissent suggests that Chevron deference bears at least something in common with surrounding law becaus e it resembles a presumption or traditional canon of construction, and both “are common.” Post, at 8, n. 1, 28–29 (opinion of K AGAN , J.). But even that thin reed wavers at a glance. Many of the presumptions and inte rpretive canons the dissent cites— including lenity, contra proferentem , and others besides—“ ‘embod[y] . . . legal doctrine[s] centuries older than our Republic.’ ” Opati v. Republic of Sudan , 590 U.S. 418, 425 (2020). Chevron deference can make no such boast. Many of the presumptions and canons the dissent cites also 21 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring 3 Finally, consider workability and reliance. If, as I have sought to suggest, these factors may sometimes serve as useful proxies for the question whether a precedent com- ports with the historic tide of judicial practice or represents an aberrational mistake, see Part I–C, supra, they certainly do here. Take Chevron ’s “workability.” Throughout its short life, this Court has been forced to supplement and revise Chev- ron so many times that no one can agree on how many “steps” it requires, nor even w hat each of those “steps” en- tails. Some suggest that the analysis begins with “step zero” (perhaps itself a tell), an innovation that traces to United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218. Mead held that, before even considering whether Chevron applies, a court must determine whether Congre ss meant to delegate to the agency authority to interpret th e law in a given field. 533 U.S., at 226–227. But that exercise faces an immediate challenge: Because Chevron depends on a judicially im- plied, rather than a legislatively expressed, delegation ofinterpretive authority to an executive agency, Part II–A, su- pra, when should the fiction apply and when not? Mead fashioned a multifactor test for judges to use. 533 U.S., at —————— serve the Constitution, protecting the lines of authority it draws. Take just two examples: The federalism cano n tells courts to presume federal statutes do not preempt state laws be cause of the sovereignty States en - joy under the Constitution. Bond v. United States , 572 U.S. 844, 858 (2014). The presumption against retroactivity serves as guardian of the Constitution’s promise of due process and its ban on ex post facto laws, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 265 (1994). Once more, however, Chevron deference can make no similar claim. Rather than serve the Constitution’s usual rule that litigants are entitled to have an independent judge interpret disputed legal terms, Chevron deference works to undermine that promise. As explored above, too, Chevron def- erence sits in tension with many tr aditional legal presumptions and in- terpretive principles, representing nearly the inverse of the rules of len- ity, nemo iudex , and contra proferentem . 22 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring 229–231. But that test has proved as indeterminate in ap- plication as it was contrived in origin. Perhaps for these reasons, perhaps for others, this Court has sometimes ap- plied Mead and often ignored it. See Brand X , 545 U.S., at 1014, n. 8 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Things do not improve as we move up the Chevron ladder. At “step one,” a judge must de fer to an executive official’s interpretation when the statute at hand is “ambiguous.” But even today, Chevron ’s principal beneficiary—the fed- eral government—still cannot say when a statute is suffi-ciently ambiguous to trigger deference. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. in American Hospital Assn. v. Becerra , O.T. 2021, No. 20–1114, pp. 71–72. Perhaps thanks to this particular confusion, the search for ambiguity has devolved into a sort of Snark hunt: Some judges claim to spot it almost every- where, while other equally fine judges claim never to have seen it. Compare L.Silberman, Chevron —The Intersection of Law & Policy, 58 Geo. Wash. L.Rev. 821, 826 (1990), withR.Kethledge, Ambiguities and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the Bench, 70 Vand. L.Rev. EnBanc 315, 323 (2017). Nor do courts agree when it comes to “step two.” There, a judge must assess whether an executive agency’s inter-pretation of an ambiguous statute is “reasonable.” But what does that inquiry demand? Some courts engage in a comparatively searching review ; others almost reflexively defer to an agency’s views. He re again, courts have pursued “wildly different” approaches and reached wildly differentconclusions in similar cases. See B.Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L.Rev. 2118, 2152 (2016) (Kavanaugh). Today’s cases exemplify some of these problems. We have before us two circuit decisions, three opinions, and at leastas many interpretive options on the Chevron menu. On the one hand, we have the D.C. Circuit majority, which deemed the Magnuson-Stevens Act “ambiguous” and upheld the 23 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring agency’s regulation as “ ‘permissible.’ ” 45 F. 359, 365 (2022). On the other hand, we have the D.C. Circuit dis-sent, which argues the statute is “unambiguou[s]” and that it plainly forecloses th e agency’s new rule. Id., at 372 (opin - ion of Walker, J.). And on yet a third hand, we have the First Circuit, which claimed to have identified “clear tex - tual support” for the regulation, yet refused to say whetherit would “classify [its] conclusion as a product of Chevron step one or step two.” 62 F. 621, 631, 634 (2023). As these cases illustrate, Chevron has turned statutory inter- pretation into a game of bingo under blindfold, with partiesguessing at how many boxes there are and which one their case might ultimately fall in. Turn now from workability to reliance. Far from engen- dering reliance interests, the whole point of Chevron defer- ence is to upset them. Under Chevron, executive officials can replace one “reasonable” inte rpretation with another at any time, all without any change in the law itself. The re - sult: Affected individuals “can never be sure of their legal rights and duties.” Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). How bad is the problem? Take just one example. Brand X concerned a law regulating broadband internet services. There, the Court upheld an agency rule adopted by the ad-ministration of President George W.Bush because it was premised on a “reasonable” interpretation of the statute. Later, President Barack Obam a’s administration rescinded the rule and replaced it with another. Later still, duringPresident Donald J.Trump’s administration, officials re-placed that rule with a different one, all before President Joseph R.Biden, Jr.’s administration declared its intention to reverse course for yet a fourth time. See Safeguardingand Securing the Open Internet, 88 Fed. Reg. 76048 (2023); Brand X, 545 U.S., at 981–982. Each time, the government claimed its new rule was just as “reasonable” as the last. Rather than promoting reliance by fixing the meaning of 24 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring the law, Chevron deference engenders constant uncertainty and convulsive change even when the statute at issue itself remains unchanged. Nor are these antireliance har ms distributed equally. So- phisticated entities and their lawyers may be able to keep pace with rule changes affecting their rights and responsi- bilities. They may be able to lobby for new “ ‘reasonable’ ” agency interpretations and even capture the agencies that issue them. Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 13). But ordinary people can do none of those things. Theyare the ones who suffer the worst kind of regulatory whip- lash Chevron invites. Consider a couple of examples. Thomas Buffington, a vet- eran of the U.S. Air Force, was injured in the line of duty. For a time after he left th e Air Force, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) paid disability benefits due him by law. But later the government called on Mr. Buffington to reenter active service. During that period, everyone agreed, the VA could (as it did) suspend his disability payments. After he left active service for a second time, however, the VA turned his patriotism against him. By law, Congress permitted the VA to suspend disability pay only “for any period for which [a servicemember] receives active service pay.” 38 U.S. C. §5304(c). But the VA had adopted a self- serving regulation requiring vete rans to file a form asking for the resumption of their disability pay after a second (or subsequent) stint in active service. 38 CFR §3.654(b)(2) (2021). Unaware of the regulation, Mr. Buffington failed toreapply immediately. When he finally figured out what had happened and reapplied, the VA agreed to resume pay- ments going forward but refused to give Mr. Buffington all of the past disability payments it had withheld. Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–4). Mr. Buffington challenged the agency’s action as incon- sistent with Congress’s direction that the VA may suspend disability payments only for those periods when a veteran 25 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring returns to active service. But armed with Chevron , the agency defeated Mr. Buffington’s claim. Maybe the self- serving regulation the VA cited as justification for its actionwas not premised on the best reading of the law, courts said, but it represented a “ ‘permissible’ ” one. 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). In that way, the Executive Branch was able to evade Congress’s promises to someone who took the field repeatedly in the Nation’s defense. In another case, one which I heard as a court of appeals judge, De Niz Robles v. Lynch , 803 F. 1165 (CA10 2015), the Board of Immigration Appeals invoked Chevron to over - rule a judicial precedent on which many immigrants had relied, see In re Briones , 24 I. & N.Dec. 355, 370 (BIA 2007) (purporting to overrule Padilla–Caldera v. Gonzales , 426 F. 1294 (CA10 2005)). The agency then sought to apply its new interpretation retroactively to punish those immi-grants—including Alfonzo De Niz Robles, who had relied onthat judicial precedent as autho rity to remain in this coun- try with his U.S. wife and four children. See 803 F. 3d, at 1168–1169. Our court ruled that this retrospective applica - tion of the BIA’s new interpretation of the law violated Mr. De Niz Robles’s due process rights. Id., at 1172. But as a lower court, we could treat only the symptom, not the dis-ease. So Chevron permitted the agency going forward to overrule a judicial decision about the best reading of the law with its own different “reasonable” one and in that way deny relief to countless future immigrants. Those are just two stories among so many that federal judges could tell (and have told) about what Chevron defer- ence has meant for ordinary people interacting with the fed - eral government. See, e.g., Lambert v. Saul , 980 F. 1266, 1268–1276 (CA9 2020); Valent v. Commissioner of Social Security , 918 F. 516, 525–527 (CA6 2019) (Kethledge, J., dissenting); Gonzalez v. United States Atty. Gen. , 820 F. 399, 402–405 (CA11 2016) ( per curiam ). What does the federal government have to say about this? 26 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring It acknowledges that Chevron sits as a heavy weight on the scale in favor of the government, “oppositional” to many “categories of individuals.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–1219, p. 133 (Relentless Tr.). But, according to the government, Chevron deference is too important an innovation to undo. In its brief reign, the government says, it has become a “fun- damenta[l] . . . ground rul[e] for how all three branches of the government are operating together.” Relentless Tr. 102. But, in truth, the Constitution, the APA, and our longstanding precedents set those ground rules some time ago. And under them, agencies cannot invoke a judge-made fiction to unsettle our Nation’s promise to individuals that they are entitled to make their arguments about the law’s demands on them in a fair hearing, one in which they stand on equal footing with the gove rnment before an independ- ent judge. C How could a Court, guided for 200 years by Chief Justice Marshall’s example, come to embrace a counter- Marbury revolution, one at war with the APA, time honored prece- dents, and so much surrounding law? To answer these questions, turn to Lesson 3 and witness the temptation to endow a stray passage in a judicial decision with extraordi-nary authority. Call it “power quoting.” Chevron was an unlikely place for a revolution to begin. The case concerned the Clean Air Act’s requirement that States regulate “stationary sou rces” of air pollution in their borders. See 42 U.S. C. §7401 et seq . At the time, it was an open question whether entire industrial plants or their constituent polluting parts counted as “stationary sources.” The Environmental Protection Agency had defined entire plants as sources, an approach that allowed companies to replace individual plant parts without automatically trig- gering the permitting requi rements that apply to new sources. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 840. 27 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring This Court upheld the EPA’s definition as consistent with the governing statute. Id., at 866. The decision, issued by a bare quorum of the Court, without concurrence or dissent, purported to apply “well-settled principles.” Id., at 845. “If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construc- tion, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the pre- cise question at issue,” Chevron provided, then “that inten- tion is the law and must be given effect.” Id., at 843, n. 9. Many of the cases Chevron cited to support its judgment stood for the traditional proposition that courts afford re - spectful consideration, not deference, to executive interpre - tations of the law. See, e.g., Burnet , 285 U.S., at 16; United States v. Moore , 95 U.S. 760, 763 (1878). And the decision’s sole citation to legal schola rship was to Roscoe Pound, who long championed de novo judicial review. 467 U.S., at 843, n. 10; see R.Pound, The Place of the Judiciary in a Demo- cratic Polity, 27 A.B. A.J. 133, 136–137 (1941). At the same time, of course, the opinion contained bits and pieces that spoke differently. The decision also said that, “if [a] statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to [a] specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.” 467 U.S., at 843. But it seems the govern - ment didn’t advance this formulation in its brief, so there was no adversarial engagement on it. T.Merrill, The Story of Chevron : The Making of an Accidental Landmark, 66 Ad- min. L.Rev. 253, 268 (2014) (Merrill). As we have seen, too, the Court did not pause to consider (or even mention) the APA.See Part II–A, supra. It did not discuss contrary prec-edents issued by the Court since the founding, let alone pur- port to overrule any of them. See Part II–B–1, supra. Nor did the Court seek to address ho w its novel rule of deference might be squared with so much surrounding law. See Part II–B–2, supra. As even its defenders have acknowledged, “Chevron barely bothered to justify its rule of deference, and the few brief passages on this matter pointed in disparate 28 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring directions.” Kagan 212–213. “[T]he quality of the reason- ing,” they acknowledge, “was not high,” C.Sunstein, Chev- ron as Law, 107 Geo. L.J. 1613, 1669 (2019). If Chevron meant to usher in a revolution in how judges interpret laws, no one appears to have realized it at the time. Chevron ’s author, Justice Stevens, characterized the decision as a “simpl[e] . . . restatement of existing law, noth-ing more or less.” Merrill 255, 275. In the “19 argued cases” in the following Term “that presented some kind of question about whether the Court should defer to an agency inter-pretation of statutory law,” this Court cited Chevron just once. Merrill 276. By some accounts, the decision seemed“destined to obscurity.” Ibid. It was only three years later when Justice Scalia wrote a concurrence that a revolution began to take shape. Buff- ington , 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). There, he argued for a new rule requiring courts to defer to executive agencyinterpretations of the law whenever a “ ‘statute is silent or ambiguous.’ ” NLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers , 484 U.S. 112, 133–134 (1987) (opinion of Scalia, J.). Even-tually, a majority of the Court followed his lead. Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 8). But from the start, Justice Scalia made no secret about the scope of his ambitions. See Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 521 (1989) (Scalia). The rule he advocated for represented such a sharp break from priorpractice, he explained, that many judges of his day didn’t yet “understand” the “old criteria” were “no longer rele- vant.” Ibid. Still, he said, overthrowing the past was worth it because a new deferential rule would be “easier to follow.” Ibid. Events proved otherwise. As the years wore on and the Court’s new and aggressive reading of Chevron gradually exposed itself as unworkable, unfair, and at odds with our separation of powers, Justice Scalia could have doubled down on the project. But he didn’t. He appreciated that 29 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) GORSUCH , J., concurring stare decisis is not a rule of “if I thought it yesterday, I must think it tomorrow.” And rather than cling to the pride of personal precedent, the Justi ce began to express doubts over the very project that he had worked to build. See Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U.S. 92, 109–110 (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment); cf. Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center , 568 U.S. 597, 617–618, 621 (2013) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). If Chevron ’s ascent is a testament to the Justice’s ingenuity, its demise is an even greater tribute to his humility.6 Justice Scalia was not alone in his reconsideration. After years spent laboring under Chevron , trying to make sense of it and make it work, Member after Member of this Court came to question the project. See, e.g., Pereira v. Sessions , 585 U.S. 198, 219–221 (2018) (Kennedy, J., concurring); Michigan v. EPA , 576 U.S. 743, 760–764 (2015) (T HOMAS , J., concurring); Kisor , 588 U.S., at 591 (R OBERTS , C.J., con- curring in part); Gutierrez-Brizuela, 834 F. 3d, at 1153; Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–15); Ka- vanaugh 2150–2154. Ultimately, the Court gave up. De- spite repeated invitations, it has not applied Chevron def- erence since 2016. Relentless Tr. 81; App. to Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, p. 68a. So an experiment thatbegan only in the mid-1980s effectively ended eight years ago. Along the way, an unusually large number of federal appellate judges voiced their own thoughtful and extensive —————— 6It should be recalled that, wh en Justice Scalia launched the Chevron revolution, there were many judges who “abhor[red] . . . ‘plain meaning’ ” and preferred instead to elevate “leg islative history” and their own cu- rated accounts of a law’s “purpose[s]” over enacted statutory text. Scalia 515, 521. Chevron , he predicted, would prov ide a new guardrail against that practice. Scalia 515, 521 . As the Justice’s later writings show, he had the right diagnosis, just the wron g cure. The answer for judges elid- ing statutory terms is not deference to agencies that may seek to do the same, but a demand that all return to a more faithful adherence to the written law. That was, of course, an other project Justic e Scalia champi- oned. And as we like to say, “we’re all textualists now.” 30 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring criticisms of Chevron . Buffington , 598 U.S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–15) (collecting examples). A number of state courts did, too, refusing to import Chevron deference into their own administrative law jurisprudence. See 598 U.S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Even if all that and everything else laid out above is true, the government suggests we should retain Chevron defer- ence because judges simply cannot live without it; some statutes are just too “technical” for courts to interpret “in - telligently.” Post, at 9, 32 (dissenting opinion). But that objection is no answer to Chevron ’s inconsistency with Con - gress’s directions in the APA, so much surrounding law, or the challenges its multistep regime have posed in practice. Nor does history counsel such defeatism. Surely, it would be a mistake to suggest our predecessors before Chevron ’s rise in the mid-1980s were unable to make their way intel-ligently through technical stat utory disputes. Following their lead, over the past eight years this Court has managed to resolve even highly complex cases without Chevron def- erence, and done so even when the government sought def-erence. Nor, as far as I am aware, did any Member of the Court suggest Chevron deference was necessary to an intel - ligent resolution of any of those matters. 7 If anything, by affording Chevron deference a period of repose before ad- dressing whether it should be retained, the Court has ena- bled its Members to test the propriety of that precedent and reflect more deeply on how well it fits into the broader ar- chitecture of our law. Others may see things differently, see post, at 26–27 (dissenting opinion), but the caution the —————— 7See, e.g., Becerra v. Empire Health Foundation, for Valley Hospital Medical Center , 597 U.S. 424, 434 (2022) (resolving intricate Medicare dispute by reference solely to “text,” “context,” and “structure”); see also Sackett v. EPA , 598 U.S. 651 (2023) (same in a complex Clean Water Act dispute); Johnson v.

None of this, of course, discharges any Member of this Court from the task of deciding for himself or herself today whether Chevron deference itself warrants deference. But when so many past and current judicial colleagues in this Court and across the country tell us our doctrine is mis- guided, and when we ourselves managed without Chevron for centuries and manage to do so today, the humility at the core of stare decisis compels us to pause and reflect carefully on the wisdom embodied in that experience. And, in the end, to my mind the lessons of experience counsel wisely against continued reliance on Chevron’s stray and uncon - sidered digression. This Court’s opinions fill over 500 vol-umes, and perhaps “some printed judicial word may be found to support almost any plausible proposition.” R.Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare Decisis, 30 A.B. A.J. 334 (1944). It is not for us to pick and choose passages we happen to like and demand total obedience to them in per- petuity. That would turn stare decisis from a doctrine of humility into a tool for judicial opportunism. Brown , 596 U.S., at 141. III Proper respect for precedent helps “keep the scale of jus- tice even and steady,” by reinforcing decisional rules con- sistent with the law upon which all can rely. 1 Blackstone 69. But that respect does not require, nor does it readily tolerate, a steadfast refusal to correct mistakes. As early as 1810, this Court had already overruled one of its cases.See Hudson v. Guestier, 6 Cranch 281, 284 (overruling Rose v. Himely , 4 Cranch 241 (1808)). In recent years, the Court may have overruled precedents less frequently than it did during the Warren and Burger Courts. See Part I–C, supra . 32 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring But the job of reconsidering past decisions remains one every Member of this Court faces from time to time. 8 Justice William O.Douglas served longer on this Court than any other person in the Nation’s history. During histenure, he observed how a new colleague might be inclined initially to “revere” every word written in an opinion issued before he arrived. W.Douglas, Stare Decisis, 49 Colum. L.Rev. 735, 736 (1949). But, over time, Justice Douglas re-flected, his new colleague would “remembe[r] . . . that it is the Constitution which he swore to support and defend, not the gloss which his predecessors may have put on it.” Ibid. And “[s]o he [would] com[e] to formulate his own views, re-jecting some earlier ones as false and embracing others.” Ibid. This process of reexamination, Justice Douglas ex- plained, is a “necessary consequence of our system” in which each judge takes an oath—both “personal” and bind- ing—to discern the law’s meaning for himself and apply it faithfully in the cases that come before him. Id., at 736– 737. Justice Douglas saw, too, how appeals to precedent could be overstated and sometimes ev en overwrought. Judges, he reflected, would sometimes fi rst issue “new and startling decision[s],” and then later spin around and “acquire anacute conservatism” in their aggressive defense of “their —————— 8Today’s dissenters are no exceptions.

In that way, even the most novel and unlikely decisions became “coveted anchor- age[s],” defended heatedly, if ironically, under the banner of “stare decisis .” Ibid.; see also Edwards v. Vannoy , 593 U.S. 255, 294, n. 7 (2021) (G ORSUCH , J., concurring). That is Chevron ’s story: A revolution masquerading as the status quo. And the defense of it follows the same course Justice Douglas described. Though our dissenting colleagues have not hesitated to question other precedents in the past, they today manifest what Justice Douglas called an “acute conservatism” for Chevron ’s “startling” de - velopment, insisting that if this “coveted anchorage” is abandoned the heavens will fall. But the Nation managed to live with busy executive agencies of all sorts long before the Chevron revolution began to take shape in the mid- 1980s. And all today’s decision means is that, going for-ward, federal courts will do exactly as this Court has since 2016, exactly as it did before the mid-1980s, and exactly as it had done since the founding: resolve cases and controver- sies without any systemic bias in the government’s favor. Proper respect for preceden t does not begin to suggest otherwise. Instead, it counsels respect for the written law, adherence to consistent teachings over aberrations, and re- sistance to the temptation of treating our own stray re - marks as if they were statutes. And each of those lessons points toward the same conclusion today: Chevron defer- ence is inconsistent with the directions Congress gave us inthe APA.It represents a grave anomaly when viewed against the sweep of historic judicial practice. The decision undermines core rule-of-law values ranging from the prom - ise of fair notice to the promise of a fair hearing. Even on its own terms, it has proved unworkable and operated to undermine rather than advance reliance interests, often to the detriment of ordinary Americans. And from the start, the whole project has relied on the overaggressive use of snippets and stray remarks fr om an opinion that carried 34 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO GORSUCH , J., concurring mixed messages. Stare decisis ’s true lesson today is not that we are bound to respect Chevron ’s “startling develop- ment,” but bound to inter it. _________________ _________________ 1 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Nos. 22–451 and 22–1219 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES, ET AL ., PETITIONERS 22–451 v.

For 40 years, Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984), has served as a cornerstone of administrative law, allocating responsibility for statutory construction betw een courts and agencies. Under Chevron , a court uses all its normal interpretive tools to determine whether Congress has spoken to an is- sue.

RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting Congress has left an ambiguity or gap, then a choice must be made. Who should give content to a statute when Con - gress’s instructions have run out? Should it be a court? Or should it be the agency Congress has charged with admin - istering the statute? The answer Chevron gives is that it should usually be the agency, within the bounds of reason- ableness. That rule has formed the backdrop against which Congress, courts, and agencies—as well as regulated par - ties and the public—all have operated for decades. It has been applied in thousands of judicial decisions. It has be - come part of the warp and woof of modern government, sup-porting regulatory efforts of all kinds—to name a few, keep- ing air and water clean, food and drugs safe, and financial markets honest. And the rule is right. Th is Court has long understood Chevron deference to reflect w hat Congress would want, and so to be rooted in a pres umption of legislative intent. Congress knows that it does not—in fact cannot—write per-fectly complete regulatory statutes. It knows that those statutes will inevitably contai n ambiguities that some other actor will have to resolve, and gaps that some other actor will have to fill. And it would usually prefer that actor to be the responsible agency, not a court. Some interpretiveissues arising in the regulatory context involve scientific or technical subject matter. Agencies have expertise in those areas; courts do not. Some demand a detailed understand- ing of complex and interdependent regulatory programs. Agencies know those programs inside-out; again, courts do not. And some present policy choices, including trade-offs between competing goods. Agencies report to a President,who in turn answers to the public for his policy calls; courts have no such accountability and no proper basis for making policy. And of course Congress has conferred on that ex-pert, experienced, and politically accountable agency the authority to administer—to make rules about and other- wise implement—the statute giving rise to the ambiguity or 3 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting gap. Put all that together and deference to the agency is the almost obvious choice, based on an implicit congres- sional delegation of interpreti ve authority. We defer, the Court has explained, “because of a presumption that Con- gress” would have “desired the agency (rather than the courts)” to exercise “whatever degree of discretion” the stat- ute allows. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 740–741 (1996). Today, the Court flips the script: It is now “the courts (ra- ther than the agency)” that will wield power when Congress has left an area of interpretive discretion. A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris. In recent years, this Court has too often taken for itself decision-mak-ing authority Congress assigned to agencies. The Court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; its own judgment on climate change for that of the Environ- mental Protection Agency; and its own judgment on student loans for that of the Department of Education. See, e.g., National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA , 595 U.S. 109 (2022); West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697 (2022); Biden v. Nebraska , 600 U.S. 477 (2023). But evidently that was, for this Court, all too piecemeal. In one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself exclusive power over every open issue—no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden—in-volving the meaning of regulatory law. As if it did not have enough on its plate, the majority turns itself into the coun - try’s administrative czar. It defends that move as one (sud-denly) required by the (nearl y 80-year-old) Administrative Procedure Act. But the Act makes no such demand. To - day’s decision is not one Congress directed. It is entirely the majority’s choice. And the majority cannot des troy one doctrine of judicial humility without making a laughing-stock of a second. (If opinions had titles, a good candidate for today’s would beHubris Squared.) Stare decisis is, among other things, a 4 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting way to remind judges that wisdom often lies in what prior judges have done. It is a brake on the urge to convert “every new judge’s opinion” into a new legal rule or regime. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization , 597 U.S. 215, 388 (2022) (joint opinion of Breyer, S OTOMAYOR , and KAGAN , JJ., dissenting) (quoting 1 W.Blackstone, Com - mentaries on the Laws of England 69 (7th ed. 1775)). Chev - ron is entrenched precedent, entitled to the protection of stare decisis , as even the majority acknowledges. In fact, Chevron is entitled to the supercharged version of that doc- trine because Congress could al ways overrule the decision, and because so many governme ntal and private actors have relied on it for so long. Because that is so, the majority needs a “particularly special justification” for its action. Ki- sor v. Wilkie , 588 U.S. 558, 588 (2019) (opinion of the Court). But the majority has nothing that would qualify. It barely tries to advance the usual factors this Court invokes for overruling precedent. Its justification comes down, in the end, to this: Courts must have more say over regula- tion—over the provision of health care, the protection of the environment, the safety of consumer products, the efficacyof transportation systems, and so on. A longstanding prec - edent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority. The major-ity disdains restraint, and grasps for power. I Begin with the problem that gave rise to Chevron (and also to its older precursors): The regulatory statutes Con - gress passes often contain ambiguities and gaps. Some-times they are intentional. Perhaps Congress “consciously desired” the administering agen cy to fill in aspects of the legislative scheme, believing that regulatory experts wouldbe “in a better position” than legislators to do so. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 865. Or “perhaps Congress was unable to forge a coalition on either side” of a question, and the contending 5 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting parties “decided to take their chances with” the agency’s resolution. Ibid. Sometimes, though, the gaps or ambigui- ties are what might be thought of as predictable accidents. They may be the result of sloppy drafting, a not infrequent legislative occurrence. Or they may arise from the well- known limits of language or foresight. Accord, ante, at 7, 22. “The subject matter” of a statutory provision may be too “specialized and varying” to “capture in its every detail.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 566 (plurality opinion). Or the provision may give rise, years or decades down the road, to an issue the enacting Congress could not have anticipated. Which- ever the case—whatever the reas on—the result is to create uncertainty about some aspect of a provision’s meaning. Consider a few examples from the caselaw. They will help show what a typical Chevron question looks like—or really, what a typical Chevron question is. Because when choosing whether to send some class of questions mainly to a court, or mainly to an agency, abstract analysis can only go so far; indeed, it may obscure what matters most. So I begin with the concrete: Under the Public Health Service Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates “biological prod- uct[s],” including “protein[s].” 42 U.S. C. §262(i)(1). When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as such a “protein”? Must it have a specific, defined se- quence of amino acids? See Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. FDA , 514 F.Supp. 3d 66, 79–80, 93–106 (DC 2020). Under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wild- life Service must designate en dangered “vertebrate fish or wildlife” species, including “distinct population seg- ment[s]” of those species. 16 U.S. C. §1532(16); see §1533. What makes one population segment “distinct” from another? Must the Service treat the Washington State population of western gray squirrels as “distinct” 6 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting because it is geographically separated from other west- ern gray squirrels? Or can the Service take into ac-count that the genetic makeup of the Washington pop-ulation does not differ markedly from the rest? See Northwest Ecosystem Alliance v. United States Fish and Wildlife Serv. , 475 F. 1136, 1140–1145, 1149 (CA9 2007). Under the Medicare program, reimbursements to hos-pitals are adjusted to reflect “differences in hospital wage levels” across “geographic area[s].” 42 U.S. C. §1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i). How should the Department ofHealth and Human Services measure a “geographic area”? By city? By county? By metropolitan area? See Bellevue Hospital Center v. Leavitt , 443 F. 163, 174– 176 (CA2 2006). Congress directed the Department of the Interior and the Federal Aviation Admini stration to reduce noise from aircraft flying over Grand Canyon National Park—specifically, to “provi de for substantial restora- tion of the natural quiet.” §3(b)(1), 101 Stat. 676; see §3(b)(2). How much noise is consistent with “the natu-ral quiet”? And how much of the park, for how manyhours a day, must be that quiet for the “substantial res - toration” requirement to be met? See Grand Canyon Air Tour Coalition v. FAA , 154 F. 455, 466–467, 474–475 (CADC 1998). Or take Chevron itself. In amendments to the Clean Air Act, Congress told States to require permits formodifying or constructing “s tationary sources” of air pollution. 42 U.S. C. §7502(c)(5). Does the term “sta-tionary source[ ]” refer to each pollution-emitting piece of equipment within a plant? Or does it refer to the entire plant, and thus allow escape from the permittingrequirement when increased emissions from one pieceof equipment are offset by reductions from another? See 467 U.S., at 857, 859. 7 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting In each case, a statutory phrase has more than one reason- able reading. And Congress has not chosen among them: It has not, in any real-world sense, “fixed” the “single, bestmeaning” at “the time of enactment” (to use the majority’s phrase). Ante , at 22. A question thus arises: Who decides which of the possible readings should govern? This Court has long thought that the choice should usu- ally fall to agencies, with courts broadly deferring to their judgments. For the last 40 years, that doctrine has gone by the name of Chevron deference, after the 1984 decision that formalized and canonized it. In Chevron, the Court set out a simple two-part framework fo r reviewing an agency’s in - terpretation of a statute that it administers. First, the re-viewing court must determine whether Congress has “di- rectly spoken to the precise question at issue.” 467 U.S., at 842. That inquiry is rigorous: A court must exhaust all the “traditional tools of statutory construction” to divine statu- tory meaning. Id., at 843, n. 9. And when it can find that meaning—a “single right answer”—that is “the end of the matter”: The court cannot defer be cause it “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 575 (opinion of the Court); Chevron , 467 U.S., at 842–843. But if the court, after using its whole legal toolkit, concludes that “the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” in dispute—for any of the not-uncommon reasons discussed above—then the court must cede the primary interpretive role. Ibid.; see supra, at 4–5. At that second step, the court asks only whether the agency construction is within the sphere of “reasonable” readings. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 844. If it is, the agency’s interpretation of the statute that it every day implementswill control. That rule, the Court has long explained, rests on a pre- sumption about legislative intent—about what Congresswants when a statute it has charged an agency with imple- menting contains an ambiguity or a gap. See id., at 843– 8 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting 845; Smiley , 517 U.S., at 740–741. An enacting Congress, as noted above, knows those uncertainties will arise, even if it does not know what they will turn out to be. See supra, at 4–5. And every once in a while, Congress provides an explicit instruction for dealing with that contingency—as - signing primary responsibility to the courts, or else to an agency. But much more often, Congress does not say. Thus arises the need for a presumption—really, a default rule—for what should happen in that event. Does a statutory si- lence or ambiguity then go to a court for resolution? Or to an agency? This Court has long thought Congress would choose an agency, with courts serving only as a backstop to make sure the agency makes a reasonable choice among the possible readings. Or said othe rwise, Congress would select the agency it has put in control of a regulatory scheme to exercise the “degree of discreti on” that the statute’s lack of clarity or completeness allows. Smiley , 517 U.S., at 741. Of course, Congress can always refute that presumptive choice—can say that, really, it would prefer courts to wield that discretionary power. But until then, the presumption cuts in the agency’s favor. 1 The next question is why. —————— 1Note that presumptions of this ki nd are common in the law. In other contexts, too, the Court responds to a congressional lack of direction by adopting a presumption about what Congress wants, rather than trying to figure that out in every case. And then Congress can legislate, with “predictable effects,” against that “stable background” rule. Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. , 561 U.S. 247, 261 (2010). Take the pre- sumption against extraterritoriality: The Court assumes Congress means for its statutes to apply only within the United States, absent a “clear indication” to the contrary. Id., at 255. Or the presumption against retroactivity: The Court assumes Congress wants its laws to ap - ply only prospectively, unless it “ unambiguously instruct[s]” something different. Vartelas v. Holder , 566 U.S. 257, 266 (2012). Or the presump- tion against repeal of statutes by implication: The Court assumes Con - gress does not intend a later statute to displace an earlier one unless it makes that intention “clear and manifest.” Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis , 584 U.S. 497, 510 (2018). Or the (so far unnamed) presumption against treating a procedural requirement as “jurisdict ional” unless “Congress 9 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting For one, because agencies often know things about a stat- ute’s subject matter that courts could not hope to. The point is especially stark when the statute is of a “scientific or technical nature.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 571 (plurality opin - ion). Agencies are staffed with “experts in the field” who can bring their training and knowledge to bear on open stat- utory questions. Chevron , 467 U.S., at 865. Consider, for example, the first bulleted case above. When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as a “protein”? See supra, at 5. I don’t know many judges who would feel confident resolv - ing that issue. (First question: What even is an alpha amino acid polymer?) But the FDA likely has scores of sci-entists on staff who can think intelligently about it, maybe collaborate with each other on its finer points, and arrive at a sensible answer. Or take the perhaps more accessible-sounding second case, involving the Endangered Species Act. See supra, at 5–6. Deciding when one squirrel popu- lation is “distinct” from another (and thus warrants protec - tion) requires knowing about species more than it does con- sulting a dictionary. How much variation of what kind— geographic, genetic, morpholo gical, or behavioral—should be required? A court could, if forced to, muddle throughthat issue and announce a result. But wouldn’t the Fish and Wildlife Service, with all its specialized expertise, do a better job of the task—of saying what, in the context of spe- cies protection, the open-ended term “distinct” means? One idea behind the Chevron presumption is that Congress— —————— clearly states that it is.” Boechler v. Commissioner , 596 U.S. 199, 203 (2022). I could continue, except that this footnote is long enough. The Chevron deference rule is to the same effect: The Court generally as - sumes that Congress intends to confer discretion on agencies to handle statutory ambiguities or gaps, absent a direction to the contrary. The majority calls that presumption a “fiction,” ante, at 26, but it is no more so than any of the presumptions listed above. They all are best guesses—and usually quite good guesses—by courts about congressional intent. 10 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting the same Congress that charged the Service with imple- menting the Act—would answer that question with a re - sounding “yes.” A second idea is that Congress would value the agency’s experience with how a comple x regulatory regime func- tions, and with what is needed to make it effective. Let’s stick with squirrels for a mome nt, except broaden the lens. In construing a term like “distinct” in a case about squir - rels, the Service likely would benefit from its “historical fa-miliarity” with how the term has covered the population segments of other species. Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n , 499 U.S. 144, 153 (1991); see, e.g., Center for Biological Diversity v. Zinke , 900 F. 1053, 1060–1062 (CA9 2018) (arctic grayling); Center for Biologi - cal Diversity v. Zinke , 868 F. 1054, 1056 (CA9 2017) (de- sert eagle). Just as a common- law court makes better deci- sions as it sees multiple variations on a theme, an agency’s construction of a statutory term benefits from its unique ex- posure to all the related ways the term comes into play. Or consider, for another way regu latory familiarity matters, the example about adjusting Medicare reimbursement for geographic wage differences. See supra, at 6. According to a dictionary, the term “geographic area” could be as largeas a multi-state region or as small as a census tract. How to choose? It would make sense to gather hard information about what reimbursement levels each approach will pro- duce, to explore the ease of administering each on a nation-wide basis, to survey how regu lators have dealt with simi- lar questions in the past, and to confer with the hospitals themselves about what makes sense. See Kisor , 588 U.S., at 571 (plurality opinion) (noting that agencies are able to“conduct factual investigations” and “consult with affectedparties”). Congress knows the Department of Health and Human Services can do all those things—and that courts cannot. Still more, Chevron ’s presumption reflects that resolving 11 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting statutory ambiguities, as Congress well knows, is “often more a question of policy than of law.” Pauley v. BethEn - ergy Mines, Inc. , 501 U.S. 680, 696 (1991). The task is less one of construing a text than of balancing competing goals and values. Consider the statutory directive to achieve“substantial restoration of the [Grand Canyon’s] natural quiet.” See supra, at 6. Someone is go ing to have to decide exactly what that statute means for air traffic over the can-yon. How many flights, in what places and at what times, are consistent with restoring enough natural quiet on theground? That is a policy trade-o ff of a kind familiar to agen - cies—but peculiarly unsuited to judges. Or consider Chev - ron itself. As the Court there understood, the choice be - tween defining a “stationary source” as a whole plant or asa pollution-emitting device is a choice about how to “recon- cile” two “manifestly competing interests.” 467 U.S., at 865. The plantwide definition relaxes the permitting re- quirement in the interest of promoting economic growth; the device-specific definition strengthens that requirement to better reduce air pollution. See id., at 851, 863, 866. Again, that is a choice a judge should not be making, but one an agency properly can. Agencies are “subject to thesupervision of the President, who in turn answers to the public.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 571–572 (plurality opinion). So when faced with a statutory ambiguity, “an agency to whichCongress has delegated policymaking responsibilities” may rely on an accountable actor’s “views of wise policy to informits judgments.” Chevron , 467 U.S., at 865. None of this is to say that deference to agencies is always appropriate. The Court over time has fine-tuned the Chev- ron regime to deny deference in classes of cases in which Congress has no reason to prefer an agency to a court. The majority treats those “refinements” as a flaw in the scheme, ante, at 27, but they are anything but. Consider the rule that an agency gets no deference when construing a statuteit is not responsible for administering. See Epic Systems 12 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting Corp. v. Lewis , 584 U.S. 497, 519–520 (2018). Well, of course not—if Congress has not put an agency in charge of implementing a statute, Congress would not have given the agency a special role in its construction. Or take the rule that an agency will not receive deference if it has reached its decision without using—or without using properly—itsrulemaking or adjudicatory authority. See United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218, 226–227 (2001); Encino Motor - cars, LLC v. Navarro , 579 U.S. 211, 220 (2016). Again, that should not be surprising: Congress expects that authorita- tive pronouncements on a law’s meaning will come from the procedures it has enacted to foster “fairness and delibera- tion” in agency decision-making. Mead , 533 U.S., at 230. Or finally, think of the “extraordinary cases” involvingquestions of vast “economic and political significance” in which the Court has declined to defer. King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485–486 (2015). The theory is that Congress would not have left matters of such import to an agency, butwould instead have insisted on maintaining control. So the Chevron refinements proceed from the same place as the original doctrine. Taken togeth er, they give interpretive primacy to the agency when—but only when—it is acting,as Congress specified, in the heartland of its delegated au- thority. That carefully calibrated framework “reflects a sensitiv- ity to the proper roles of the political and judicial branches.” Pauley , 501 U.S., at 696. Where Congress has spoken, Con- gress has spoken; only its judgments matter. And courts alone determine when that has happened: Using all theirnormal interpretive tools, th ey decide whether Congress has addressed a given issue. But when courts have decided that Congress has not done so, a choice arises. Absent a legislative directive, either the administering agency or a court must take the lead. And the matter is more fit for the agency. The decision is likely to involve the agency’s sub-ject-matter expertise; to fall with in its sphere of regulatory 13 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting experience; and to involve poli cy choices, including cost- benefit assessments and trade-offs between conflicting val - ues. So a court without relevant expertise or experience, and without warrant to make policy calls, appropriately steps back. The court still has a role to play: It polices the agency to ensure that it acts within the zone of reasonable options. But the court does not insert itself into an agency’s expertise-driven, policy-laden functions. That is the ar-rangement best suited to keep ev ery actor in its proper lane. And it is the one best suited to ensure that Congress’s stat- utes work in the way Congress intended. The majority makes two points in reply, neither convinc - ing. First, it insists that “agencies have no special compe-tence” in filling gaps or resolving ambiguities in regulatory statutes; rather, “[c]ourts do.” Ante , at 23. Score one for self-confidence; maybe not so high for self-reflection or -knowledge. Of course courts often construe legal texts, hopefully well. And Chevron ’s first step takes full ad- vantage of that talent: There, a court tries to divine whatCongress meant, even in the most complicated or abstruse statutory schemes. The deference comes in only if the court cannot do so—if the court must admit that standard legal tools will not avail to fill a stat utory silence or give content to an ambiguous term. That is when the issues look like the ones I started off with: When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as a “protein”? How distinct is “distinct” for squirrel populations? What size “geographic area” will ensure appropriate hospital reimbursement? As between two equally feasible understand ings of “stationary source,” should one choose the one more protective of the environ-ment or the one more favorable to economic growth? The idea that courts have “special competence” in deciding such questions whereas agencies have “no[ne]” is, if I may say,malarkey. Answering those questions right does not mainly demand the interpretive skills courts possess. In - stead, it demands one or more of: subject-matter expertise, 14 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting long engagement with a regulatory scheme, and policy choice. It is courts (not agen cies) that “have no special com- petence”—or even legitimacy—when those are the things a decision calls for. Second, the majority complains that an ambiguity or gap does not “necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency” should have primary interpretive authority. Ante , at 22. On that score, I’ll agr ee with the premise: It doesn’t “necessarily” do so. Chevron is built on a presumption. The decision does not maintain that Congress in every case wants the agency, rather than a court, to fill in gaps. The decision maintains that when Congress does not expressly pick one or the other, we need a default rule; and the best default rule—agency or court?—is the one we think Con- gress would generally want. As to why Congress would gen- erally want the agency: The ans wer lies in everything said above about Congress’s delegati on of regulatory power to the agency and the agency’s special competencies. See su- pra, at 9–11. The majority appears to think it is a show- stopping rejoinder to note that many statutory gaps and ambiguities are “unintentional.” Ante , at 22. But to begin, many are not; the ratio between the two is uncertain. See supra, at 4–5. And to end, why should that matter in any event? Congress may not have deliberately introduced a gap or ambiguity into the statute; but it knows that pretty much everything it drafts will someday be found to contain such a “flaw.” Given that knowledge, Chevron asks, what would Congress want? The presumed answer is again thesame (for the same reasons): The agency. And as with any default rule, if Congress decides otherwise, all it need do is say. In that respect, the proof really is in the pudding: Con - gress basically never says otherwise, suggesting that Chev - ron chose the presumption aligning with legislative intent (or, in the majority’s words, “approximat[ing] reality,” ante, at 22). Over the last four decades, Congress has authorized 15 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting or reauthorized hundreds of statutes. The drafters of those statutes knew all about Chevron . See A.Gluck & L.Bress- man, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside—An Empir - ical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation, and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L.Rev. 901, 928 (fig. 2), 994 (2013). So if they had wanted a different assignment of interpretive responsibility, they would have inserted a provision to that effect. With just a pair of exceptions I know of, they did not. See 12 U.S. C. §25b(b)(5)(A) (exception #1); 15 U.S. C. §8302(c)(3)(A) (exception #2). Similarly, Congress has de- clined to enact proposed legislation that would abolish Chevron across the board. See S. 909, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., §2 (2019) (still a bill, not a law); H.R. 5, 115th Cong., 1st Sess., §202 (2017) (same). So to the extent the majority is worried that the Chevron presumption is “fiction[al],” ante, at 26—as all legal presumptions in some sense are— it has gotten less and less so every day for 40 years. The congressional reaction shows as well as anything could that the Chevron Court read Congress right. II The majority’s principal arguments are in a different vein. Around 80 years after the APA was enacted and 40years after Chevron , the majority has decided that the for- mer precludes the latter. The APA’s Section 706, the ma - jority says, “makes clear” that agency interpretations of statutes “are not entitled to deference.” Ante , at 14–15 (em - phasis in original). And that provision, the majority contin- ues, codified the contemporaneous law, which likewise did not allow for deference. See ante, at 9–13, 15–16. But nei- ther the APA nor the pre-APA state of the law does the work that the majority claims. Both are perfectly compatible with Chevron deference. Section 706, enacted with the rest of the APA in 1946, provides for judicial review of agency action. It states: “To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the 16 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and de- termine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.” 5 U.S. C. §706. That text, contra the majority, “does not resolve the Chev- ron question.” C.Sunstein, Chevron As Law, 107 Geo. L.J. 1613, 1642 (2019) (Sunstein). Or said a bit differently, Sec-tion 706 is “generally indeterminate” on the matter of def-erence. A.Vermeule, Judgi ng Under Uncertainty 207 (2006) (Vermeule). The majority highlights the phrase “de-cide all relevant questions of law” (italicizing the “all”), and notes that the provision “prescribes no deferential stand- ard” for answering those questions. Ante , at 14. But just as the provision does not prescribe a deferential standard of review, so too it does not prescribe a de novo standard of review (in which the court starts from scratch, without giv- ing deference). In point of fact, Section 706 does not specify any standard of review for construing statutes. See Kisor , 588 U.S., at 581 (plurality opinion). And when a court uses a deferential standard—here, by deciding whether an agency reading is reasonable—it just as much “decide[s]” a “relevant question[ ] of law” as when it uses a de novo stand- ard. §706. The deferring co urt then conforms to Section 706 “by determining whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its assigned discretion—that is, whether the agency has construed [the statute it administers] reasona- bly.” J.Manning, Chevron and the Reasonable Legislator, 128 Harv. L.Rev. 457, 459 (2014); see Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 317 (2013) (R OBERTS , C.J., dissenting) (“We do not ignore [Section 706’s] command when we afford an agency’s statutory interpretation Chevron deference; we re- spect it”).2 —————— 2The majority tries to buttress its ar gument with a stray sentence or two from the APA’s legislative history, but the same response holds. As the majority notes, see ante, at 15, the House and Senate Reports each stated that Section 706 “provid[ed] that questions of law are for courts 17 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting Section 706’s references to standards of review in other contexts only further undercut the majority’s argument. The majority notes that Secti on 706 requires deferential re- view for agency fact-finding and policy-making (under, re- spectively, a substantial-evidence standard and an arbi- trary-and-capricious standard). See ante, at 14. Congress, the majority claims, “surely would have articulated a simi - larly deferential standard applicable to questions of law had it intended to depart” from de novo review. Ibid. Surely? In another part of Section 706, Congress explicitly referred to de novo review. §706(2)(F). With all those ref - erences to standards of review—both deferential and not— running around Section 706, what is “telling” ( ante, at 14) is the absence of any standard for reviewing an agency’s statutory constructions. That silence left the matter, as noted above, “generally indeterminate”: Section 706 neither mandates nor forbids Chevron -style deference. Vermeule 207. 3 —————— rather than agencies to decide in the last analysis.” H.R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946); S.Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 28(1945). But that statement also does not address the standard of review that courts should then use. When a court defers under Chevron , it re - views the agency’s construction for re asonableness “in the last analysis.” The views of Representative Walter, which the majority also cites, fur- ther demonstrate my point. He stat ed that the APA would require courts to “determine independently all releva nt questions of law,” but he also stated that courts would be required to “exercise . . . independent judg- ment” in applying the substantial-evidence standard (a deferential standard if ever there were one). 92 Cong. Rec. 5654 (1946). He therefore did not equate “independent” review with de novo review; he thought that a court could conduct independent review of agency action using a deferential standard. 3In a footnote responding to the last two paragraphs, the majority raises the white flag on Section 706’s text. See ante, at 15, n. 4. Yes, it finally concedes, Section 706 does not say that de novo review is required for an agency’s statutory construction. Rather, the majority says, “some things go without saying,” and de novo review is such a thing. See ibid. But why? What extra-textual considerations force us to read Section 706 the majority’s way? In its footnote, th e majority repairs only to history. 18 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting And contra the majority, most “respected commentators” understood Section 706 in that way—as allowing, even if not requiring, deference. Ante , at 16. The finest adminis- trative law scholars of the time (call them that generation’s Manning, Sunstein, and Vermeule) certainly did. Professor Louis Jaffe described something very like the Chevron two- step as the preferred method of reviewing agency interpre-tations under the APA.A court, he said, first “must decide as a ‘question of law’ whether there is ‘discretion’ in the premises.” Judicial Control of Administrative Action 570 (1965). That is akin to step 1: Did Congress speak to the issue, or did it leave openness? And if the latter, Jaffe con- tinued, the agency’s view “if ‘reasonable’ is free of control.” Ibid. That of course looks like step 2: defer if reasonable. And just in case that description was too complicated, Jaffe conveyed his main point this way: The argument that courts “must decide all questions of law”—as if there were no agency in the picture—“is, in my opinion, unsound.” Id., at 569. Similarly, Professor Kenneth Culp Davis, author ofthe then-preeminent treatise on administrative law, noted with approval that “reasonableness” review of agency inter- pretations—in which courts “refused to substitute judg- ment”—had “survived the APA.” Administrative Law 880, 883, 885 (1951) (Davis). Other contemporaneous scholars and experts agreed. See R.Levin, The APA and the Assault on Deference, 106 Minn. L.Rev. 125, 181–183 (2021) (Levin) (listing many of them). They did not see in their own time what the majority finds there today. 4 —————— But as I will explain below, the majori ty also gets wrong the most rele- vant history, pertaining to how judicial review of agency interpretations operated in the years before the APA was enacted. See infra, at 19–23. 4I concede one exception (whose view was “almost completely isolated,” Levin 181), but his comments on Section 706 refute a different aspect ofthe majority’s argument. Professor John Dickinson, as the majority notes, thought that Section 706 precluded courts from deferring to agency interpretations. See Admini strative Procedure Act: Scope and Grounds of Broadened Judicial Review, 33 A.B. A.J. 434, 516 (1947) 19 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting Nor, evidently, did the Supreme Court. In the years after the APA was enacted, the Court “never indicated that sec- tion 706 rejected the idea that courts might defer to agency interpretations of law.” Sunstein 1654. Indeed, not a single Justice so much as floated that view of the APA.To the contrary, the Court issued a number of decisions in those years deferring to an agency’s statutory interpretation. See, e.g., Unemployment Compensation Comm’n of Alaska v. Aragon , 329 U.S. 143, 153–154 (1946); NLRB v. E.C. Atkins & Co. , 331 U.S. 398, 403 (1947); Cardillo v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. , 330 U.S. 469, 478–479 (1947). And that con- tinued right up until Chevron . See, e.g. , Mitchell v. Budd, 350 U.S. 473, 480 (1956); Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, 437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978). To be clear: Deference in those years was not always gi ven to interpretations that would receive it under Chevron . The practice then was more inconsistent and less fully elaborated than it later be- came. The point here is only that the Court came nowhere close to accepting the majority’s view of the APA.Take the language from Section 706 that the majority most relies on: “decide all relevant questions of law.” See ante, at 14. In the decade after the APA’s e nactment, those words were used only four times in Suprem e Court opinions (all in foot- notes)—and never to suggest that courts could not defer to agency interpretations. See Sunstein 1656. The majority’s view of Section 706 likewise gets no sup- port from how judicial review operated in the years leading up to the APA.That prior hi story matters: As the majority recognizes, Section 706 was generally understood to “re- state[ ] the present law as to the scope of judicial review.” —————— (Dickinson); ante, at 16. But unlike the majority, he viewed that bar as “a change” to, not a restatement of, pre-APA law. Compare Dickinson 516 with ante, at 15–16. So if the majority really wants to rely on Pro- fessor Dickinson, it will have to give up the claim, which I address below, that the law before the APA forbade deference. See infra , at 19–23. 20 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting Dept. of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the Admin- istrative Procedure Act 108 (1947); ante , at 15–16. The problem for the majority is that in the years preceding the APA, courts became ever more deferential to agencies. New Deal administrative programs had by that point come intotheir own. And this Court and others, in a fairly short time, had abandoned their initial resistance and gotten on board. Justice Breyer, wearing his administrative-law-scholar hat,characterized the pre-APA period this way: “[J]udicial re- view of administrative action was curtailed, and particular agency decisions were frequent ly sustained with judicial obeisance to the mysteries of administrative expertise.” S.Breyer et al., Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 21 (7th ed. 2011). And that description extends to review of an agency’s statutory constructions. An influential study of administrative practice, pub lished five years before the APA’s enactment, described the state of play: Judicial “re-view may, in some instances at least, be limited to the in - quiry whether the administrative construction is a permis- sible one.” Final Report of Attorney General’s Committee on Administrative Procedure (1941), reprinted in Adminis- trative Procedure in Government Agencies, S.Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 78 (1941). Or again: “[W]here thestatute is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpre- tation, the court may accept that of the administrative body.” Id., at 90–91. 5 —————— 5Because the APA was meant to “restate[ ] the present law,” the judi- cial review practices of the 1940s are more important to understanding the statute than is any earlier tradition (such as the majority dwells on). But before I expand on those APA-co ntemporaneous practices, I pause to note that they were “not built on sand.” Kisor v. Wilkie , 588 U.S. 558, 568–569 (2019) (plurality opinion). Si nce the early days of the Republic, this Court has given significant weight to official interpretations of “am- biguous law[s].” Edwards’ Lessee v. Darby , 12 Wheat. 206, 210 (1827). With the passage of time—and the gr owth of the administrative sphere— those “judicial expressions of deference increased.” H.Monaghan, Mar- bury and the Administrative State, 83 Co lum. L.Rev. 1, 15 (1983). By 21 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting Two prominent Supreme Court decisions of the 1940s put those principles into action. Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402 (1941), was then widely understood as “the leading case” on review of agency interpretations. Davis 882; see ibid. (not- ing that it “establish[ed] what is known as ‘the doctrine of Gray v. Powell’ ”). There, the Court deferred to an agency construction of the term “producer” as used in a statutory exemption from price controls. Congress, the Court ex-plained, had committed the scope of the exemption to the agency because its “experience in [the] field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable, adjustment of the con - flicting interests.” Gray , 314 U.S., at 412. Accordingly, the Court concluded that it was “not the province of a court” to “substitute its judgment” for the agency’s. Ibid. Three years later, the Court decided NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., 322 U.S. 111 (1944), another acknowledged “leading case.” Davis 882; see id., at 884. The Court again deferred, this time to an agency’s construction of the term “employee” in the National Labor Relations Act. The scope of that term, the Court explained, “belong[ed] to” the agency to an- swer based on its “[e]veryday experience in the administra- tion of the statute.” Hearst , 322 U.S., at 130. The Court therefore “limited” its review to whether the agency’s read-ing had “warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in —————— the early 20th century, the Court stated that it would afford “great weight” to an agency construction in the face of statutory “uncertainty orambiguity.” National Lead Co. v. United States , 252 U.S. 140, 145 (1920); see Schell’s Executors v. Fauché , 138 U.S. 562, 572 (1891) (“con - trolling” weight in “all cases of ambiguity”); United States v. Alabama Great Southern R.Co., 142 U.S. 615, 621 (1892) (“decisive” weight “in case of ambiguity”); Jacobs v. Prichard , 223 U.S. 200, 214 (1912) (refer - ring to the “rule which gives strength” to official interpretations if “am-biguity exist[s]”). So even before the New Deal, a strand of this Court’s cases exemplified deference to execut ive constructions of ambiguous stat- utes. And then, as I show in the te xt, the New Deal arrived and deference surged—creating the “present la w” that the APA “restated.” 22 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting law.” Id., at 131.6 Recall here that even the majority ac - cepts that Section 706 was meant to “restate[ ] the present law” as to judicial review. See ante, at 15–16; supra, at 19– 20. Well then? It sure would seem that the provision allows a deference regime. The majority has no way around those two noteworthy decisions. It first appears to distinguish between “pure le - gal question[s]” and the so-called mixed questions in Gray and Hearst , involving the application of a legal standard to a set of facts. Ante , at 11. If in drawing that distinction, the majority intends to confine its holding to the pure type of legal issue—thus enabling courts to defer when law andfacts are entwined—I’d be glad. But I suspect the majority has no such intent, because that approach would preserve Chevron in a substantial part of its current domain. Cf. Wilkinson v. Garland , 601 U.S. 209, 230 (2024) (A LITO, J., dissenting) (noting, in the immigration context, that theuniverse of mixed questions swamps that of pure legal ones). It is frequently in the consideration of mixed ques- tions that the scope of statutory terms is established and their meaning defined. See H.Monaghan, Marbury and the —————— 6The majority says that I have “pluck[ed] out” Gray and Hearst , im- pliedly from a vast number of not-so-helpful cases. Ante, at 13, n. 3. It would make as much sense to say that a judge “plucked out” Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB , 340 U.S. 474 (1951), to discuss substantial-evi- dence review or “plucked out” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29 (1983), to dis- cuss arbitrary-and-capricious review. Gray and Hearst , as noted above, were the leading cases about agency interpretations in the years before the APA’s enactment. But ju st to gild the lily, here are a number of other Supreme Court decisions from the fi ve years prior to the APA’s enact- ment that were of a piece: United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515, 536 (1946); ICC v. Parker, 326 U.S. 60, 65 (1945); Federal Security Administrator v. Quaker Oats Co., 318 U.S. 218, 227– 228 (1943). The real “pluck[ing]” offense is the majority’s—for taking a stray sentence from Hearst (ante, at 13, n. 3) to suggest that both Hearst and Gray stand for the opposite of what they actually do. 23 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting Administrative State, 83 Colum. L.Rev. 1, 29 (1983) (“Ad- ministrative application of law is administrative formula- tion of law whenever it involves elaboration of the statutory norm”). How does a statutor y interpreter decide, as in Hearst , what an “employee” is? In large part through cases asking whether the term covers people performing specific jobs, like (in that case) “newsboys.” 322 U.S., at 120. Or consider one of the examples I offered above. How does an interpreter decide when one population segment of a spe - cies is “distinct” from another? Often by considering thatrequirement with respect to particular species, like western gray squirrels. So the distinction the majority offers makes no real-world (or even theoretical) sense. If the Hearst Court was deferring to an agency on whether the term “em- ployee” covered newsboys, it wa s deferring to the agency on the scope and meaning of the term “employee.” The majority’s next rejoinder—that “the Court was far from consistent” in deferring—falls equally flat. Ante , at 12. I am perfectly ready to acknowledge that in the pre- APA period, a deference regime had not yet taken complete hold. I’ll go even further: Let’s assume that deference was then an on-again, off-again function (as the majority seems to suggest, see ante, at 11–12, and 13, n. 3). Even on that assumption, the majority’s main argument—that Section 706 prohibited deferential review—collapses. Once again, the majority agrees that Section 706 was not meant to change the then-prevailing law. See ante, at 15–16. And even if inconsistent, that law cannot possibly be thought tohave prohibited deference. Or otherwise said: “If Section 706 did not change the law of judicial review (as we havelong recognized), then it di d not proscribe a deferential standard then known and in use.” Kisor , 588 U.S., at 583 (plurality opinion). The majority’s whole argument for overturning Chevron relies on Section 706. But the text of Section 706 does not support that result. And neither does the contemporaneous 24 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting practice, which that text was supp osed to reflect. So today’s decision has no basis in the only law the majority deems relevant. It is grounded on air. III And still there is worse, because abandoning Chevron subverts every known principle of stare decisis . Of course, respecting precedent is not an “inexorable command.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S. 808, 828 (1991). But over- throwing it requires far more than the majority has offered up here. Chevron is entitled to stare decisis’s strongest form of protection. The majority thus needs an exceptionally strong reason to overturn the decision, above and beyond thinking it wrong. And it has nothing approaching such a justification, proposing only a bewildering theory about Chevron ’s “unworkability.” Ante , at 32. Just five years ago, this Court in Kisor rejected a plea to overrule Auer v. Rob- bins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), which requires judicial deference to agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations. See 588 U.S., at 586–589 (opinion of the Court). The case against overruling Chevron is at least as strong. In partic- ular, the majority’s decision today will cause a massive shock to the legal system, “cast [ing] doubt on many settled constructions” of statutes and threatening the interests of many parties who have relied on them for years. 588 U.S., at 587 (opinion of the Court). Adherence to precedent is “a foundation stone of the rule of law.” Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community , 572 U.S. 782, 798 (2014). Stare decisis “promotes the even- handed, predictable, and consistent development of legalprinciples.” Payne , 501 U.S., at 827. It enables people to order their lives in reliance on judicial decisions. And it “contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the ju- dicial process,” by ensuring th at those decisions are founded in the law, and not in the “personal preferences” of judges. Id., at 828; Dobbs , 597 U.S., at 388 (dissenting opinion). 25 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting Perhaps above all else, stare decisis is a “doctrine of judicial modesty.” Id., at 363. In that, it shares something im- portant with Chevron . Both tell judges that they do not know everything, and would do well to attend to the views of others. So today, the majority rejects what judicial hu-mility counsels not just once but twice over. And Chevron is entitled to a particularly strong form of stare decisis , for two separate reasons. First, it matters that “Congress remains free to alter what we have done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union , 491 U.S. 164, 173 (1989); see Kisor , 588 U.S., at 587 (opinion of the Court) (making the same point for Auer deference). In a constitu- tional case, the Court alone can correct an error. But that is not so here. “Our deferenc e decisions are balls tossed into Congress’s court, for acceptance or not as that branch elects.” 588 U.S., at 587–588 (opinion of the Court). And for generations now, Congress has chosen acceptance. Throughout those years, Congress could have abolished Chevron across the board, most easily by amending the APA.Or it could have eliminated deferential review in dis- crete areas, by amending old laws or drafting new laws to include an anti- Chevron provision. Instead, Congress has “spurned multiple opportunities ” to do a comprehensive re - jection of Chevron, and has hardly ever done a targeted one. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U.S. 446, 456 (2015); see supra, at 14–15. Or to put the point more af-firmatively, Congress has kept Chevron as is for 40 years. It maintained that position even as Members of this Court began to call Chevron into question. See ante, at 30. From all it appears, Congress has not agreed with the view of some Justices that they and other judges should have more power. Second, Chevron is by now much more than a single deci- sion. This Court alone, acting as Chevron allows, has up- held an agency’s reasonable interpretation of a statute at least 70 times. See Brief for United States in No. 22–1219, 26 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting p. 27; App. to id., at 68a–72a (collecting cases). Lower courts have applied the Chevron framework on thousands upon thousands of occasions. See K.Barnett & C.Walker, Chevron and Stare Decisis, 31 Geo. Mason L.Rev. 475, 477, and n. 11 (2024) (noting that at last count, Chevron was cited in more than 18,000 federal-court decisions). The Ki - sor Court observed, when upholding Auer, that “[d]eference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous rules pervades the whole corpus of administrative law.” 588 U.S., at 587 (opinion of the Court). So too does deference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous stat- utes—except more so. Chevron is as embedded as embed- ded gets in the law. The majority says differently, because this Court has ig - nored Chevron lately; all that is left of the decision is a “de- caying husk with bold pretensions.” Ante , at 33. Tell that to the D.C. Circuit, the court that reviews a large share of agency interpretations, where Chevron remains alive and well. See, e.g., Lissack v. Commissioner, 68 F. 1312, 1321–1322 (2023); Solar Energy Industries Assn. v. FERC , 59 F. 1287, 1291–1294 (2023). But more to the point: The majority’s argument is a bootstrap. This Court has “avoided deferring under Chevron since 2016” ( ante, at 32) because it has been preparing to overrule Chevron since around that time. That kind of self-help on the way to re- versing precedent has become almo st routine at this Court. Stop applying a decision where one should; “throw some gratuitous criticisms into a couple of opinions”; issue a few separate writings “question[ing the decision’s] premises” (ante , at 30); give the whole process a few years . . . and voila!—you have a justification for overruling the decision. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees , 585 U.S. 878, 950 (2018) (K AGAN , J., dissenting) (discussing the over - ruling of Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977)); see also, e.g. , Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist. , 597 U.S. 507, 571–572 (2022) (S OTOMAYOR , J., dissenting) (similar 27 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting for Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S. 602 (1971)); Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. 529, 587–588 (2013) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (similar for South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U.S. 301 (1966)). I once remarked that this overruling- through-enfeeblement technique “mock[ed] stare decisis .” Janus , 585 U.S., at 950 (dissenting opinion). I have seen no reason to change my mind. The majority does no better in its main justification for overruling Chevron —that the decision is “unworkable.” Ante , at 30. The majority’s first theory on that score is that there is no single “answer” about what “ambiguity” means: Some judges turn out to see more of it than others do, lead - ing to “different results.” Ante , at 30–31. But even if so, the legal system has for many years, in many contexts, dealt perfectly well with that va riation. Take contract law. It is hornbook stuff that when (but only when) a contract is ambiguous, a court interpreting it can consult extrinsic ev- idence. See CNH Industrial N.V. v. Reese , 583 U.S. 133, 139 (2018) (per curiam ). And when all interpretive tools still leave ambiguity, the contract is construed against the drafter. See Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U.S. 176, 186– 187 (2019). So I guess the contract rules of the 50 States are unworkable now. Or look closer to home, to doctrines this Court regularly applies. In deciding whether a govern - ment has waived sovereign immunity, we construe “[a]ny ambiguities in the statutory language” in “favor of immun-ity.” FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290 (2012). Similarly, the rule of lenity tells us to construe ambiguous statutes in favor of criminal defendants. See United States v. Cas- tleman , 572 U.S. 157, 172–173 (2014). And the canon of constitutional avoidance instructs us to construe ambigu- ous laws to avoid difficult co nstitutional questions. See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative , 532 U.S. 483, 494 (2001). I could go on, but the point is made. There are ambiguity triggers all over the law. Some - how everyone seems to get by. 28 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting And Chevron is an especially puzzling decision to criticize on the ground of generating too much judicial divergence. There’s good empirical—meaning, non-impressionistic—ev - idence on exactly that subject. And it shows that, as com- pared with de novo review, use of the Chevron two-step framework fosters agreement among judges. See K.Bar- nett, C.Boyd, & C.Walker, Ad ministrative Law’s Political Dynamics, 71 Vand. L.Rev. 1463, 1502 (2018) (Barnett). More particularly, Chevron has a “powerful constraining ef- fect on partisanship in judicial decisionmaking.” Barnett 1463 (italics deleted); see Sunstein 1672 (“[A] predictable effect of overruling Chevron would be to ensure a far greater role for judicial policy preferences in statutory interpreta - tion and far more common splits along ideological lines”). So if consistency among judges is the majority’s lodestar, then the Court should not overrule Chevron , but return to using it. The majority’s second theory on workability is likewise a makeweight. Chevron , the majority complains, has some exceptions, which (so the majority says) are “difficult” and “complicate[d]” to apply. Ante , at 32. Recall that courts are not supposed to defer when the agency construing a statute (1)has not been charged with administering that law; (2) has not used deliberative procedures— i.e., notice-and-com- ment rulemaking or adjudication; or (3) is intervening in a“major question,” of great economic and political signifi- cance. See supra, at 11–12; ante , at 27–28. As I’ve ex- plained, those exceptions—the majority also aptly callsthem “refinements”—fit with Chevron ’s rationale: They de- fine circumstances in which Congress is unlikely to have wanted agency views to govern. Ante , at 27; see supra, at 11–12. And on the difficulty scale, they are nothing much. Has Congress put the agency in charge of administering the statute? In 99 of 100 cases, everyone will agree on the an- swer with scarcely a moment’s thought. Did the agency use notice-and-comment or an adjudication before rendering an 29 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting interpretation? Once again, I could stretch my mind and think up a few edge cases, but for the most part, the answer is an easy yes or no. The major questions exception is, Iacknowledge, different: There, many judges have indeed disputed its nature and scope. Compare, e .g., West Vir- ginia , 597 U.S., at 721–724, with id., at 764–770 (K AGAN , J., dissenting). But that disagreement concerns, on every- one’s view, a tiny subset of all agency interpretations. For the most part, the exceptions t hat so upset the majority re- quire merely a rote, check-the-box inquiry. If that is the majority’s idea of a “dizzying breakdance,” ante, at 32, the majority needs to get out more. And anyway, difficult as compared to what? The major- ity’s prescribed way of proceeding is no walk in the park. First, the majority makes clear that what is usually called Skidmore deference continues to apply. See ante, at 16–17. Under that decision, agency interpretations “constitute a body of experience and informed judgment” that may be “entitled to respect.” Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944). If the majority thinks that the same judges who argue today about where “ambiguity” resides (see ante, at 30) are not going to argue tomorrow about what “respect” requires, I fear it will be gravely disappointed. Second, the majority directs courts to comply with the varied ways in which Congress in fact “delegates discretionary authority” to agencies. Ante , at 17–18. For example, Congress may authorize an agency to “define[]” or “delimit[ ]” statutory terms or concepts, or to “fill up the details” of a statutory scheme. Ante , at 17, and n. 5. Or Congress may use, in describing an agency’s regula tory authority, inherently “flexib[le]” language like “appropriate” or “reasonable.” Ante , at 17, and n. 6. Attending to every such delegation, as the majority says, is necessary in a world without Chev - ron. But that task involves complexities of its own. Indeed, one reason Justice Scalia supported Chevron was that it re- 30 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting placed such a “statute-by-statute evaluation (which was as- suredly a font of uncertainty and litigation) with an across- the-board presumption.” A.Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretation s of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 511, 516. As a lover of the predictability that rules create, Justice Scalia thought the latter “unquestionably better.” Id., at 517. On the other side of the balance, the most important stare decisis factor—call it the “jolt to the legal system” issue—weighs heavily against overruling Chevron . Dobbs , 597 U.S., at 357 (R OBERTS , C.J., concurring in judgment). Congress and agencies alike have relied on Chevron —have assumed its existence—in much of their work for the last 40 years. Statutes passed during that time reflect the ex- pectation that Chevron would allocate interpretive author- ity between agencies and courts. Rules issued during theperiod likewise presuppose that statutory ambiguities were the agencies’ to (reasonably) resolve. Those agency inter- pretations may have benefited regulated entities; or they may have protected members of the broader public. Either way, private parties have ordered their affairs—their busi- ness and financial decisions, their health-care decisions, their educational decisions—around agency actions that are suddenly now subject to challenge. In Kisor , this Court refused to overrule Auer because doing so would “cast doubt on” many longstanding constructions of rules, and thereby upset settled expectations. 588 U.S., at 587 (opinion of the Court). Overruling Chevron , and thus raising new doubts about agency constructions of statutes, will be far more dis- ruptive. The majority tries to alleviate concerns about a piece of that problem: It states that judicial decisions that have up- held agency action as reasonable under Chevron should not be overruled on that account alone. See ante, at 34–35. That is all to the good: There are thousands of such deci- sions, many settled for decades. See supra, at 26. But first, 31 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting reasonable reliance need not be predicated on a prior judi- cial decision. Some agency interpretations never chal- lenged under Chevron now will be; expectations formed around those constructions thus could be upset, in a way the majority’s assurance does not touch. And anyway, how good is that assurance, really? The majority says that a decision’s “[m]ere reliance on Chevron ” is not enough to counter the force of stare decisis ; a challenger will need an additional “special justification.” Ante , at 34. The majority is sanguine; I am not so much. Courts motivated to over - rule an old Chevron -based decision can always come up with something to label a “special justification.” Maybe a court will say “the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning” was poor. Ante , at 29. Or maybe the court will discover something “unworkable” in the decision—like some excep-tion that has to be applied. Ante , at 30. All a court need do is look to today’s opinion to see how it is done. IV Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government. — Chevron U.S. A.Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984) Those were the days, when we knew what we are not. When we knew that as between courts and agencies, Con - gress would usually think agenci es the better choice to re- solve the ambiguities and fill the gaps in regulatory stat- utes. Because agencies are “experts in the field.” And because they are part of a political branch, with a claim to making interstitial policy. And because Congress has charged them, not us, with administering the statutes con- taining the open questions. At its core, Chevron is about respecting that allocation of responsibility—the conferral of primary authority over regulato ry matters to agencies, not courts. 32 LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO KAGAN , J., dissenting Today, the majority does not respect that judgment. It gives courts the power to make all manner of scientific and technical judgments. It gives courts the power to make all manner of policy calls, including about how to weigh com - peting goods and values. (See Chevron itself.) It puts courts at the apex of the administrative process as to every con- ceivable subject—because there are always gaps and ambi- guities in regulatory statutes, and often of great import.What actions can be taken to address climate change or other environmental challenges? What will the Nation’s health-care system look like in the coming decades? Or the financial or transportation systems? What rules are going to constrain the development of A.I.? In every sphere ofcurrent or future federal regulation, expect courts from now on to play a commanding role. It is not a role Congress has given to them, in the APA or any other statute. It is a role this Court has now claimed for itself, as well as for other judges. And that claim requires disrespecting, too, this Court’s precedent. There are no special reasons, of the kind usually invoked for overturning precedent, to eliminate Chevron deference. And given Chevron ’s pervasiveness, the decision to do so is likely to produce large-scale disruption. All that backs today’s decision is the majority’s belief that Chevron was wrong—that it gave agencies too much power andcourts not enough. But shifting views about the worth of regulatory actors and their work do not justify overhauling a cornerstone of administrative law. In that sense too, to- day’s majority has lost sight of its proper role. And it is impossible to pretend that today’s decision is a one-off, in either its treatment of agencies or its treatment of precedent. As to the first, this very Term presents yet another example of the Court’s resolve to roll back agency authority, despite congressional direction to the contrary. See SEC v. Jarkesy , 603 U.S. ___ (2024); see also supra, at 3. As to the second, just my own defenses of stare decisis — 33 Cite as: 603 U.S. ____ (2024) KAGAN , J., dissenting my own dissents to this Court’s reversals of settled law—by now fill a small volume. See Dobbs, 597 U.S., at 363–364 (joint opinion of Breyer, S OTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ.); Ed- wards v. Vannoy , 593 U.S. 255, 296–297 (2021); Knick v. Township of Scott , 588 U.S. 180, 207–208 (2019); Janus , 585 U.S., at 931–932. Once again, with respect, I dissent.
