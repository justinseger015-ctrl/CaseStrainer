FILE IN CLERK’S OFFICE SUPREME COURT, STATE OF WASHINGTON MAY 29, 2025THIS OPINION WAS FILED FOR RECORD AT 8 A.M. ON MAY 29, 2025SARAH R. PENDLETON  SUPREME COURT CLERK Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc.

some  instances  without  any  protective  gear  at  all.  It  is  undisputed  that  Alcoa 

knowingly exposed its employees to asbestos, knowing that asbestos was hazardous 

and  could  lead  to  long-term  injuries.  It  was  several  decades  after  Cockrum’s 

exposures to asbestos that the disease was discovered and diagnosed because of the 

latent nature of this cancer, like other cancers and diseases. After being diagnosed 

with this form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure, Cockrum brought a personal 

injury action against Howmet Aerospace, Inc. (formerly known as Arconic Inc., a 

corporate successor to Alcoa),1 claiming his employer deliberately intended to injure 

him by exposing him to asbestos without proper warnings or protections. Based on 

Howmet’s  assertions  that  employers  are  immune  from  suit  absent  their  actual 

knowledge that injury was certain to occur, the superior court granted  Howmet’s 

motion for summary judgment and dismissed Cockrum’s suit. The Court of Appeals 

affirmed. We reverse. 

Howmet contends an employee cannot pursue such a civil action against their 

employer  for  workplace  injuries  caused  by  asbestos  exposure.  Washington’s 

Industrial  Insurance  Act  (IIA)2  generally  provides  that  workers  are  entitled  to 

compensation  without  regard  to  employer  fault,  and  employers  are  immune  from 

lawsuits arising from workplace injuries. RCW 51.04.010. That said, employers are

not  immune  from  lawsuits  if  an  “injury  results  to  a  worker  from  the  deliberate 

intention  of  [their]  employer  to  produce  such  injury.”  RCW  51.24.020.  The  trial 

court  granted  summary  judgment  to  Howmet  on  this  basis,  concluding  Cockrum 

could  not  satisfy  the  deliberate  injury  exception.  The  issue  before  this  court  is 

whether the evidence Cockrum presented creates a genuine issue of material fact that 

Alcoa had actual knowledge an injury was certain to occur. Under this court’s prior 

decision  in  Walston  v.  Boeing  Co.,  181  Wn.2d  391,  334  P.3d  519  (2014),  no 

employee could sue for a latent disease like mesothelioma because they could never 

satisfy  the  level  of  certainty  required  there;  Howmet  would  prevail  and  latent 

diseases like cancer would not be injuries any employee could sue for, regardless of 

their employer’s intent. This court does not lightly set aside precedent, but justice 

requires us to admit our mistakes when we make them and to overrule precedent that 

is demonstrably incorrect and harmful. For the reasons explained below, we now 

recognize Walston to be such a decision and must be overruled. 

We conclude that in latent disease cases, virtual certainty is sufficient to prove 

the employer’s actual knowledge that injury was certain to occur. This does not alter 

the standard of actual knowledge injury is certain to occur that is generally required 

to satisfy the deliberate injury exception for immediate and visible types of injuries; 

this virtual certainty standard is limited only to latent disease cases. We recognize 

Washington courts’ long-standing narrow reading of RCW 51.24.020 and conclude 

3 

 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

that within this narrow exception, there is room for the possibility of a tort action 

when an employer deliberately causes injury in the form of disease. We remand this 

case  to  the  trial  court  for  summary  judgment  to  be  determined  under  the  virtual 

certainty standard. 

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

A. 

Factual Background 

Cockrum was employed at Alcoa’s Wenatchee Works aluminum facility from 

1967  to  1997,  where  he  was  exposed  to  asbestos  numerous  times  throughout  his 

career. He worked in dusty areas as a laborer and recalls wearing paper masks in 

those  areas  but  does  not  recall  Alcoa  requiring  him  or  his  coworkers  to  use  any 

respiratory protection. Cockrum believes the best possibility he had of being exposed 

to asbestos was working in the facility’s environmental lab, where he tested samples 

for asbestos without any protective gear. Cockrum claims Alcoa never warned him 

about the hazardous properties of asbestos material, nor did it provide respiratory 

protection for workers in its labs. 1 Clerk’s Papers (CP) at 94, 97; 2 CP at 664-67. 

Evidence  in  the  record  reveals  that  prior  to  and  contemporaneous  with 

Cockrum’s asbestos exposures, Alcoa knew asbestos exposure was hazardous and 

that asbestos-related diseases could manifest many years after exposure. See, e.g., 

1 CP at 366 (memorandum from Alcoa (July 6, 1982) (“For a number of years, Alcoa 

has recognized the very serious potential health hazard represented by the various 

4 

 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

forms of asbestos use in our plant. Exposure to asbestos fibers can lead to asbestosis 

and various forms of cancer.”)); see also id. at 292-389; 2 CP at 731-37, 751-52, 

765-70, 774. Further, Alcoa had a medical monitoring program for its employees, 

which provided evidence that from at least 1953 onward, Alcoa’s employees were 

developing asbestos disease symptoms, such as thickened pleura, calcified pleural 

plaques,  fibrosis  in  the  lungs,  and  some  were  even  developing  asbestos-related 

diseases, such as asbestosis and early mesothelioma. Alcoa ultimately knew of the 

harms  of  asbestos  in  its  facilities  prior  to  and  contemporaneous  with  Cockrum’s 

exposures. 

Cockrum  was  diagnosed  with  mesothelioma,  a  cancer  caused  by  asbestos 

exposure, in March 2022. His doctors noted his “history of occupational asbestos 

exposure at Alcoa” as part of their diagnosis. 2 CP at 673. Cockrum’s medical expert 

opined that his mesothelioma was caused by his cumulative exposures to asbestos. 

The expert explained that latent diseases “do not result in immediate apparent injury 

upon exposure but instead do not manifest until sufficient time has lapsed. This is 

true  for  all  human  cancers.”  Id.  at  617.  However,  the  expert  also  testified  that 

asbestos-related  disease  is  never  certain  to  result  from  asbestos  exposure  or  even 

from  developing  pleural  plaques.  In  fact,  the  expert  was  “not  aware  of  any 

carcinogen  for  which  exposure  at  a  particular  dose  is  medically  certain  to  cause 

cancer in everyone.” Id. at 618 (emphasis added).

Procedural History

Cockrum  brought  a  personal  injury  suit  against  Howmet,  the  corporate 

successor  to  his  employer,  Alcoa.3  Cockrum  claimed  his  mesothelioma  was 

proximately  caused  by  asbestos  exposure  sustained  while  working  for  Alcoa.  He 

further claimed this was a deliberate injury under RCW 51.24.020 because Alcoa 

had  actual  knowledge  injury  was  certain  to  occur  from  asbestos  exposure,  yet  it 

willfully  disregarded  that  knowledge  by  continuously  exposing  him  to  asbestos 

without proper warning or protection. 

The  superior  court  granted  summary  judgment  for  Howmet,  concluding 

Cockrum could not demonstrate actual knowledge necessary to meet the deliberate 

injury exception. 3 CP at 1052-53. It reasoned that Walston precluded Cockrum’s 

lawsuit  because  the  facts  were  “materially  indistinguishable”  and  “Walston 

considered and rejected, again in material part, the plaintiffs’ theories here.” Rep. of 

Proc. at 27.  The court  declined to reach the issue of willful disregard as it found 

Cockrum’s case failed on the actual knowledge prong. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  in  an  unpublished  opinion.  Cockrum  v. 

C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc., No. 85182-9-I, slip op. at 2, 8 (Wash. Ct. App.

Feb. 12, 2024) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/851829.pdf. 

3 Cockrum also sued a number of entities that manufactured, sold, distributed, installed, 
specified,  used,  or  purchased  asbestos  products.    Howmet  is  the  only  named  defendant 
participating in this appeal.

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

It concluded the evidence demonstrated that at most, Alcoa knew of the hazards of 

asbestos, which, like in Walston, did not amount to actual knowledge that injury was 

certain to occur. The court particularly noted Cockrum’s medical expert conceding 

that asbestos-related disease is never certain to result from asbestos exposure or even 

from pleural plaques.  Like the trial court, the  Court of  Appeals  did not reach the 

willful  disregard  prong,  as  it  concluded  summary  judgment  was  proper  based  on 

Cockrum’s failure to demonstrate actual knowledge. We granted review. 

ANALYSIS 

We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Benjamin v. 

Wash.  State  Bar  Ass’n,  138  Wn.2d  506,  515,  980  P.2d  742  (1999).  Summary 

judgment  is  appropriate  when  there  is  no  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  and  the 

moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. CR 56(c). All evidence must 

be  viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  nonmoving  party.  Clements  v. 

Travelers Indem. Co., 121 Wn.2d 243, 249, 850 P.2d 1298 (1993). 

In  1911,  in  a  time  of  burgeoning  industry,  Washington  enacted  what  later 

became  the  IIA  as  the  result  of  a  “grand  compromise”  between  employers  and 

employees,  granting  injured  employees  “swift,  no-fault  compensation”  for 

on-the-job injuries and granting employers immunity from civil suits arising from 

such  injuries.  Birklid  v.  Boeing  Co.,  127  Wn.2d  853,  859,  904  P.2d  278  (1995) 

(citing  Stertz  v.  Indus.  Ins.  Comm’n,  91  Wash.  588,  590-91,  158  P.  256  (1916); 

7 

 
 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

RCW 51.04.010). Part of the compromise, however, included that “[i]f injury results 

to a worker from the deliberate intention of [their] employer to produce such injury,” 

then the worker has the right to pursue recovery through civil suit “for any damages 

in  excess  of  compensation  and  benefits  paid  or  payable”  under  the  IIA. 

RCW 51.24.020.  As  the  Birklid  court  articulated,  when  employers  deliberately 

intend to injure employees, “[e]mployees’ remedies . . . should not be limited by the 

IIA” because “[e]mployers who engage in such egregious conduct should not burden 

and compromise the industrial insurance risk pool.”  127 Wn.2d at 859. 

Up  until  the  1990s,  Washington  courts  found  “deliberate  intention”  only 

when an employer or its agent physically assaulted an employee. Id. at 861-62. But, 

in Birklid, this court concluded that limiting the deliberate injury exception to assault 

cases “effectively read the statutory exception to the IIA’s exclusive remedy policy 

nearly  out  of  existence.”  Id.  at  862.  “If  physical  assault  were  the  perimeter 

of the exception the Legislature intended, however, it could have said so directly 

rather than using the words ‘deliberate intention . . . to produce such injury.’ The 

statutory  words  must,  therefore,  mean  something  more  than  assault  and  battery.” 

Id.  at  862-63  (alteration  in  original)  (quoting  RCW  51.24.020).  This  court 

recognized that though the deliberate injury exception is narrow, it still encompasses 

any injury caused by deliberate intention, meaning “‘a specific intent, and not merely 

8 

 
 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

carelessness  or  negligence,  however  gross.’”4  Id.  at  860  (quoting  Delthony  v. 

Standard Furniture Co., 119 Wash. 298, 300, 205 P. 379 (1922) (citing Jenkins v. 

Carman Mfg. Co., 79 Or. 448, 454, 155 P. 703 (1916))). Further, the court reaffirmed 

the  employer’s  intent  must  relate  to  the  injury,  not  the  act  causing  the  injury. 

Id. at 861. Under these strictures, the court adopted a two-pronged test, holding an 

employer  had  deliberate  intention  to  injure  an  employee  when  it  (1)  “had  actual 

knowledge that an injury was certain to occur” and (2) “willfully disregarded that 

knowledge.” Id. at 865. 

Applying this two-pronged  test  to  the  facts  in  Birklid,  the  court  found  that 

under prior precedent, the plaintiffs’ evidence could not have justified a finding of 

deliberate  intention  because  they  were  not  assaulted,  but  under  the  new  test,  the 

evidence was sufficient to survive summary judgment. Id. at 862-63. There, Boeing 

employees who were part of preproduction testing for a material containing phenol-

formaldehyde resin complained of symptoms such as “‘dizziness, dryness in nose 

4 This court rejected deliberate intention tests from other jurisdictions that did not align 
with Washington courts’ narrow interpretation of RCW 51.24.020 and the long-standing deference 
given to legislative intent embodied in RCW 51.04.010. Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865. It rejected the 
“substantial certainty” test, which defines intentional torts more broadly and recognizes deliberate 
intention “‘[i]f the actor knows that the consequences are certain, or substantially certain, to result 
from [their] act, and still goes ahead.’” Id. at 864 (quoting Beauchamp v. Dow Chem. Co., 427 
Mich. 1, 21, 398 N.W.2d 882 (1986)). It also rejected Oregon’s “conscious weighing” test, which 
recognizes  deliberate  intention  if  “the  employer  had  an  opportunity  consciously  to  weigh  the 
consequences of its act and knew that someone, not necessarily the plaintiff specifically, would be 
injured.” Id. at 865 (citing Lusk v. Monaco Motor Homes, Inc., 97 Or. App. 182, 775 P.2d 891 
(1989)).

and throat, burning eyes, and upset stomach.’” Id. at 856 (quoting the record). “As 

Boeing’s supervisor predicted, when full production began” using the same resin, 

workers  experienced  similar  symptoms.  Id.  The  court  concluded  that  Boeing 

deliberately  intended  to  injure  the  plaintiffs  because  it  had  observed  the 

preproduction workers becoming ill from exposure to the resin when it put the resin 

into  production.  Id.  at  862-63.  Boeing  willfully  disregarded  actual  knowledge  of 

continuing injuries to its employees when it “knew in advance its workers would 

become  ill  from  the  phenol-formaldehyde  fumes,  yet  put  the  new  resin  into 

production.” Id. at 863. 

Since  Birklid,  Washington  courts  have  found  plaintiffs  alleged  facts 

sufficient to support an inference of deliberate intention in only a few cases—almost 

exclusively  cases  similar  to  Birklid  where  employers  “knew  that  the  employees 

were  suffering  from  chemical-related  illnesses  and  that,  unless  the  working 

environment  was  changed,  continuing  injury  was  certain.”  Baker  v.  Schatz, 

80  Wn.  App.  775,  783,  912  P.2d  501  (1996);  see  also  Hope  v.  Larry’s  Mkts., 

108 Wn. App. 185, 29 P.3d 1268 (2001). In other words, following Birklid, plaintiffs 

have been able to satisfy the deliberate injury exception in only two circumstances: 

(1)  physical  assault  and  (2)  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals  causing  continuous, 

10 

 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

immediate,  and  visible  injury.5  Courts  have  declined  to  find  actual  knowledge 

when injuries were not certain to occur as the result of hazardous exposures, even if 

the  employers  knew  of  the  hazards  and  that  they  were  likely  or  probable 

to  cause  injuries.  See,  e.g.,  Garibay  v.  Advanced  Silicon  Materials,  Inc., 

139 Wn. App. 231, 238-39, 159 P.3d 494 (2007) (although employer knew or should 

have known that a rupture of a pipe was imminent or certain to eventually occur, the 

employer did not have actual knowledge that the injury to the plaintiff was certain 

to occur); Vallandigham, 154 Wn.2d at 18 (despite high probability that a student 

who  had  repeatedly  harmed  school  staff  would  injure  school  staff  again,  the 

student’s behavior was so unpredictable that “the school district here could not have 

been certain that its strategies for modifying [the student’s] behavior would fail such 

that [the student] would continue to injure school staff”). 

Our case law has treated an injury in the form of disease that takes time to 

manifest (like cancer) distinct from other types of injury, like rashes or burns that 

occur  very  quickly  after  exposure.  Further,  when  workplace  exposures  result  in 

5 There is only one case post-Birklid where facts were sufficient to justify a finding that an 
employer  deliberately  intended  to  injure  an  employee  that  did  not  involve  exposure  to  toxic 
chemicals causing continuous immediate and visible injury. In Michelbrink v. Washington State 
Patrol, 191 Wn. App. 414, 419-20, 363 P.3d 6 (2015), the court found that there could have been 
deliberate intent when the Washington State Patrol, the plaintiff’s employer, shot the plaintiff with 
a Taser during a work training and he eventually developed a fracture in his vertebrae and a bulged 
disc as a result of the electric shock. The court reasoned that the employer physically assaulted the 
plaintiff by  shooting him with  the Taser, and  it  knew in  doing so that an injury was certain to 
occur, even if it did not foresee that specific injury. Id. at 430. 

11 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

disease,  our  precedent  has  rendered  it  impossible  to  prove  the  actual  knowledge 

prong  of  Birklid’s  test  for  deliberate  injury.  In  2014,  this  court  closed  the  door 

on  proving  actual  knowledge  injury  was  certain  to  occur  in  asbestos-related 

diseases—and all latent diseases—when it decided Walston. 

In  Walston,  the  plaintiff-employee  was  exposed  to  asbestos  throughout  the 

decades  he  worked  for  Boeing;  he  was  later  diagnosed  with  mesothelioma,  as 

“caused  by  inhaling  asbestos  fibers.”  181  Wn.2d  at  394.  It  was  undisputed  that 

Boeing was aware of the hazards of asbestos exposure by the time of the plaintiff’s 

exposure;  that  asbestos  exposure  could  manifest  into  diseases  like  cancer,  even 

decades after exposure; and that recommended safety precautions could be taken to 

reduce asbestos exposure. Id. at 395. Despite such knowledge, the court concluded 

that the plaintiffs could not show the employer had actual knowledge that injury was 

certain to occur because, as the plaintiff’s expert testified, asbestos exposure is never 

certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease. Id. at 394, 397. Additionally, 

the  court  rejected  that  plaintiff’s  claim  that  the  employer’s  actual  knowledge  of 

employees  developing  asymptomatic  cellular-level  injury  from  asbestos  exposure 

could  satisfy  the  deliberate  injury  exception,  finding  that  such  asymptomatic 

cellular-level 

injuries  (1)  are  not 

themselves  compensable 

injuries,  and 

(2) create  only  a  risk  of  compensable  injury.  Id.  at  398;  accord  Shellenbarger  v.

Longview Fibre Co., 125 Wn. App. 41, 103 P.3d 807 (2004) (employer may have 

12 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

been negligent in exposing employees to asbestos but evidence did not amount to 

actual  knowledge  that  injury  was  certain  to  occur  when  employer  thought  the 

workplace was safe and did not know of any employees exhibiting signs of injury at 

the time of exposure), review denied 154 Wn.2d 1021 (2005). 

The  dissent  in  that  5-4  decision  challenged  the  majority’s  conclusion  that 

“certainty”  under  the  deliberate  intention  standard  set  forth  in  Birklid  means 

“absolute  certainty  that  a  particular  plaintiff  will  develop  a  particular  disease.” 

Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 403 (Wiggins, J., dissenting). The dissent reasoned that in 

Birklid, the employer did not need to “foretell every specific harm or victim” and, in 

fact, the employer “did not know which workers would get sick, whether the injuries 

would be compensable, or the severity of illnesses workers would experience.” Id. 

Additionally, the dissent opined that the unique qualities of diseases arising from 

exposure  to  toxic  substances  “makes  it  near  impossible  to  predict  with  absolute 

certainty” the injuries that will result from such exposures. Id. at 401. In so doing, 

the dissent referred to Birklid’s prediction of that result; the dissent observed that 

“[r]equiring 100 percent certainty would once again read the statutory exception out 

of existence in the context of disease” and, further, would violate the legislature’s 

clear intent of including diseases in the exception by defining diseases as injuries 

under the chapter. Id. at 403-04 (citing RCW 51.24.030(3)). The dissent urged that 

recognizing deliberately caused diseases under the deliberate injury exception would 

13 

 
 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

not  compromise  the  no-fault  system  created  by  the  IIA  but,  rather,  would  hold 

employers accountable for deliberate conduct as the IIA envisioned. Id. at 410-11. 

Now, in this case, where the facts are materially indistinguishable from those 

in Walston, the Court of Appeals concluded that since asbestos exposure is never 

certain  to  cause  asbestos  disease,  Cockrum’s  deliberate  intention  claim  was 

precluded by the holding in Walston. Cockrum, No. 85182-9-I, slip op. at 6-7. Under 

Walston, latent diseases such as asbestos-related diseases can never satisfy the first 

prong  of  the  deliberate  intention  test;  while  we  seemed  to  indicate  it  would  be 

possible to do so in that opinion, after reviewing subsequent decisions, pragmatically 

speaking, it seems to be impossible. 

Although  we  do  not  lightly  set  aside  precedent,  we  will  do  so  upon  clear 

showing it is both incorrect and harmful. State v. Crossguns, 199 Wn.2d 282, 290, 

505 P.3d 529 (2022); State v. Scherf, 192 Wn.2d 350, 379, 429 P.3d 776 (2018) (“A 

decision is incorrect if it is based on an inconsistency with the court’s precedent, 

with  the  State’s  constitution  or  statutes,  or  with  public  policy  considerations.  A 

decision  is  harmful  if  it  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  public  interest.”).  Thus, 

today  we  conclude  Walston’s  exclusion  of  diseases  from  recovery  under 

RCW 51.24.020 incorrectly contradicts the plain text of the statute and public policy 

behind the IIA. The holding in Walston is also harmful because it denies relief to 

employees who happen to be injured in the form of disease that may take years to 

14 

 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

manifest  rather  than  immediate  and  visible  injuries.  Therefore,  Walston  must  be 

overruled. 

First, Walston’s requirement of complete certainty that a disease will occur is 

incorrect because it is inconsistent with the text of the IIA and the policy that drives 

it.  If  a  statute’s  meaning  is  plain  on  its  face,  we  “must  give  effect  to  that 

plain  meaning  as  an  expression  of  legislative  intent.”  Dep’t  of  Ecology  v. 

Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). RCW 51.24.020 

allows an employee to bring a cause of action against their employer if an injury 

results “from the deliberate intention” of the employer. The term “certainty” does 

not appear anywhere in the statute; rather, the Birklid court used “actual knowledge 

that an injury was certain to occur” to help define the term “deliberate intention” as 

used in the statute. 127 Wn.2d at 865. Walston took it further, concluding that as 

“asbestos exposure is not certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease,” an 

employer cannot have actual knowledge a disease such as mesothelioma is certain 

to occur. 181 Wn.2d at 397. By that logic, workplace-caused diseases are excluded 

from the deliberate intention statute, though the plain language of the statute draws 

no such distinction. In fact, the IIA defines “injury” specifically for the purposes of 

the chapter permitting certain causes of action to include any “disease” compensable 

15 

 
 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

under  the  IIA.  RCW  51.24.030(3).6  But  under  Walston,  diseases  cannot  be 

compensable  under  that  chapter,  contrary  to  the  statutory  text,  because  of  the 

standard this court set. This may be the result the Walston court was trying to avoid, 

but the IIA does not seem to support that apparently categorical conclusion. 

Further,  the  IIA  reflects  the  legislative  policy  that  employers  who  do 

deliberately intend to injure their employees do not enjoy the IIA’s general immunity 

from  lawsuits  for  workplace  injuries.  Birklid,  127  Wn.2d  at  859-60.  Neither 

that  policy  nor  the  text  of  the  IIA  treat  diseases  differently  from  other  injuries 

because  the  purpose  of  the  deliberate  intention  exception  is  to  hold  employers 

accountable  based  on 

their 

intent 

to  cause 

injury,  not  based  on 

the 

type  of  injury  that  results.  See  id.  at  873  (the  deliberate  intention  exception 

is  meant  to  “‘deter  intentional  wrongdoing  by  employers’”  (quoting  Provost  v. 

Puget Sound Power and Light Co., 103 Wn.2d 750, 753, 696 P.2d 1238 (1985))); 

6  While  the  IIA  elsewhere  provides  a  different  definition  of  “injury”  as  “a  sudden  and 
tangible happening, of a traumatic nature, producing an immediate or prompt result, and occurring 
from without,  and such  physical  conditions  as  result therefrom” under RCW 51.08.100,  it also 
provides that words in the IIA shall have the meaning given in chapter 51.08 RCW, “[u]nless the 
context  indicates  otherwise.”  RCW  51.08.010.  The  specific  definition  of  “injury”  in  chapter 
51.24 RCW is explicit context provided by the legislature that this particular definition applies to 
the chapter that permits causes of action like this one. See Ass’n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. 
v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd., 182 Wn.2d 342, 356, 340 P.3d 849 (2015) (“A general statutory 
provision must yield to a more specific statutory provision.” (citing Waste Mgmt. of Seattle, Inc. 
v. Utils. & Transp. Comm’n, 123 Wn.2d 621, 629-30, 869 P.2d 1034 (1994); Kustura v. Dep’t of 
Lab. & Indus., 169 Wn.2d 81, 91, 233 P.3d 853 (2010))). The fact that the legislature chose to 
apply the definition of “injury” including diseases to the entirety of chapter 51.24 RCW rather than 
making the  choice  to  limit  the  definition shows intent to depart from the definition  of  “injury” 
under  RCW  51.08.100  and,  rather,  include  diseases  for  the  purpose  of  the  deliberate  intention 
exception under RCW 51.24.020. RCW 51.24.030(3).

see also Harry v. Buse Timber & Sales, Inc., 166 Wn.2d 1, 19, 201 P.3d 1011 (2009) 

(“A  core  purpose  of  the  IIA  is  to  allocate  the  cost  of  workplace  injuries  to  the 

industry  that  produces  them,  thereby  motivating  employers  to  make  workplaces 

safer.”); see also Br. of Amicus Curiae Dep’t of Lab. & Indus. at 4 (“exposure to the 

expenses  of  the  deliberate  injury  tort  dissuades  employers  from  perpetuating 

deliberate exposure to asbestos”), 22 (“Employers should not be permitted to play 

Russian roulette with workers’ lives.”). 

Scientific understanding of latent diseases and their causes may have evolved 

since the passage of the IIA (and will likely continue to evolve), but the policy of 

providing  redress  for  deliberately  caused  workplace  injuries  has  not.  Walston  is 

incorrect  because  it  adds  words  to  the  statute  where  there  are  none  (excluding 

diseases  caused  by  deliberate  intention),  renders  other  language  superfluous 

(RCW 51.24.030(3)’s inclusion of “disease” as a type of injury compensable in a 

cause of action under that chapter), and undermines the policy of providing a cause 

of action for deliberately intended workplace injuries including diseases. 

Second, Walston is harmful because it denies recovery for diseases caused by 

employers’  deliberate  intent.  “Employees’  remedies  for  deliberate  injury  by 

employers  should  not  be  limited  by  the  IIA.  Employers  who  engage  in  such 

egregious conduct should not burden and compromise the industrial insurance risk 

pool.”  Birklid,  127  Wn.2d  at  859.  As  discussed,  since  the  law  requires  absolute 

17 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

certainty under Walston, this means employers are immune from suit for not only 

cancers like mesothelioma, but for any latent disease caused by their deliberate intent 

because it is “near impossible to predict with absolute certainty how each exposure 

will affect a particular individual.” 181 Wn.2d 401 (Wiggins, J., dissenting). That 

rule means employers can avoid liability for requiring employees to handle nuclear 

waste without protection or requiring employees to smoke two packs of cigarettes 

every  day,  resulting  in  employees  eventually  developing  cancer.  The  employer 

conduct in those scenarios is more than gross negligence; rather, it crosses into the 

realm  of  deliberate  intention.  Under  the  logic  in  Walston,  any  employee  who 

contracts a disease arising from exposure to a toxic substance and their employer’s 

deliberate intent to produce that injury has no recourse under RCW 51.24.020. That 

result is both harmful and absurd, given the legislature’s intent behind the exception. 

Therefore, we overrule Walston as clearly incorrect and harmful. 

Contrary  to  counsel’s  contentions,  there  is  no  need  to  disturb  the  long-

standing precedent acknowledged by and continued in Birklid. In Birklid, the court’s 

task was to clarify that the deliberate intention exception applies to more than just 

assault cases because up to that point, our courts had “effectively read the statutory 

exception to the IIA’s exclusive remedy policy nearly out of existence.” 127 Wn.2d 

at 862. Now, recognizing that Walston effectively read the exception out of existence 

for a category of injuries, our task is to give effect to the legislature’s decision to 

18 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

include diseases as injuries within that exception. Given the unique characteristics 

of latent diseases in contrast to the immediate and visible injuries contemplated by 

our  precedent,  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  when  an  employer  may  have  deliberate 

intention to cause such an injury in line with the legislative intent and statutory text 

of  RCW  51.24.020.  We  hold  that  virtual  certainty  is  sufficient  to  prove  actual 

knowledge in latent disease cases. This degree of certainty is consistent with both 

purposes of the deliberate intention exception and the holding in Birklid—shielding 

employers  from  liability  when  injuries  result  from  accidents,  but  still  holding 

employers accountable in the narrow circumstances where there is deliberate intent 

to injure. Id. at 863 (“There was no accident here.”). 

Virtual certainty that a latent disease will occur may be evidenced by a number 

of factual circumstances, such as (1) the employer’s knowledge of ongoing, repeated 

development of symptoms known to be associated with the development of latent 

disease  over  time,  (2)  the  employer’s  knowledge  of  symptoms  developing  in 

employees  similarly  situated  to  the  plaintiff-employee,  (3)  the  timing  of  such 

symptoms  developing  prior  to  or  contemporaneous  with  the  plaintiff-employee’s 

exposure(s), and (4) whether the exposure arises from a common major cause within 

the employer’s control. This is a nonexclusive set of factors, as we recognize both 

that the individual facts of a case may be relevant and that we cannot predict the 

evolution of scientific understanding surrounding the development of diseases from 

19 

 
Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

workplace  exposures.  Although  a  person  with  symptoms  that  could  potentially 

develop into disease is not guaranteed to develop a latent disease, such symptoms 

do  “imply  a  lifelong  elevated  risk  for  .  .  .  cancer.”  2  CP  at  807.  There  are 

circumstances  under  which  an  employer  may  have  sufficient  knowledge  of  the 

hazardousness of the exposure, the existence of symptoms linked to latent disease, 

and  the  causal  relationship  between  the  two  for  the  employer  to  form  actual 

knowledge disease is virtually certain to occur. In those circumstances, the actual 

knowledge prong of the deliberate injury exception is satisfied. 

There is a notable legal difference between negligence and virtual certainty 

that  an  injury  will  occur.  Birklid,  127  Wn.2d  at  860  (quoting  Delthony, 

119 Wash.  at  300).  Employers  remain  immune  for  negligently  caused  injuries, 

including  disease.  See  id.  at  863  (“There  was  no  accident  here.”);  see  also 

9  LEX  K.  LARSON  ET  AL.,  LARSON’S  WORKERS’  COMPENSATION  LAW  §  103.03, 

at  103-9  (rev.  ed.  2024)  (“[W]hat  is  being  tested  [in  deliberate  injury  exception 

cases] is not the degree of gravity or depravity of the employer’s conduct, but rather 

the narrow issue of the intentional versus the accidental quality of the precise event 

producing  injury.”).  Part  of  the  “grand  compromise”  of  the  IIA,  however,  is  that 

employees  must  be  able  to  bring  civil  claims  to  hold  employers  accountable  for 

deliberate injuries caused by their employer. Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 859. Even under 

the  narrow  reading  of  the  deliberate  intention  exception  affirmed  by  decades  of 

20 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

Washington precedent, there is room for liability where injury in the form of disease 

results from the deliberate intention of the employer. RCW 51.24.020. 

As long as disease is a type of injury compensable under the IIA, the law must 

account for the uniqueness of a disease as a type of injury and allow for recovery 

when  the  employer  is  virtually  certain  disease  will  occur.  The  Birklid  certainty 

standard  remains  for  cases  where  injuries  are  immediate  and  visible,  such  as 

chemical  exposures causing rashes, nausea, dizziness,  etc.,  like in Birklid,  Baker, 

and  Hope.  However,  the  standard  to  prove  deliberate  intention  for  causing  latent 

diseases must be different from the standard set forth in Birklid due to the different 

nature of such injuries. Without such a standard, employers who know disease is 

virtually  certain  to  occur  in  employees  based  on  employees  developing  known 

disease symptoms would be excused from liability and escape their responsibility to 

bear the cost of appropriate remedial measures, which would be contrary to the text 

and policy of the IIA. See Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 859-60, 873. 

We  hold  that  a  plaintiff  can  satisfy  the  deliberate  injury  exception  under 

RCW 51.24.020 and Birklid if they demonstrate the employer had actual knowledge 

that  latent  diseases  are  virtually  certain  to  occur  and  willfully  disregard  such 

knowledge. Birklid is a two-pronged test: a plaintiff must demonstrate both that the 

employer  had  the  requisite  knowledge  of  the  certainty  of  injury  and  that  the 

employer willfully disregarded that knowledge. Id. at 865. Thus, even if a plaintiff 

21 

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 
No. 102881-4 

demonstrates actual knowledge of virtual certainty, an employer may not be liable 

if it took known remedial measures within its control. Here, the trial court granted 

summary judgment to Howmet on the basis of the actual knowledge prong under 

Walston and did not reach the second prong of willful disregard. Walston is now 

overruled. We therefore reverse and remand to the trial court to reevaluate summary 

judgment under the actual knowledge standard we adopt today. 

CONCLUSION 

In latent disease cases, an employer’s virtual certainty that disease will occur 

satisfies  the  actual  knowledge  prong  of  the  IIA’s  deliberate  injury  exception. 

We reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this 

opinion.

Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc. 

No. 102881-4 

MADSEN, J. (dissenting)—Washington’s legislature long ago decided that 

workers would receive swift, no-fault compensation for injuries suffered on the job rather 

than through civil litigation.  Lawmakers enacted this grand compromise in 1911, which 

later became the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW.  In exchange for a 

guarantee of workers’ compensation, employers were given immunity from most 

lawsuits.  Stertz v. Indus. Ins. Comm’n, 91 Wash. 588, 590-91, 158 P. 256 (1916).  An 

exception to employer immunity is for deliberate injury.  RCW 51.24.020.   

Thirty years ago, this court established the test for the deliberate injury exception:  

an employer must have “actual knowledge that an injury was certain to occur and 

willfully disregarded that knowledge.”  Birklid v. Boeing Co., 127 Wn.2d 853, 865, 904 

P.2d 278 (1995).  We applied this test in Walston v. Boeing Co., 181Wn.2d 391, 398-99,

334 P.3d 519 (2014), concluding that a plaintiff did not satisfy the exception because 

asbestos is not certain to cause injury. 

In spite of established precedent, the majority views asbestos claims as a matter of 

first impression and allows Jeffrey Cockrum’s suit to proceed under the deliberate intent 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

to injure exception.  To reach this result, the majority takes the extraordinary step of 

overruling Walston—which no party asked us to do—and adopts a test this court already 

rejected in Birklid.   

In my view, precedent is clear.  Cockrum did not show that his employer, Howmet 

Aerospace Inc., had actual knowledge that asbestos exposure would produce certain 

injury.  Therefore, summary judgment for Howmet was properly granted.  The majority 

dislikes this outcome.  Nevertheless, it is the only outcome possible that preserves the 

grand compromise.  In over 100 years, the legislature has not amended the deliberate 

injury exception.  If that exception is to be broadened, it is the legislature that should do 

so with public input and considered deliberation.  I respectfully dissent. 

1. Deliberate Intent Exception

The IIA is the “grand compromise” between the interests of employers and 

workers injured on the job.  Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 859.  The Act “was designed to be a 

comprehensive and exclusive compensation system.”  16 DAVID K. DEWOLF & KELLER 

W. ALLEN, WASHINGTON PRACTICE: TORT LAW AND PRACTICE § 12:6, at 572 (5th ed

2020).  While the statute was intended to be liberally construed in favor of coverage, 

Dep’t of Lab. & Indus. v. Lyons Enters., Inc., 185 Wn.2d 721, 734, 374 P.3d 1097 (2016), 

we interpret exceptions narrowly.  See Vallandigham v. Clover Park Sch. Dist. No. 400, 

154 Wn.2d 16, 27, 109 P.3d 805 (2005).  The legislature did not grant immunity to 

employers who injured employees intentionally.  An employee may sue an employer in 

2 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

tort if an “injury results to a worker from the deliberate intention of [their] employer to 

produce such injury.”  RCW 51.24.020.   

Before 1995, Washington courts interpreted the deliberate intent exception to 

apply only to intentional torts, that is, when an employer or agent committed an assault 

on an employee.  Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 861-62 (citing Perry v. Beverage, 121 Wash. 652, 

209 P. 1102 (1922), 214 P. 146 (1923); Mason v. Kenyon Zero Storage, 71 Wn. App. 5, 

856 P.2d 410 (1993)).  Even gross negligence did not satisfy the exception.  Id. at 860 

(quoting Delthony v. Standard Furniture Co., 119 Wash. 298, 300, 205 P. 379 (1922)).   

Birklid noted that the focus on intentional torts “effectively read the statutory 

exception . . . out of existence” and sought to provide a clearer articulation.  Id. at 862.  

First, Birklid examined iterations of the deliberate intent test from other states:  the 

“substantial certainty” line of cases in which an actor is substantially certain that a result 

will occur from an act and still goes ahead, and the conscious weighing test in which an 

employer weighed the consequences of an act and knew someone, not necessarily the 

plaintiff specifically, would be injured.  Id. at 864-65.1  Birklid rejected these tests as too 

1 These variations of the deliberate intent test were adopted in Michigan, North Carolina, 
West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Louisiana, and Oregon.  Beauchamp v. Dow Chem. Co., 427

(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

“expansive” in light of Washington courts’ historically narrow reading of RCW 

51.24.020.  Id. at 864, 865.   

Instead, Birklid formed a narrow test for determining deliberate injury:  the 

employer “had actual knowledge that an injury was certain to occur” and “willfully 

disregarded that knowledge.”  Id. at 865.   

Applying this test, Birklid held that the plaintiffs’ deliberate injury suit overcame 

summary judgment.  The plaintiffs were employed by Boeing and were exposed to a 

chemical resin.  Before putting the resin into full production, Boeing conducted a 

preliminary test.  The employees exposed during the pretest complained of dizziness, dry 

nose and throat, eye burning, and stomach upset.  A supervisor notified Boeing 

management of these results, cautioned that the problem would increase during 

production, and requested improved ventilation.  This request was denied.  Once the resin 

was used in full production, employees experienced dermatitis, rashes, nausea, 

headaches, dizziness, and fainting.  In light of this evidence, Birklid concluded that 

Boeing knew in advance that its workers would become ill from the resin but went 

forward with production resulting in injuries.   

Birklid brought the deliberate intent exception beyond physical assault and into 

chemical exposure cases, but most suits continued to reflect physical assaults.  In 

Vallandigham, a school’s employees asserted the deliberate intent exception based on the 

district’s knowledge that a disabled student would injure them.  154 Wn.2d at 25-26.  

Despite the school’s attempt to mitigate the situation, the employees produced evidence 

4 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

that the student had committed 96 injuries over the school year and produced 7 workers’ 

compensation claims.  Id. at 24.   

This court held that the school employees had not satisfied Birklid.  Vallandigham 

explained that demonstrating an employer’s actual knowledge “can be met in only very 

limited circumstances where continued injury is not only substantially certain, but certain 

to occur.”  Id. at 32.  Foreseeability and probability that an injury would occur were 

insufficient, as were the unpredictable actions of a child with disabilities.  Id. at 33.  

The Court of Appeals confronted what appears to be the first post-Birklid chemical 

exposure case in Baker v. Schatz, 80 Wn. App. 775, 912 P.2d 501 (1996).  There, 

employees sued for exposure to toxic chemicals, relying on facts similar to Birklid:  

breathing difficulties that developed into bronchitis and pneumonia, daily nausea, 

headaches, dizziness, skin rashes, and fainting.  The employees repeatedly complained to 

their employer about these injuries, but the employer denied that the chemicals caused 

any health problems.  The trial court denied the employer’s motion for summary 

judgment.  The Court of Appeals reviewed Birklid and observed that the deliberate injury 

exception requires employers to know “that injury was certain to occur.”  Id. at 783 

(emphasis added).  The court concluded that the plaintiffs alleged facts supporting an 

inference that the employer knew its employees were suffering from chemical-related 

illness and continuing injury was certain.  Like Birklid, the employer in Baker knew 

exposure to chemicals “would cause and did cause injury.”  Id. at 784. 

5 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

Similar to Birklid and Baker, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed that chemical 

exposure could constitute deliberate intent in Hope v. Larry’s Markets, 108 Wn. App. 

185, 194, 29 P.3d 1268 (2001).  In Hope, an employer began using industrial-strength 

cleaners that could cause severe skin irritation and employees began experiencing rashes 

and blisters.  The injured employees complained several times, even providing a doctor’s 

note stating that chemical exposure caused the severe rashes.  The employer denied that 

the chemicals were dangerous and required employees to use them, providing minimal 

safety precautions.  An employee sued under the deliberate intent to injure exception, 

which the trial court dismissed.  The Court of Appeals reviewed the dismissal as a 

summary judgment motion and reversed, concluding that the employee’s evidence 

showed repeated complaints that chemical exposure continuously caused injuries, 

sufficiently establishing “‘actual knowledge that an injury was certain to occur.’”  Id. at 

193 (quoting Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865), 194.   

The Court of Appeals directly addressed an asbestos deliberate intent claim in 

Shellenbarger v. Longview Fibre Co., 125 Wn. App. 41, 103 P.3d 807 (2004).  The court 

affirmed summary judgment for the employer in this case.  The employer was aware of 

the dangers of asbestos during the 1960s when the complaining employee was exposed 

and eventually developed lung disease and asbestosis.  The Court of Appeals noted that 

Birklid “adopted a literal meaning of ‘certain injury’ when it expressly declined to adopt 

the ‘substantial certainty’ test used in some other states.”  Id. at 47.  Birklid requires 

certainty, and “[c]ertainty leaves no room for chance.”  Id.  The court also observed that 

6 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

exposure to asbestos does not always result in injury to every person and that other 

employees at Longview Fibre did not exhibit signs of injury.  Therefore, the Court of 

Appeals held, a reasonable finder of fact could not conclude the employer knew the 

complaining employee, or any other employee, would be injured by exposure to asbestos.  

This court addressed an asbestos claim in Walston.  There, a Boeing employee was 

exposed to asbestos over many years, eventually developing mesothelioma.  Experts 

concluded that the disease was caused by an exposure incident where pipe insulation was 

being repaired in the ceiling above the plaintiff’s work area.  Though the insulation 

workers wore personal protective equipment, the workers below did not.  Boeing 

supervisors denied employee requests to relocate and recommended employees avoid the 

area below the ceiling repairs.  Importantly, the plaintiff’s medical experts “conceded that 

asbestos exposure is not certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease.”  Walston, 

181 Wn.2d at 394.   

Walston concluded that Boeing was entitled to summary judgment pursuant to this 

court’s deliberate intent precedent.  The Birklid test requires an employer to know that an 

injury was “certain to occur.”  127 Wn.2d at 865.  A probable or even substantially 

certain injury is not sufficient to show deliberate intent, nor is disregard of a risk of 

injury.  Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 397 (quoting Vallandigham, 154 Wn.2d at 21, 36, 28).  

Because asbestos exposure is not certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease, 

Walston concluded that the plaintiff did not raise an issue of material fact as to whether 

Boeing actually knew injury was “certain to occur.”  Id. at 397.   

7 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

Further, Walston disagreed that deliberate intent is satisfied as long as evidence 

shows someone, not necessarily the plaintiff, is certain to be injured.  Birklid considered 

that argument when it rejected Oregon’s conscious weighing test.  Walston also clarified 

that deliberate intent to injure does not require immediate and visible injury—it is simply 

one way to raise an issue of material fact as to an employer’s knowledge of certain injury.  

Finally, Walston disagreed that certain injury occurs based on cellular level injury 

from asbestos, and even so, cellular injury without symptoms is not a compensable 

injury.  Compensable injury (mesothelioma, for example) is a risk but is not certain to 

occur from asbestos exposure.  Because certain injury is required pursuant to Birklid, 

cellular injury does not meet the deliberate intent standard.  

The dissent in Walston would have held that Birklid’s “certainty” requirement 

“does not mean absolute certainty.”  Id. at 403 (Wiggins, J., dissenting).  The dissent 

characterized Birklid as requiring proof that an employer had a “high degree of 

confidence that injury would result.”  Id.  The majority’s interpretation, the dissent 

asserted, would render the deliberate intent exception unavailable for diseases that the 

IIA includes as an injury.  Id. at 403-04 (citing RCW 51.24.030(3)).  The dissent also 

argued that “certainty can be achieved with less” than literal certainty that a specific 

result would occur based on the difficulties of proving diseases stemming from chemical 

exposure.  Id. at 406.  Instead, the dissent would have interpreted “certainty” to mean 

“virtual certainty” that injury will occur.  Id. at 410.  Anything more stringent, the dissent 

claimed, would allow an employer to escape liability contrary to the IIA.  Id. at 411.

(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

Taken together, Birklid and its progeny have maintained a narrow avenue for 

injured workers to sue in tort under the deliberate intent exception.  To prove actual 

knowledge, an injury must be certain to occur.  Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865; Shellenbarger, 

125 Wn. App. at 47 (“The Washington Supreme Court adopted a literal meaning of 

‘certain injury.’”).  Probable injury or injury that is virtually or substantially certain is 

insufficient.  Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 397; Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865.  Immediate visible 

injury is not required but is one means of showing an employer had knowledge that 

injury was certain to occur.  Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 398.   

Washington’s chemical exposure cases compel the outcome here.  The facts of 

Cockrum’s case are practically indistinguishable from Walston.  Cockrum, like the 

plaintiff in Walston, worked in an area where he was exposed to asbestos.  Neither 

Cockrum nor the employee in Walston was warned that asbestos was dangerous nor did 

they wear protective equipment when working around the chemical.  Both plaintiffs later 

developed mesothelioma caused by workplace exposure to asbestos but did not exhibit 

immediate injuries postexposure.  Experts in both cases conceded that asbestos exposure 

is not certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease.  Both employers were aware 

that asbestos was hazardous.   

In short, “[c]ertainty leaves no room for chance.”  Shellenbarger, 125 Wn. App. at 

46.  Asbestos exposure does not result in disease in every person, thus it creates a 

substantial risk of injury.  Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 397.  Birklid requires more, however.  

Certain injury must occur.  127 Wn.2d at 864-65.  The evidence presented in this case 

9 

 
 
No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

shows that asbestos exposure risked injury, but it does not demonstrate that Howmet had 

actual knowledge that injury was certain to occur.  See Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 397; 

Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 864.2   

Legislative acquiescence further supports Walston’s interpretation of RCW 

51.24.020.  “When considering challenges to previous statutory interpretations, ‘[t]his 

court presumes that the legislature is aware of judicial interpretations of its enactments 

and takes its failure to amend a statute following a judicial decision interpreting that 

statute to indicate legislative acquiescence in that decision.’”  State v. Otton, 185 Wn.2d 

673, 685-86, 374 P.3d 1108 (2016) (alteration in original) (quoting City of Federal Way 

v. Koenig, 167 Wn.2d 341, 348, 217 P.3d 1172 (2009)).  While evidence of legislative

acquiescence is not conclusive, it is a factor to consider.  Fast v. Kennewick Pub. Hosp. 

Dist., 187 Wn.2d 27, 39-40, 384 P.3d 232 (2016) (quoting Safeco Ins. Cos. v. Meyering, 

102 Wn.2d 385, 392, 687 P.2d 195 (1984)). 

From Perry and Delthony in 1922, to Birklid in 1995, and through Walston in 

2014, the legislature has not amended RCW 51.24.020 in response to this court’s narrow 

interpretation of the deliberate intent exception.  Had Walston’s holding on asbestos-

related claims been contrary to the legislature’s intent, it is reasonable that lawmakers 

would have changed the statute in response.  That has not occurred.  Therefore, as we 

2 Though Cockrum contends that Howmet had evidence of its employees developing 

symptoms of nonmalignant asbestos-related disease, this does not prove actual knowledge that 
disease like cancer or mesothelioma would occur in exposed employees.  The evidence of 
continuing illness shows Howmet knew that asbestos caused the risk of disease, not that it would 
result in a compensable injury to any of its employees.   

10 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

recognized in State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170, 174, 481 P.3d 521 (2021), given the 

principles of legislative acquiescence and stare decisis, the legislature rather than the 

court must change the statute’s intent.   

Washington’s system recognizes the reality that employees who develop certain 

diseases cannot sue in tort, but it also guarantees that workers will receive compensation 

regardless of their employer’s fault.  This certainty is the outcome of the grand 

compromise made more than a century ago.  Cockrum, like the plaintiff in Walston, 

cannot demonstrate that Howmet had actual knowledge of certain injury pursuant to 

RCW 51.24.020.  Thus, summary judgment was appropriate.    

2. Overruling Walston

As a procedural matter, only the State, acting as amicus curiae, contends that 

Walston and Birklid should be abandoned.  Br. of Amicus Curiae Dep’t of Lab. & Indus. 

at 14-18.  Appellate courts do not generally decide issues presented solely by amicus and 

raised for the first time on appeal. State v. Duncan, 185 Wn.2d 430, 440, 374 P.3d 83 

(2016); Maynard Inv. Co. v. McCann, 77 Wn.2d 616, 621, 465 P.2d 657 (1970) 

(“Normally the rule is that an issue or theory not presented to the trial court will not be 

considered by the Supreme Court for the first time on appeal.”); RAP 2.5(a).  For that 

reason alone, we should not reach the issue.   

The majority would presumably answer that we have authority to address any 

matter necessary to reach a proper decision.  State v. Cantu, 156 Wn.2d 819, 822 n.1, 132 

P.3d 725 (2006) (citing Siegler v. Kuhlman, 81 Wn.2d 448, 502 P.2d 1181 (1972)).  But,

11 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

“arriving at a proper decision” demands more than just this court’s desire to revisit a 

settled issue.  As noted, overruling Walston was not raised at trial or in the Court of 

Appeals.  Nor did this court direct the parties to submit additional briefing to address the 

issue, as we have often done.  RAP 12.1(b); e.g., State v. Aho, 137 Wn.2d 736, 741, 975 

P.2d 512 (1999); Greengo v. Pub. Emps. Mut. Ins. Co., 135 Wn.2d 799, 813, 959 P.2d

657 (1998); Siegler, 81 Wn.2d at 462 (Neill, J., dissenting).3  I agree that this court has 

inherent authority to reach any matter necessary for a just decision.  I disagree with the 

court’s decision to do so here considering the issue was raised for the first time in this 

court by amicus and without direct input from the parties.    

I also disagree with the majority’s decision to overturn Walston.  Majority at 14-

18. This court does not set aside precedent lightly.  State v. Kier, 164 Wn.2d 798, 804,

194 P.3d 212 (2008).  Legal precedent must operate in a reasonably certain, consistent, 

and predictable manner to allow citizens to guide their conduct and permit judges to 

render their decisions with some measure of confidence.  State v. Stalker, 152 Wn. App. 

805, 810-11, 219 P.3d 722 (2009) (citing In re Pers. Restraint of Mercer, 108 Wn.2d 714, 

720-21, 741 P.2d 559 (1987)).  This, the doctrine of stare decisis, gives stability and

clarity in the law, ensuring that it will not be altered due to “‘incautious action or the 

whims of current holders of judicial office.’”  Id. at 811 (quoting Lunsford v. Saberhagen 

3 We have recognized that there are occasions when an issue is purely legal and a legal 

violation is “so apparent” that additional briefing is unnecessary.  Aho, 137 Wn.2d at 741.  
Whether to overturn a past decision is rarely apparent, and this court should be wary of wading 
into such complicated waters without the benefit of briefing from parties as well as amici that 
squarely addresses and robustly debates the issue.

(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

Holdings, Inc., 166 Wn.2d 264, 278, 208 P.3d 1092 (2009)).  Courts may change a rule of 

law “‘“when reason so requires.”’”  Mercer, 108 Wn.2d at 721 (quoting House v. Erwin, 

81 Wn.2d 345, 348, 501 P.2d 1221 (1972), rev’d on reh’g, 83 Wn.2d 898, 524 P.2d 911 

(1974) (quoting In re Rts. to Waters of Stranger Creek, 77 Wn.2d 649, 653, 466 P.2d 508 

(1970))).  The party seeking to overrule a case bears the burden of demonstrating that a 

judicial decision is clearly “incorrect and harmful.”  Id.   

The majority concludes that Walston is clearly incorrect because it contradicts the 

text of RCW 51.24.020 and the policy underlying the IIA.  Majority at 14-15.  To the 

contrary—it is the majority’s assertion that is clearly without merit when considered in 

light of the historic interpretation of RCW 51.24.020.  Indeed, one would think the 

legislature would have noticed the supposed contradiction sometime in the last 100-plus 

years since our court’s initial construction in Perry and Delthony.  

Moreover, we have “rejected invitations to overrule prior decisions based on 

arguments that were adequately considered and rejected in the original decisions 

themselves.”  State v. Barber, 170 Wn.2d 854, 864-65, 248 P.3d 494 (2011) (citing Key 

Design Inc. v. Moser, 138 Wn.2d 875, 883, 983 P.2d 653 (1999) (noting the various 

complaints against the decision were “not new” and had already been “considered and 

rejected”); Brower v. State, 137 Wn.2d 44, 75, 969 P.2d 42 (1998) (explaining that a case 

is not lightly overturned where “the varying views on the issue [were] thoroughly 

explored in the case”); Brutsche v. City of Kent, 164 Wn.2d 664, 682, 193 P.3d 110 

13 

 
 
No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

(2008) (rejecting a challenge based on “the same arguments that were thoroughly 

considered and decided” in the original case)).   

This case does not present a new issue or one of first impression.  See Brower, 137 

Wn.2d at 74-75.  Walston already addressed asbestos-related diseases pursuant to facts 

practically indistinguishable from the present case and thoroughly explored the varying 

views on the matter.  See id. at 75.  As noted above, Cockrum did not argue that Walston 

is incorrect or harmful.   

Rather than reject Cockrum’s argument that Walston can be distinguished (it 

cannot), the majority accepts amicus’s invitation to overturn the case and adopts a 

“virtual certainty” test, which can only have been taken from the Walston dissent.  181 

Wn.2d at 410 (Wiggins, J., dissenting) (“An intentional wrong must amount to a virtual 

certainty that bodily injury or death will result.”); majority at 19 (“We hold that virtual 

certainty is sufficient to prove actual knowledge in latent disease cases.”).  The court was 

already presented with the opportunity to adopt the virtual certainty test in Walston.  It 

declined.   

Further confusing matters, the Walston dissent declared that Birklid accommodates 

virtual certainty and at the same time recognized that it is encompassed by substantial 

certainty, which Birklid rejected.  181 Wn.2d at 406 n.5 (citing Van Dunk v. Reckson 

Assocs. Realty Corp., 210 N.J. 449, 460-61, 45 A.3d 965 (2012) (substantial certain 

standard requires a virtual certainty)); Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865 (“We decline to adopt 

14 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

the ‘substantial certainty’ test.”).  In adopting the virtual certainty test,4 the majority 

conflicts with Birklid and reads in a special exception to the exception—literal certainty 

is still required for all other claims but only virtual certainty for latent disease.  See 

majority at 3.  The majority hamstrings future courts and litigants, forcing them into a 

quixotic choice:  follow Birklid, which rejected the substantial/virtual certainty test, or 

follow the majority’s virtual certainty test and consider Birklid overruled sub silentio.  

See Lunsford, 166 Wn.2d at 280 (“Where we have expressed a clear rule of law . . . we 

will not—and should not—overrule it sub silentio.”). 

Further, Walston is not inconsistent with the text of the IIA.  See majority at 15.  

The majority takes issue with Walston for adding words to RCW 51.24.020 because the 

term “certainty” does not appear in the statute.  Id. at 15, 17.  This objection must be 

made to Birklid as well, as it interpreted the deliberate intent exception to mean that an 

employer must have actual knowledge that injury was “certain to occur.”  127 Wn.2d at 

865.    

4 If the deliberate injury test was rooted in the common law, the majority’s decision to 

reimagine it would rest on firmer ground.  Senear v. Daily J.-Am., 97 Wn.2d 148, 152, 641 P.2d 
1180 (1982) (common law is shaped and refined by judges).  A rule tested by experience and 
found lacking can be reformulated.  Id. (“Common law is not static. It is consistent with reason 
and common sense . . . ‘Its principles are not mere printed fiats, but are living tools to be used in 
solving emergent problems.’” (quoting Mills v. Orcas Power & Light Co., 56 Wn.2d 807, 819, 
355 P.2d 781 (1960))).  This case is governed by statute, not common law.  The issue has been 
acted on by the legislature, and we have interpreted that legislative enactment.  RCW 51.24.020; 
Walston, 181 Wn.2d at 397-98; Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 865.  Our discretion to reexamine and 
reformulate the deliberate injury test in light of today’s facts is contrary to the principle of stare 
decisis.  See Stalker, 152 Wn. App. at 811.  “‘[R]espect for precedence is strongest in the area of 
statutory construction.’”  Deggs v. Asbestos Corp. Ltd., 186 Wn.2d 716, 730, 381 P.3d 32 (2016) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hubbard v. United States, 514 U.S. 695, 711, 115 S. 
Ct. 1754, 131 L. Ed. 2d 779 (1995) (plurality opinion)).

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

The majority builds on this objection.  Walston concluded that “asbestos exposure 

is not certain to cause mesothelioma or any other disease”; then, according to the 

majority, all workplace-caused diseases are excluded from the deliberate intent exception. 

181 Wn.2d at 394; majority at 15.  But Walston did not make such a broad holding, 

expressly or by implication.  That case concerned solely asbestos-related diseases.  

Though its application of Birklid’s certainty test to toxic exposures undoubtedly makes 

such claims more difficult to prove, that does not mean workplace-caused diseases are 

foreclosed categorically.  See majority at 16, 19.  As the Court of Appeals observed, 

coverage of “an ailment does not imply a particular amenability to its being deliberately 

caused, or proven to be deliberately caused.”  Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clerk-Ullman, 

Inc., No. 85182-9-I, slip op. at 7 (Wash. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2024) (unpublished), 

https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/851829.pdf.5   

Nor does Walston undermine the policy of the IIA.  Majority at 17.  The IIA 

resolved competing interests in workplace tort suits.  Employees receive swift, no-fault 

compensation for workplace injuries in exchange for employer immunity, except for 

injuries that were deliberately intended.  Birklid, 127 Wn.2d at 859.  The policy 

motivating the exception has “sound roots.”  Id.  Employers who engage in egregious 

5 The majority acknowledges that abandoning a prior decision rests on a clear showing 

that it is incorrect and harmful.  Majority at 14.  Yet the majority’s reasoning is replete with 
equivocal language.  E.g., id. at 14 (stating that Walston “seemed to indicate” it was possible that 
asbestos claims could satisfy the deliberate intent exception, but it now “seems” impossible 
(emphasis added)), 16 (“[T]he IIA does not seem to support that apparently categorical 
conclusion.” (emphasis added)).  Such uncertain language is far from a clear showing. 

16 

No. 102881-4 
(Madsen, J., dissenting) 

conduct such as deliberately intending to injure their workers should not burden and 

compromise the industrial insurance risk pool.  Id.  Birklid continued Washington’s 

historically narrow interpretation of the deliberate intent exception.  Id. at 859-60, 865.  

Walston applied Birklid, narrowing the exception’s application to certain diseases.  It is 

the majority’s decision here that upsets this balance, undermining Birklid and the grand 

compromise itself.   

CONCLUSION 

I disagree with the majority’s expansion of the deliberate intent exception based 

solely on its desire to revisit and overrule Walston, particularly when no party has asked 

us to do so.  We should instead follow established precedent.  Cockrum’s case is 

materially indistinguishable from Walston.  The evidence shows that asbestos does not 

result in injurious disease to every exposed person.  Asbestos-related diseases are a risk, 

but not certain to occur, as Walston and Birklid require.  We should therefore conclude 

that Cockrum does not satisfy the actual knowledge requirement of the exemption and 

affirm the Court of Appeals.  However reluctant we may be to uphold the sometimes 

harsh reality of our workers’ compensation system, that is the grand compromise.  

Altering that bargain is a matter for the legislature, not this court.  With these 

considerations in mind, I respectfully dissent.
