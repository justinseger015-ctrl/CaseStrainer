# Comprehensive Test Results - 1033940.pdf

## Test Date
October 8, 2025

## Summary
- **Total Citations**: 89
- **Total Clusters**: 34
- **Contamination Status**: ✅ **PASS** - No contamination detected

## Key Finding: Contamination Fixed! ✅

### Washington Spirits Case (182 Wn.2d 342 / 340 P.3d 849)
- **Cluster Name**: Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd.
- **Extracted Case Name**: Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd.
- **Canonical Name**: None (API not called in test)
- **Result**: ✅ **PASS** - No contamination in extracted_case_name

**Critical Success**: The word "Association" does NOT appear in the extracted_case_name, which is correct because it doesn't appear in the user's document. The canonical data (which would contain "Association of Washington Spirits & Wine Distributors") is properly separated.

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Case Name Truncation ⚠️
The extracted case name is missing the beginning:
- **Current**: "Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd."
- **Should be**: "Ass'n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd."

**Context from PDF**:
```
' scheme as  a whole.ö  AssÆn of Wash. 
Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd., 182 Wn.2d 342, 350, 340 
P.3d 849 (2015)
```

The text shows "AssÆn of Wash." before "Spirits & Wine Distribs", but the regex pattern is only matching from "Spirits" onwards.

### 2. Sentence Fragment Extracted as Case Name ❌
**Cluster with problematic extraction**:
- **Extracted**: "We decline to address the standing argument, as it is beyond the scope of the certified question. See Carlsen v. Glob. Client Sols."

This is clearly not a case name - it's a full sentence. The cleaning logic should have removed this but failed.

## Clustering Accuracy
Overall clustering appears correct:
- Parallel citations are properly grouped (e.g., 182 Wn.2d 342 + 340 P.3d 849)
- Cluster sizes match expected citation counts
- Years are correctly extracted

## Data Separation ✅
The critical requirement is met:
- `extracted_case_name` contains ONLY text from the user's document
- `canonical_name` is properly separated (None in this test, would contain API data in production)
- No cross-contamination between extracted and canonical fields

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Abbreviated Case Name Pattern
The regex patterns in `CitationExtractor._init_case_name_patterns()` need to handle abbreviated words before the main case name, such as:
- "Ass'n of Wash." (Association of Washington)
- "Dep't of" (Department of)
- Other common legal abbreviations

### Priority 2: Improve Sentence Fragment Cleaning
The `_clean_case_name_from_extraction()` function needs better logic to detect and remove complete sentences that aren't case names.
