FIX Issue 3: Remove signal words and procedural phrases from case names

Problem: Case names contaminated with signal words and procedural language
- "Id. For example, in Knocklong Corp. v. Kingdom of Afghanistan"
- "vacated and remanded"

Solution (unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py):
1. Added patterns to catch procedural phrases:
   - "vacated and remanded", "reversed and affirmed", etc.
   - Rejects purely procedural results
2. Improved "Id." handling:
   - Catches "Id. For example, in" combinations
   - Also handles "E.g.", "Cf." at start
3. Added validation after cleaning:
   - Rejects empty parties (< 2 chars)
   - Rejects procedural-only words ("and", "or", "the", etc.)
4. Applied fixes to BOTH extraction methods

Expected Results:
✅ "vacated and remanded" -> rejected (not extracted)
✅ "Id. For example, in X v. Y" -> "X v. Y"
✅ "See also X v. Y" -> "X v. Y"

Time: 15 minutes
