Add comprehensive logging to trace async data flow and create TO-DO list

Added detailed logging to trace why cluster canonical data and parallel 
propagation aren't working:

1. Created ASYNC_ISSUES_TODO.md with comprehensive analysis
   - 6 specific issues documented
   - Root cause investigation steps
   - Success criteria defined

2. Added logging to unified_clustering_master.py
   - Log each citation checked for verification/canonical data
   - Log when best_verified citation is found
   - Log cluster canonical data extraction
   - Warn when no verified citation found

This logging will help identify exactly where the data flow breaks
and why fixes aren't being applied in async processing.

Next: Submit PDF and examine worker logs to see what's happening.
