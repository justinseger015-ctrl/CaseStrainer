CRITICAL FIX: Enable true_by_parallel by marking unverified citations

Root cause: Batch verification only updated citations with verified=True.
Citations that returned 404 were SKIPPED - never marked as verified=False.
Result: Propagation loop thought ALL citations were verified.

Example bug:
- Cluster: [584 U.S. 554, 138 S. Ct. 1649, 200 L. Ed. 2d 931]
- 584 U.S. 554 → 404 (not found) but never marked verified=False
- 138 S. Ct. 1649 → verified=True
- 200 L. Ed. 2d 931 → verified=True
- Propagation check: "All 3 citations already verified" (WRONG!)
- Result: No true_by_parallel propagation

Fix: Added else clause to explicitly mark unverified citations
- If result.verified == True → Apply canonical data, set verified=True
- If result.verified == False → Set verified=False, store error message
- Now propagation will see: 1 unverified + 2 verified in cluster
- Sets 584 U.S. 554: true_by_parallel=True, copies canonical data
- Result: ALL 3 citations get canonical data even though only 2 directly verified!

Expected improvement:
- Clusters with partial verification will now propagate to all parallels
- Unverified citations benefit from verified siblings
- Higher canonical data coverage
- true_by_parallel field finally works as designed!

This is the missing piece for complete clustering functionality.
