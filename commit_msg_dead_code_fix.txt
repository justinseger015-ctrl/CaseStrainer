FIX: Remove dead code causing "referenced before assignment" error

ISSUE:
Error: "local variable 'UnifiedInputProcessor' referenced before assignment"
Status: 500 Internal Server Error

ROOT CAUSE:
Line 268 had: processor = UnifiedInputProcessor()
This line was OUTSIDE any try-except block and created an unused instance.

When the module-level import at line 26 failed or had issues,
line 268 would throw "referenced before assignment" error.

PROBLEMS FOUND:
1. Module-level import of UnifiedInputProcessor at line 26
2. Unused processor instantiation at line 268 (dead code)
3. Processor recreated again at line 430 (the one actually used)

SOLUTION:
1. Removed module-level import (line 26)
   - Now imported locally only where needed (in try blocks)
   - Prevents startup failures from cascading

2. Removed dead code instantiation (line 268)
   - Never used anywhere
   - Caused scope/assignment errors

3. Keep local import at line 395 (inside try block)
   - Safe error handling
   - Only imported when actually needed

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/vue_api_endpoints_updated.py
  - Removed line 26: module-level import
  - Removed line 268: dead code instantiation
  - Kept line 395: local try-block import

BENEFITS:
✅ No more "referenced before assignment" errors
✅ Better error isolation (imports in try blocks)
✅ Cleaner code (no dead code)
✅ Safer startup (no module-level dependencies)

TESTING:
✅ Backend restarts successfully
✅ Container healthy (Up 5 minutes)
✅ Ready to process requests

This fixes the 500 error when trying to analyze documents.
