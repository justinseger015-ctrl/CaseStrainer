Created comprehensive documentation:
- PHASE1_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md: Detailed test cases and success criteria
- PHASE2_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md: Full plan for deeper consolidation
- CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md: High-level overview and quick reference

These documents provide clear guidance for testing Phase 1 changes
and planning Phase 2 deeper consolidation work.
