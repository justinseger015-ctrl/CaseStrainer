# ✅ Service Readiness Checks Added to cslaunch

## What Changed

`cslaunch` now **waits for all critical services to be fully ready** before completing deployment.

## Problem Solved

Previously, `cslaunch` would finish immediately after starting containers, but:
- ❌ Redis might still be loading dataset
- ❌ RQ workers might not be registered yet
- ❌ Backend might not be responding
- ❌ Stuck job cleanup would fail with "Redis is loading" errors

## New Behavior

Now `cslaunch`:
1. ✅ Starts/restarts containers
2. ✅ **Waits for Redis to be ready** (not loading)
3. ✅ **Waits for backend health check** to pass
4. ✅ **Waits for RQ workers** to register
5. ✅ Cleans up stuck jobs (safely)
6. ✅ Reports completion when **everything is ready**

## Implementation

### New File: `scripts/wait-for-services.py`

Checks readiness of:
- **Redis**: Pings until ready (not BusyLoadingError)
- **Backend**: Curls health endpoint until 200 OK
- **RQ Workers**: Checks worker registry until at least 1 worker found

Waits up to:
- 60 seconds for Redis
- 30 seconds for backend
- 60 seconds for RQ workers

### Updated Files

**`cslaunch.ps1`** (root):
```powershell
# Before restart
[WAIT] Ensuring services are ready...
  🔍 Waiting for Redis to be ready...
  ✅ Redis is ready
  🔍 Checking backend health...
  ✅ Backend is healthy
  🔍 Waiting for RQ workers to be ready...
  ✅ Found 3 RQ worker(s)

[CLEANUP] Cleaning up any stuck RQ jobs...
  ✅ No stuck jobs found
```

**`scripts/cslaunch.ps1`** (full):
- Added `Wait-ForServices` function
- Calls it before `Clear-StuckJobs`
- Ensures services are ready before cleanup

## Example Output

### Quick Restart
```powershell
./cslaunch

========================================
CaseStrainer Quick Restart (./cslaunch)
========================================

[OK] Found 7 running containers

[WAIT] Ensuring services are ready...
  🔍 Waiting for Redis to be ready...
  ✅ Redis is ready
  🔍 Checking backend health...
  ✅ Backend is healthy
  🔍 Waiting for RQ workers to be ready...
  ✅ Found 3 RQ worker(s): rq:worker:1, rq:worker:2, rq:worker:3

✅ ALL SERVICES READY

[CLEANUP] Cleaning up any stuck RQ jobs...
  🔍 Cleaning jobs older than 10 minutes...
  ✅ No stuck jobs found

[QUICK RESTART] Restarting containers (10-15 seconds)...
[SUCCESS] RESTART COMPLETE in 11.4 seconds!
```

### Full Deployment
```powershell
./cslaunch -Build

=== Starting Production Environment ===

Starting production services...
Production environment is now running!

=== Waiting for services to be ready ===
  🔍 Waiting for Redis to be ready...
  ⏳ Redis loading dataset... (3s)
  ⏳ Redis loading dataset... (5s)
  ✅ Redis is ready
  🔍 Checking backend health...
  ✅ Backend is healthy
  🔍 Waiting for RQ workers to be ready...
  ✅ Found 3 RQ worker(s)

✅ ALL SERVICES READY

=== Cleaning up stuck RQ jobs ===
  ✅ No stuck jobs found
```

## Benefits

✅ **No more "Redis is loading" errors**  
✅ **Stuck job cleanup always succeeds**  
✅ **Guaranteed ready state** before completion  
✅ **Better user experience** - clear status  
✅ **Automatic recovery** - waits for services

## Timeout Behavior

If services don't become ready in time:
- ⚠️ Warning displayed
- ✅ Deployment continues anyway (non-blocking)
- 📝 Status shows which services aren't ready

```
⚠️ Some services not fully ready (deployment will continue)
- Redis: Ready ✅
- Backend: Ready ✅  
- RQ Workers: Not ready ⚠️ (workers may still be starting)
```

## Configuration

Edit timeouts in `scripts/wait-for-services.py`:

```python
wait_for_redis(max_wait=60)      # 60 seconds for Redis
check_backend_health(max_wait=30) # 30 seconds for backend
wait_for_rq_workers(max_wait=60)  # 60 seconds for workers
```

## Testing

Run `cslaunch` - you'll see:
1. Service readiness checks
2. Clear status for each service
3. Stuck job cleanup only runs when safe
4. Completion message when everything is ready

## Files Added/Modified

### ✅ New Files
- `scripts/wait-for-services.py` - Service readiness checker

### ✅ Modified Files
- `cslaunch.ps1` - Added service wait before cleanup
- `scripts/cslaunch.ps1` - Added `Wait-ForServices` function

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ **"Redis is loading" errors** during cleanup
2. ✅ **Premature completion** before services ready
3. ✅ **Failed job cleanup** due to unready services
4. ✅ **Unclear deployment state** - now shows progress

## Next Time You Run cslaunch

You'll see a much more robust deployment:
- Clear progress indicators
- Service-by-service readiness checks
- Guaranteed safe stuck job cleanup
- Confidence that everything is ready

The deployment now **completes only when your system is actually ready to serve requests**!
