CRITICAL FIX: Extract cluster canonical data AFTER verification

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED from worker logs:
- Verification happens AFTER cluster formatting
- My fixes in _format_clusters_for_output() ran before citations were verified
- Result: No verified citations found, no canonical data extracted

SOLUTION: Move canonical data extraction to progress_manager.py
- Happens AFTER verification when citations have canonical data
- Lines 1189-1231 in progress_manager.py

Changes:
1. Extract cluster canonical data from verified citations
2. Set cluster verification_status, canonical_name, canonical_date
3. Propagate canonical data to unverified parallel citations
4. Set true_by_parallel=True for parallels (keep verified=False)

Expected Results:
- Clusters should show "Verifying Source: [Canonical Name]"
- Parallel citations get canonical data with true_by_parallel=True
- Verified parallel citations stay verified=False

Files Modified:
- src/progress_manager.py: Added post-verification canonical data extraction
- ASYNC_ISSUES_TODO.md: Documented root cause and solution
- src/unified_clustering_master.py: Added diagnostic logging (kept for debugging)

Testing: Resubmit PDF to verify clusters now have canonical data
