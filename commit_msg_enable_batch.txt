ENABLE batch citation-lookup verification in clustering

Changed enable_verification from False to True in unified_citation_processor_v2.py line 3791.

This enables the efficient batch citation-lookup API that:
- Processes 50 citations per batch (vs individual calls)
- Returns immediate results with complete cluster data
- Uses resource_uri for proper API endpoints
- Should dramatically improve verification rate

Expected impact:
- More clusters with canonical data
- Faster processing (batch vs individual API calls)
- Better use of API resources
- Proper batch logs (BATCH-API-DEBUG, BATCH-VERIFY-DEBUG) will now appear

Testing: Will upload PDF and verify batch verification is working.
