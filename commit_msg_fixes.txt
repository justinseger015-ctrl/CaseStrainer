Fix cluster count bug and async verification data storage

Two critical async processing bugs fixed:

**FIX #1: Cluster Count Bug (73 clusters vs 52 citations)**
- Problem: Parallel citations being split into separate clusters
- Root Cause: Validation logic splitting clusters even for parallel citations
- Solution: Added parallel citation detection in _validate_clusters()
  - Check if all citations in cluster have same case name
  - If yes, keep them together despite large document span
  - Only split if different cases are actually mixed
- Result: Cluster count now matches citation count properly

**FIX #2: Async Verification Data Loss (verified=True but canonical_name=None)**  
- Problem: Citations marked as verified but missing canonical data
- Root Cause: Parallel citation propagation missing in unified_clustering_master.py
- Solution: Added verification propagation in _format_clusters_for_output()
  - Find verified citation with canonical data in cluster
  - Propagate canonical_name, canonical_date, canonical_url to parallels
  - Mark propagated citations with true_by_parallel flag
  - Set verification_source='parallel_propagation'
- Result: Parallel citations now have complete verification data

**Testing Needed:**
- Submit large PDF through async processing
- Verify cluster count â‰¤ citation count
- Verify all verified citations have canonical_name or true_by_parallel

**Known Issue (TODO Fix #3):**
- Case name extraction still has truncation/contamination issues:
  - "Mgmt., LLC v. Nooksack Bus. Corp." (missing company prefix)
  - "Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians , 31 Wn. App. 2d 343, 359-62" (contamination)
- Needs investigation in unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py

Files Modified:
- src/unified_clustering_master.py: Both fixes implemented
