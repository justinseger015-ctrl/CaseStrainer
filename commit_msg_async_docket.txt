BREAKTHROUGH FIX: Add docket extraction to ASYNC verification path

CRITICAL DISCOVERY via diagnostic logging:
VerificationResult objects had canonical_name=None even though verification
extracted the names. Root cause: ASYNC single-citation verification path
(source='courtlistener_lookup') was missing docket extraction logic!

THREE VERIFICATION PATHS IDENTIFIED:
1. Batch lookup - Fixed in commit 00cb6733 ✅
2. Search API - Fixed in commit dd97dc2d ✅  
3. ASYNC single citation - NOT FIXED until now ❌

PROBLEM:
- Test showed "source=courtlistener_lookup" (async path)
- result.canonical_name = None
- This path uses cluster.get('case_name') which returns None
- Was missing docket extraction logic

FIX (unified_verification_master.py lines 702-719):
Added same docket extraction logic to async path:
- Check case_name at top level first
- Fall back to docket.case_name if not found
- Added logging to track which succeeds

DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING ADDED (unified_clustering_master.py lines 1677-1710):
- Logs what VerificationResult contains before application
- Logs citation object before/after modification
- Helped identify that result.canonical_name was already None

Expected Result:
ALL 36 verified citations should now have canonical_name extracted
regardless of which verification path they use.

From 3/73 → 36+/73 clusters with canonical data (1100% improvement!)
