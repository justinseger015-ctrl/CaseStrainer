CRITICAL FIX: Add docket extraction to search API path

Testing revealed citations were being verified via search_api_fallback,
not batch lookup. My docket extraction fix was only in the batch path,
so search API citations still had no canonical_name.

Fixed: Added same docket extraction logic to search API path
- Checks caseName at top level first (search API uses camelCase)
- Falls back to docket.case_name or docket.caseName if not found
- Handles both snake_case and camelCase field names
- Added logging to track which path succeeds

Lines changed: 1492-1509 in unified_verification_master.py

This should fix the remaining 70/73 clusters that were verified via
search API instead of batch lookup.
