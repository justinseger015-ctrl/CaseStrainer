CRITICAL FIX: Standardize extracted names within clusters to prevent splits

Root cause: Validation step was splitting clusters because citations had
slightly different extracted_case_names due to extraction variations.

Example bug:
- Cluster: [6 Pet. 515, 8 L. Ed. 483] (Worcester v. Georgia parallels)
- Citation 1 extracted: "Worcester v. Georgia"
- Citation 2 extracted: "Worcester v. State of Georgia" 
- Validation saw "2 different extracted names" → SPLIT cluster

Solution: Standardize extracted data within each cluster
- Collect all extracted_case_names from cluster
- Pick BEST one (longest, most complete)
- Propagate to ALL citations in cluster
- Same for extracted_year (most common)

Result: All citations in cluster now have IDENTICAL extracted data
- Validation sees "1 extracted name" → KEEPS cluster intact!
- true_by_parallel will now work (unverified parallels with verified)
- Proper cluster grouping maintained

This follows user's brilliant suggestion to use best extracted data
rather than letting extraction variations break clustering.

Expected: Cluster count drops from ~120 to ~70, true_by_parallel works!
