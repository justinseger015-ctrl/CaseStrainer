A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request.

However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Documen",

A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v.

Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7.

The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contai",

However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id.
