Add detailed logging for true_by_parallel propagation

Added comprehensive logging to trace why true_by_parallel is not being set:
- Logs how many citations checked per cluster
- Logs each citation verified status
- Logs when propagation happens with citation text
- Summary of propagated vs already-verified counts

This will help diagnose if:
1. All citations are already verified (no propagation needed)
2. Citations are dicts vs objects (type handling issue)
3. Propagation code is running but silently failing

Expected: Should see propagation logs for 27 unverified citations that are in clusters with verified parallels.
