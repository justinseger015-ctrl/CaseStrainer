FIX: Add deduplication within clusters to prevent duplicate citations

CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED:
User reported seeing duplicate citations within clusters:
```
📚 Cluster cluster_32: State v. Wallahee, 3 Wn.3d 179, 187-88 (2024)
  Citation 1: 3 Wn.3d 179 - Unverified
  Citation 2: 548 P.3d 200 - Unverified
  Citation 3: 3 Wn.3d 179 - Unverified  ← DUPLICATE!
  Citation 4: 548 P.3d 200 - Unverified  ← DUPLICATE!
```

ROOT CAUSE:
The same citation can appear multiple times in a legal document
(e.g., "3 Wn.3d 179" cited on page 1 and page 10). The extraction
pipeline correctly identifies each instance, they all get grouped
into the same cluster (because they reference the same case), but
there was NO deduplication happening WITHIN each cluster.

CODE LOCATION:
File: src/unified_clustering_master.py
Method: UnifiedClusteringMaster.cluster_citations()
Line: ~1515

The bug was here:
```python
cluster = {
    'cluster_id': f"cluster_{i+1}",
    'cluster_key': cluster_key,
    'citations': citations,  # ← NO DEDUPLICATION!
    'size': len(citations),
    ...
}
```

THE FIX:
1. Added new method: _deduplicate_cluster_citations()
   - Deduplicates by citation text (e.g., "3 Wn.3d 179")
   - Preserves the BEST quality version when duplicates exist
   - Quality preference: verified > unverified, has extracted name > N/A

2. Modified cluster creation to use deduplicated citations:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Deduplicate citations within the cluster
deduplicated_citations = self._deduplicate_cluster_citations(citations)

cluster = {
    'cluster_id': f"cluster_{i+1}",
    'cluster_key': cluster_key,
    'citations': deduplicated_citations,  # ← FIXED!
    'size': len(deduplicated_citations),
    ...
}
```

DEDUPLICATION LOGIC:
- Key: Citation text (unique identifier)
- When duplicates found, keep the better quality one:
  * Verified citation > Unverified citation (+2 points)
  * Has extracted case name > N/A (+1 point)
  * Higher score wins

EXPECTED RESULT:
After fix, cluster_32 should show:
```
📚 Cluster cluster_32: State v. Wallahee, 3 Wn.3d 179, 187-88 (2024)
  Citation 1: 3 Wn.3d 179 - Unverified
  Citation 2: 548 P.3d 200 - Unverified
```

Only 2 citations (not 4), no duplicates!

IMPACT:
- Cleaner cluster display
- Accurate citation counts
- Better user experience
- Prevents confusion about duplicate citations

This fix addresses the first critical issue from the user's debug request.
The other issues (N/A case names, missing verified parallels) are separate
bugs that need investigation.
