CRITICAL FIX: Preserve verification status from clusters (was being overwritten)

Root cause: progress_manager was REPLACING updated citations from clusters 
with OLD unverified citations from citation_dicts, losing all verification updates!

The Bug:
1. Batch verification in clustering sets: verified=False for 584 U.S. 554
2. Citations are updated in clusters correctly  
3. progress_manager receives clusters with updated citations
4. But lines 1153-1186 REPLACED them with old citations from citation_dicts
5. Result: verified=False becomes verified=True again!
6. Propagation sees "all verified" and does nothing

The Fix:
- REMOVED the citation replacement logic
- Now we PRESERVE citations from clusters (they have latest verification data)
- Only convert citation objects to dicts without changing data
- Include all fields: verified, verification_error, true_by_parallel, etc.

Why This Matters:
- Without this fix, verified=False updates are lost
- Propagation check always sees verified=True
- true_by_parallel never triggers
- Unverified parallel citations don't get canonical data

Expected Result After Fix:
- Unverified citations stay verified=False
- Propagation sees mixed status: some True, some False  
- Copies canonical data to verified=False citations
- Sets true_by_parallel=True on those citations
- Canonical data coverage increases to 90%+

This is THE critical fix that enables true_by_parallel functionality!
