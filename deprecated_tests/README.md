# Deprecated Tests

This directory contains test files that have been deprecated in favor of the integrated testing functionality in start_casestrainer.bat.

## Why were these tests deprecated?

- The functionality of these tests has been integrated into the main start_casestrainer.bat script
- The new implementation provides better error handling and logging
- Centralized testing makes it easier to maintain and update tests

## How to run tests now

Simply run start_casestrainer.bat and the integrated tests will run automatically after the services start.
