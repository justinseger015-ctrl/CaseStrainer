CRITICAL BUGFIXES: Fix case name bleeding in clean_extraction_pipeline

BUGS DISCOVERED DURING TESTING:
================================

Bug 1: all_citations parameter was None
----------------------------------------
Location: clean_extraction_pipeline.py line 314
Impact: Strict context isolator couldn't identify citation boundaries
Result: Neutral citations bleeding into other citations' case names

Fix: Pass full citations list to extract_case_name_with_strict_isolation()
so boundary detection works properly.

Bug 2: Eyecite case names not cleaned
--------------------------------------
Location: _clean_eyecite_case_name() function
Impact: Eyecite extracted case names like "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of 
San Felipe, 2017-NM-007" with embedded citations
Result: Case name bleeding from eyecite extractions

Fix: Added citation removal patterns to _clean_eyecite_case_name():
- Neutral citations (2017-NM-007, 2020 ND 45)
- Standard reporters (P.3d, U.S., F.3d, etc.)
- All citation formats cleaned from eyecite case names

TESTING RESULTS:
================

Created comprehensive test suite (test_phase1_extraction.py):
✅ Pattern matching: All 39 patterns working
✅ Neutral citation extraction: 2017-NM-007, 2020 ND 45 extracted
✅ Case name bleeding: ZERO issues (was 1, now 0)
✅ Both neutral and regional citations extracted separately
✅ Case names clean (no embedded citations)

Test Document Results:
- 11 citations extracted total
- 2 neutral citations found
- 0 case name bleeding issues
- Ready for clustering

IMPACT:
=======

These fixes complete the neutral citation support:
1. ✅ Neutral citations extracted as separate citations
2. ✅ Neutral citations recognized as citation boundaries
3. ✅ Case names clean (no citation contamination)
4. ✅ Ready for parallel citation clustering

The combination of:
- Shared citation patterns (Phase 1 consolidation)
- Proper boundary detection (this fix)
- Citation cleaning (this fix)

...means the system now correctly handles neutral citations like 2017-NM-007.

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
- src/clean_extraction_pipeline.py: Two critical bug fixes
- test_phase1_extraction.py: Comprehensive test suite (added)

DEPLOYMENT:
===========
This fix is CRITICAL and should be deployed with Phase 1 consolidation.
Both changes work together to solve the neutral citation issue.
