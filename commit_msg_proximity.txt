Add proximity detection diagnostics to find clustering split bug

Added detailed logging to validation step to diagnose why proximity detection fails:
- Logs when clusters have citations but no positions
- Shows citation type and available attributes/keys  
- Logs proximity calculations when positions exist
- Warns when positions are missing

This will reveal if citations lose start_index data after batch verification.

Expected: Should show either:
1. Citations missing start_index (data loss bug)
2. Positions found but distance > 200 (threshold too strict)
3. Proximity override working but splits happen anyway (downstream bug)
