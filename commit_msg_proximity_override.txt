CRITICAL FIX: Proximity override for P5_FIX validation

Root cause: P5_FIX was splitting CORRECT parallel citations because it checked
for "mixed federal/state reporters" and other rules that don't apply to parallels.

Example failures:
- "584 U.S. 554, 200 L. Ed. 2d 931, 138 S. Ct. 1649" → Split apart
- Reason: "Mixed federal and state reporters (cannot be parallel)"
- BUT THESE ARE PARALLEL CITATIONS! (Supreme Court case with 3 reporters)

Solution: Check proximity FIRST
- If citations within 200 chars → SKIP P5_FIX (definitely parallel)  
- If citations far apart → APPLY P5_FIX (might be false clustering)

This preserves true parallel citations while still catching false clustering.

Expected result: 
- Cluster count drops from ~120 to ~70
- Parallel citations stay grouped
- true_by_parallel works (unverified with verified in same cluster)

This is the final piece needed for proper clustering!
