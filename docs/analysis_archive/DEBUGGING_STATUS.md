# Debugging Status: After FIX #44

## üéØ Goal
Extract "148 Wn.2d 224" and "59 P.3d 655" (Fraternal Order case)

## ‚úÖ Progress Made

### FIX #43 (Previous Session)
- Fixed text normalization position mismatch
- "183 Wn.2d 649" now extracts correctly ‚úÖ

### FIX #44 (Current Session)
- Added text normalization BEFORE extraction
- Standalone test: ‚úÖ WORKS (recovered 2 citations)
- Production test: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (eyecite finds 99 vs ~40, but target still missing)

## üìä Current Status

### Logs Show:
```
Text normalized: 66655 ‚Üí 64380 chars ‚úÖ
Regex found: 81 citations
Eyecite found: 99 citations ‚úÖ (huge improvement!)
After deduplication: 88 citations
```

### Results Show:
- Total citations: 88 (was 87, so +1)
- "148 Wn.2d 224": ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- "59 P.3d 655": ‚ùå NOT FOUND
- "Fraternal": ‚ùå NOT FOUND

## üîç Possible Causes

### Theory 1: PDF Extraction Issues
- PyPDF2 extracts: "148 Wn.2d  \n224" (line break)
- Our test used: Same text with line break
- But maybe the REAL PDF text has different encoding/characters?

### Theory 2: Deduplication Filter
- Eyecite finds 99 ‚Üí dedups to 88 = 11 removed
- Maybe "148 Wn.2d 224" is being seen as duplicate of something else?
- Or filtered as invalid?

### Theory 3: Different Code Path
- PDF extraction might normalize text BEFORE passing to processor
- Or use a different extraction method entirely
- Need to trace actual PDF processing path

### Theory 4: Eyecite Normalization
- Eyecite normalizes "Wn.2d" ‚Üí "Wash.2d"
- Maybe it's extracting as "148 Wash. 2d 224"?
- But our search for "Wash" also found nothing

## üß™ Next Steps to Debug

###  1. Check PDF Extraction Layer
```python
# What does PyPDF2 ACTUALLY give us for this citation?
import PyPDF2
reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader('1033940.pdf')
text = ''.join([page.extract_text() for p in reader.pages])
# Find exact bytes around position 25344
print(repr(text[25300:25400]))
```

### 2. Add Logging to Deduplication
```python
# In _deduplicate_citations, log what's being removed
logger.info(f"Removing duplicate: {citation.citation}")
```

### 3. Check Eyecite Raw Output
```python
# Log ALL 99 citations eyecite finds
for cite in eyecite_citations:
    logger.info(f"Eyecite found: {cite.citation}")
```

### 4. Search by Position, Not Text
```python
# "148 Wn.2d 224" is at position ~25344
# Check if ANY citation has start_index near 25344
for cite in citations:
    if 25300 < cite.start_index < 25400:
        logger.info(f"Citation near 25344: {cite.citation}")
```

## üí° User's Key Insight

**"I thought we stripped out linebreaks..."**

You were RIGHT! We SHOULD have been normalizing. The bug was that normalization existed but wasn't applied before extraction.

FIX #44 added normalization in the right place, and eyecite extraction jumped from ~40 to 99 citations - clear evidence it's working!

But the specific citations "148 Wn.2d 224" and "59 P.3d 655" are still missing, suggesting a secondary issue (deduplication, filtering, or PDF extraction artifact).

## üéØ Recommendation

**Need user to provide frontend JSON output** to see:
1. All 88 citations with positions
2. Check if any citation is near position 25344
3. Identify what's being extracted instead of "148 Wn.2d 224"

Or I can add more aggressive logging and restart to trace exactly what's happening to these specific citations.
