# Test Results Summary - FIX #44

## Test Execution

**Command:** `python quick_test.py` (using cslaunch production environment)  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Document:** 1033940.pdf  
**Results File:** `test_post_fix44.json`

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ FIX #44 Is Working

**Evidence from logs:**
```
[UNIFIED_EXTRACTION] FIX #44: Normalizing text before extraction
[UNIFIED_EXTRACTION] Text normalized: 66655 ‚Üí 64380 chars
[UNIFIED_EXTRACTION] Regex found 81 citations
[UNIFIED_EXTRACTION] Eyecite found 99 citations
[UNIFIED_EXTRACTION] After deduplication: 88 citations
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Text normalization: ‚úÖ Active (line breaks collapsed)
- Eyecite improvement: ‚úÖ 99 citations (was ~40, +147% increase!)
- No regression: ‚úÖ Previous fixes (like #43) still working

### ‚ùå New Problem Discovered: Deduplication Bottleneck

**The Issue:**
- Eyecite finds 99 citations (+59 vs before)
- Deduplication removes 11 citations
- Final result: 88 citations (+1 vs before)

**Net Impact:** Only +1 citation despite eyecite finding 59 more!

### üî¥ Critical Missing Citations

**"148 Wn.2d 224" and "59 P.3d 655" (Fraternal Order)**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed in PDF at positions 25321 and 25343
- ‚ùå Not in API results
- ü§î Likely extracted by eyecite but removed by deduplication

**Other Missing:**
- "182 Wn.2d 342" - Not in results
- "9 P.3d 655" - Not in results  
- "199 Wn.2d 528" - Not in results
- Many parallel pairs missing

## Statistics

| Metric | Before FIX #44 | After FIX #44 | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **Eyecite Extraction** | ~40 | 99 | +147% ‚úÖ |
| **Total Citations** | 87 | 88 | +1 ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Clusters** | 57 | 57 | 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Deduplication** | N/A | -11 | üî¥ |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem:** Deduplication is too aggressive

**Theory:** The `_deduplicate_citations` function is:
1. Removing citations that eyecite normalizes differently (Wn.2d ‚Üí Wash.2d)
2. Using overly strict matching criteria
3. Position-based collision after line break removal

**Evidence:**
- 11 citations removed = 11% of eyecite findings
- Known PDF citations not in results
- Eyecite improvement (+59) doesn't translate to results (+1)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Debug Deduplication)

1. **Add logging to see what's being removed:**
   ```python
   # In _deduplicate_citations
   logger.warning(f"DEDUP: Removing '{citation.citation}' (duplicate of '{primary.citation}')")
   ```

2. **Log all 99 eyecite citations before dedup:**
   ```python
   for cite in eyecite_citations:
       logger.info(f"EYECITE: {cite.citation} at pos {cite.start_index}")
   ```

3. **Test hypothesis:** Check if "148 Wash. 2d 224" is in the 99

### Short Term (Fix)

Improve deduplication logic to:
- Use position + similarity instead of exact text match
- Handle reporter abbreviation variations (Wn.2d vs Wash.2d)
- Be less aggressive (only remove true duplicates)

### Long Term (Architecture)

- Store both normalized and original citation text
- Add deduplication metrics/alerts
- Unit test for specific problematic citations

## Conclusion

**FIX #44:** ‚úÖ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**

The fix successfully enables eyecite to find many more citations (+147%), proving text normalization is working. However, a deduplication bottleneck prevents these citations from reaching the final results.

**Priority:** Fix the `_deduplicate_citations` function to preserve valid citations that eyecite is now finding.

**Impact:** High - Without fixing deduplication, FIX #44's benefits are mostly lost.
