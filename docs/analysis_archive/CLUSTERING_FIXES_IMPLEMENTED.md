# Clustering Fixes Implemented

## Date: 2025-10-09

## Problem Summary
The system was incorrectly grouping **four different cases** into a single cluster, showing:
- Citations 27,000+ characters apart being grouped together
- Contaminated case names (showing parenthetical citations instead of actual case names)
- "Phantom" citations not properly extracted locally

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Proximity Check Bypass Bug** (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `src/unified_clustering_master.py`, lines 515-525 (before fix)

**Issue**: The case name similarity check happened BEFORE the proximity check, allowing citations with similar names to be grouped even if they were thousands of characters apart.

```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
if similarity >= 0.8:
    return True  # ❌ Returns without checking proximity!

# Proximity check happens later, but too late
if distance > proximity_threshold:
    return False
```

**Fix**: Moved proximity check to happen FIRST before any other heuristics:

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
# Check proximity FIRST
if distance > proximity_threshold:
    return False  # ✅ Reject immediately if too far apart

# THEN check patterns and case name similarity
# (only if citations are already close together)
if similarity >= 0.8:
    return True
```

**Impact**: Prevents citations >200 chars apart from being clustered together, regardless of name similarity.

### 2. **Missing Cluster Validation**
**Location**: `src/unified_clustering_master.py`, added lines 1323-1453

**Issue**: No validation step to catch incorrectly grouped citations that slipped through.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive cluster validation that:
1. Checks if all citations in a cluster are within reasonable proximity
2. Splits clusters if span exceeds 10x the proximity threshold (2000 chars)
3. Logs warnings for suspicious clusters
4. Automatically splits overly large clusters into proper subclusters

```python
def _validate_clusters(self, clusters, original_text):
    """
    Validate cluster integrity:
    - Check citation span doesn't exceed 10x proximity threshold
    - Split clusters that are too large
    - Log warnings for debugging
    """
    # If span > 2000 chars (10x threshold), split the cluster
    if span > max_allowed_span:
        split_clusters = self._split_cluster_by_proximity(...)
        return split_clusters
```

**Impact**: Catches and fixes any remaining clustering errors as a safety net.

### 3. **Missing WL Citation Patterns**
**Location**: `src/services/citation_extractor.py`, lines 172-176

**Issue**: Westlaw (WL) citations like "2024 WL 4678268" were not being extracted by the local regex patterns. They were only extracted when eyecite was enabled, leading to inconsistent behavior.

**Fix**: Added WL citation pattern to the regex extractor:

```python
# Add Westlaw (WL) citation patterns
# Format: YYYY WL #######
wl_pattern = r'\b(\d{4}\s+WL\s+\d+)\b'
all_patterns.append(wl_pattern)
```

**Impact**: WL citations are now consistently extracted, even without eyecite.

---

## Testing Performed

### Before Fix (from diagnostic scripts):
- **Local clustering**: 61 clusters (correct - without WL citations)
- **Production**: 4 different cases incorrectly grouped into 1 cluster

### After Fix (expected):
- Citations >27,000 chars apart will be rejected during parallel check
- Suspicious clusters will be automatically split
- WL citations will be extracted locally
- Each case will be in its own cluster

## Files Modified

1. **`src/unified_clustering_master.py`**
   - Lines 506-578: Reordered proximity check before case name similarity
   - Lines 271-274: Added validation step
   - Lines 1323-1453: Added `_validate_clusters()` and `_split_cluster_by_proximity()` methods

2. **`src/services/citation_extractor.py`**
   - Lines 172-176: Added WL citation pattern

---

## Verification Steps

To verify these fixes work:

1. **Restart the production environment**:
   ```bash
   ./cslaunch
   ```

2. **Process document 1033940.pdf** and check that:
   - "199 Wn.2d 528" (State v. M.Y.G.) is in its own cluster
   - "2024 WL 4678268" (Wright v. HP Inc.) is in its own cluster  
   - "2024 WL 3199858" and "2024 WL 2133370" (Floyd v. Insight Glob. LLC) are together
   - No cluster shows "Association" in extracted_case_name
   - No cluster spans >2000 characters

3. **Check logs** for:
   - `PARALLEL_CHECK rejected by proximity` messages
   - `CLUSTER_VALIDATION` messages showing splits
   - WL citations being extracted

---

## Additional Improvements Needed

These fixes address the immediate clustering bug, but further improvements could include:

1. **Case Name Extraction Enhancement**: Better handling of parenthetical citations to avoid capturing them as main case names

2. **Reporter Normalization**: Ensure "Wn.2d" and "Wash.2d" are treated consistently

3. **Adaptive Learning**: Feed clustering errors back into the system to improve future accuracy

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**User Impact**: HIGH - Users were seeing completely incorrect clustering results

**Fix Confidence**: HIGH
- Fixes address the root causes identified through systematic analysis
- Added defensive validation layer as safety net
- Logging added for future debugging

**Regression Risk**: LOW
- Changes are defensive (more restrictive clustering)
- Validation only splits obviously bad clusters
- WL pattern addition is purely additive
