# Case Name Extraction Fix - Status Report

## Problem
Case names were bleeding between citations. When citations appeared close together, the extractor would pick up the wrong case name.

Example:
- **506 U.S. 139** was extracting "Will v. Hallock" instead of "P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc."
- **830 F.3d 881** was extracting "Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc." instead of "Manzari v. Associated Newspapers Ltd."

## Root Cause
The extraction algorithm was looking at too broad a context and not properly isolating the text that immediately precedes each citation.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Strict Context Isolator (`src/utils/strict_context_isolator.py`)
- Finds ALL citation positions in the document
- For each citation, isolates ONLY the text immediately before it
- Stops at the nearest previous citation boundary
- Removes contamination prefixes ("quoting", "citing", "relies on", etc.)

### 2. Integrated into Primary Extraction Path (`src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py`)
- Made strict context isolation the PRIMARY extraction method (line 1279)
- Validates extracted names have proper structure (contains " v. ")
- Minimum length requirements adjusted to 5 characters

### 3. Created Data Separation Enforcement (`src/utils/data_separation.py`)
- Ensures extracted_date contains only years (not full ISO dates)
- Cleans contamination from extracted case names
- Enforces strict separation between extracted and canonical data

### 4. Fixed Clustering Keys (`src/utils/clustering_utils.py`)
- Clustering now uses ONLY extracted data, never canonical data
- Prevents over-clustering (62 clusters for 88 citations)

## Test Results (24-2626.pdf)
Using validation script with 20 known correct citations:

### Before Fixes:
- Accuracy: 25% (5/20 correct)
- Many cases of case name bleeding

### Current Status:
Testing in progress with refined parameters...

## Files Modified:
1. `src/utils/strict_context_isolator.py` - NEW
2. `src/utils/data_separation.py` - NEW
3. `src/utils/clustering_utils.py` - NEW
4. `src/utils/extraction_cleaner.py` - NEW
5. `src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py` - Modified extraction logic
6. `src/services/citation_clusterer.py` - Fixed clustering keys
7. `src/unified_citation_clustering.py` - Fixed clustering keys
8. `src/enhanced_sync_processor.py` - Added data separation enforcement
9. `src/unified_sync_processor.py` - Added data separation enforcement

## Next Steps:
1. Fine-tune extraction patterns in strict_context_isolator.py
2. Lower minimum length requirements if needed
3. Add more test cases to validate improvements
4. Deploy to production once validation passes

## Known Issues:
- Some extractions still returning "N/A" - patterns may need refinement
- Minimum length threshold needs adjustment
- Pattern matching coverage needs improvement for edge cases
