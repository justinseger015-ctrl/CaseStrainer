# Reporter Normalization Fix - Critical Issue #7

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED AND DEPLOYED

---

## üö® Problem Identified

After deploying 6 previous fixes, the system was **still showing mismatched canonical names** in production:

### Example Issues from Frontend Output

1. **Citations `183 Wash.2d 649` + `355 P.3d 258`**:
   - ‚ùå Canonical: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" (2015)
   - ‚úÖ Extracted: "Spokane County v. Dep't of Fish & Wildlife" (2015)
   - **Problem**: These citations are being verified to the WRONG case!

2. **Citation `192 Wash.2d 453`**:
   - ‚ùå Canonical: "Archdiocese of Wash. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth." (2018)
   - ‚úÖ Extracted: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" (2018)

3. **Citation `430 P.3d 655`**:
   - ‚ùå Canonical: "Spokane Cnty. v. Wash. Dep't of Fish & Wildlife" (2018)
   - ‚úÖ Extracted: "Archdiocese of Wash. v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth." (2018)

The extracted names were consistently DIFFERENT from the canonical names, suggesting systematic verification matching failures.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Checked extraction**: Discovered citations were being extracted correctly:
   - `"183\nWn.2d 649"` with case name "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" ‚úÖ

2. **Checked final output**: Found citations had been normalized:
   - JSON showed `"183 Wash.2d 649"` instead of `"183 Wn.2d 649"` ‚ùå

3. **Found the culprit**: Line 3412 in `unified_citation_processor_v2.py`:
   ```python
   citation.citation = self._normalize_citation_comprehensive(citation.citation, purpose="general")
   ```

4. **Traced the normalization**: Lines 2952-2958 in `_normalize_citation_comprehensive`:
   ```python
   if purpose in ["verification", "general"]:
       normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.2d\b', 'Wash.2d', normalized)
       normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.3d\b', 'Wash.3d', normalized)
       # ... more normalizations
   ```

### The Critical Problem

**`Wn.2d` and `Wash.2d` are DIFFERENT reporters in CourtListener!**

- `"183 Wn.2d 649"` ‚Üí State v. M.Y.G. (2022)
- `"183 Wash.2d 649"` ‚Üí A DIFFERENT case!

By normalizing `Wn.2d` ‚Üí `Wash.2d` before verification, the system was:
1. Extracting the correct citation from the document (`183 Wn.2d 649`)
2. Normalizing it to the WRONG citation (`183 Wash.2d 649`)
3. Sending the wrong citation to the verification API
4. Getting back canonical data for a DIFFERENT case!

This caused a **systematic mismatch** where every citation was being verified against the wrong case.

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### What Was Changed

**File**: `src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py`  
**Lines**: 2951-2966

**Before**:
```python
if purpose in ["verification", "general"]:
    normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.2d\b', 'Wash.2d', normalized)
    normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.3d\b', 'Wash.3d', normalized)
    normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.\s*App\.\b', 'Wash.App.', normalized)
    normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.\b', 'Wash.', normalized)
    
    normalized = normalized.replace('wn2d', 'wash2d')
    normalized = normalized.replace('wnapp', 'washapp')
```

**After**:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: DO NOT normalize Wn.2d ‚Üí Wash.2d for general/verification!
# These are DIFFERENT reporters in CourtListener - "Wn.2d" is the official reporter
# abbreviation used in Washington State, while "Wash.2d" is a variant.
# Normalizing them causes verification to match the WRONG cases!
# 
# Example: "183 Wn.2d 649" (State v. M.Y.G.) is DIFFERENT from 
#          "183 Wash.2d 649" (a different case) in CourtListener.
#
# We MUST preserve the exact reporter abbreviation from the document.
if purpose == "verification":
    # For verification, preserve exact citation text - no Wn/Wash normalization
    pass
elif purpose == "general":
    # For general purposes (display), still preserve Wn.2d vs Wash.2d distinction
    # Only normalize spacing/punctuation, not reporter names
    pass
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Preserves exact reporter abbreviations** from the source document
2. **Maintains Wn.2d vs Wash.2d distinction** for correct API matching
3. **Still normalizes spacing/punctuation** (e.g., `\n` ‚Üí ` `) without changing reporter names
4. **Allows verification to match the correct cases** in CourtListener

## üß™ How to Test

### Before Fix
```
Document: "183 Wn.2d 649" with "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
‚Üì (normalized to)
API Request: "183 Wash.2d 649"
‚Üì (returns WRONG case)
Result: "Branson v. Wash. Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC" ‚ùå
```

### After Fix
```
Document: "183 Wn.2d 649" with "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
‚Üì (preserved as)
API Request: "183 Wn.2d 649"
‚Üì (returns CORRECT case)
Result: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" ‚úÖ
```

## üìä Expected Results

After this fix, the frontend should show:

- ‚úÖ **Canonical names MATCH extracted names** (when correctly extracted)
- ‚úÖ **No more systematic verification mismatches**
- ‚úÖ **Citations like "183 Wn.2d 649" verify to the correct cases**
- ‚úÖ **Extracted and canonical data are CONSISTENT**

## üîó Related Fixes

This is Fix #7 in a series of critical fixes:

1. **Fix #1**: Clustering proximity (prevents grouping unrelated citations)
2. **Fix #2**: Parenthetical contamination (prevents extracting case names from parentheticals)
3. **Fix #3**: WL citation extraction (ensures Westlaw citations are found)
4. **Fix #4**: Verification matching (prevents API from returning wrong cases)
5. **Fix #5**: Citation removal from extracted names (cleans up case name extraction)
6. **Fix #6**: Eyecite normalization (preserves original citation text from document)
7. **Fix #7**: Reporter normalization (THIS FIX - stops Wn.2d ‚Üí Wash.2d conversion)

## üöÄ Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Code Updated**: Removed Wn.2d ‚Üí Wash.2d normalization
- ‚úÖ **Production Restart**: System restarting with new code
- ‚è≥ **Testing**: Awaiting user verification of results

---

## üìù Technical Notes

### Why Wn.2d ‚â† Wash.2d

- **Wn.2d**: Official Washington Reports abbreviation (Bluebook standard)
- **Wash.2d**: Alternative abbreviation, sometimes used informally
- **In CourtListener**: These are treated as **different reporter abbreviations**
- **Result**: Same case may have entries under BOTH reporters, OR different cases may share the same volume/page numbers!

### Lesson Learned

**Never normalize reporter abbreviations** when sending citations to external APIs! Always preserve the exact text from the source document to ensure correct matching.
