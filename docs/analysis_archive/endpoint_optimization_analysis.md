# Frontend Endpoint Optimization Analysis

## Current Situation
The frontend is currently using `/analyze` for ALL requests, but `/analyze_enhanced` is strictly better for text-based citation verification.

## Endpoint Capabilities Comparison

### `/analyze` (Standard)
- ✅ File uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- ✅ JSON text input
- ✅ Form data input
- ✅ URL processing
- ✅ Sync and async processing
- ❌ Uses older verification logic (false positives)
- ❌ Less accurate citation verification
- ❌ No enhanced metadata/confidence scoring

### `/analyze_enhanced` (Enhanced)
- ❌ No file upload support
- ✅ JSON text input only
- ❌ No form data input
- ❌ No URL processing
- ✅ Sync and async processing
- ✅ Enhanced cross-validation verification
- ✅ Better false positive prevention
- ✅ Enhanced metadata and confidence scoring

## Optimal Strategy

### Use `/analyze_enhanced` for:
- ✅ Text input (pasted text, typed text)
- ✅ Small text snippets (sync processing)
- ✅ Large text blocks (async processing)
- ✅ Any JSON-based text analysis

### Use `/analyze` for:
- ✅ File uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT files)
- ✅ URL processing
- ✅ Form data submissions
- ✅ Legacy compatibility

## Implementation Plan

1. **Smart Endpoint Selection**: Frontend chooses endpoint based on input type
2. **Fallback Strategy**: If enhanced fails, fall back to standard
3. **Consistent Interface**: Same response format for both endpoints
4. **Performance Optimization**: Use enhanced for text, standard for files

## Benefits
- ✅ Better verification accuracy for text input (majority of use cases)
- ✅ Enhanced metadata and confidence scoring
- ✅ False positive prevention
- ✅ Maintains full functionality for file uploads
- ✅ Backward compatibility
