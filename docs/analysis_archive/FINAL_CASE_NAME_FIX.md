# Final Case Name Extraction Fix - Complete ✅

## Date
October 8, 2025

## Problem Summary
The case name extraction for "Ass'n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd." was:
1. **Previously truncated to**: "Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd." (missing "Ass'n of Wash.")
2. **Root cause**: The smart quote character `'` (U+2019) in "Ass'n" was not included in the regex character class

## Root Cause Analysis

### Character Encoding Issue
The PDF text contains:
```
Ass'n of Wash.
Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd.
```

Where the apostrophe in "Ass'n" is **U+2019** (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK / smart quote), NOT the ASCII apostrophe **U+0027**.

### Pattern Mismatch
The original pattern was:
```python
party_pattern = r'[A-Z][\w\s&,\.\'\-]+'
```

The `\'` only matches ASCII apostrophe (U+0027), so it could NOT match the smart quote (U+2019) in "Ass'n". This caused the pattern to skip over "Ass'n of Wash." and start matching from "Wash." or "Spirits" instead.

## Solution

### Fix Applied
Updated the pattern in `src/services/citation_extractor.py` (line 291):
```python
# BEFORE:
party_pattern = r'[A-Z][\w\s&,\.\'\-]+'

# AFTER:
party_pattern = r'[A-Z][\w\s&,\.\'\u2019\-]+'
```

Added `\u2019` to the character class to match smart quotes in addition to regular apostrophes.

### Additional Improvements
1. **Abbreviation Detection** (lines 553-562): Added logic to detect abbreviated words (Ass'n, Dep't, etc.) and location abbreviations (Wash., Cal., etc.) to prevent incorrect cleaning
2. **Smart Cleaning Logic** (lines 564-571): Only remove sentence fragments if no abbreviations are detected in the first 60 characters
3. **Unicode Support** (line 291): Use `\w` with `re.UNICODE` flag to match unicode characters
4. **Greedy Matching** (line 291): Use greedy `+` quantifier to capture full case names including abbreviated words

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Test (1033940.pdf)
```
Citation: 182 Wn.2d 342
Extracted: Ass'n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd.
Canonical: None
Status: ✅ PASS - No contamination in extracted_case_name
```

### Key Achievements
1. ✅ **Full Case Name Captured**: "Ass'n of Wash." is now included in the extracted name
2. ✅ **No Contamination**: The extracted field contains ONLY text from the user's document
3. ✅ **Data Separation**: Canonical data (from API) is properly separated from extracted data
4. ✅ **Unicode Handling**: Smart quotes, special characters (Æ, é, etc.) are properly handled

## Files Modified

## Technical Notes

### Unicode Characters in Legal Text
Common unicode characters in legal documents:
- `'` (U+2019) - Right single quotation mark / smart quote (most common in PDFs)
- `'` (U+0027) - ASCII apostrophe
- `"` (U+201C) - Left double quotation mark
- `"` (U+201D) - Right double quotation mark
- `—` (U+2014) - Em dash
- `–` (U+2013) - En dash

The regex patterns must account for these unicode variations, especially in:
- Abbreviated words: Ass'n, Dep't, Gov't, Int'l
- Possessives: Court's, State's
- Contractions: don't, won't

### Pattern Design Considerations
1. **Greedy vs Non-Greedy**: Use greedy `+` for first party name to capture full abbreviations
2. **Character Class**: Must include both ASCII and unicode variants of punctuation
3. **Lookaheads**: Use `(?=\s*,|\s*\d)` to stop at citation start without consuming it
4. **Unicode Flag**: Always use `re.UNICODE` flag for international character support

## Status
**COMPLETE** ✅ - All issues resolved, tests passing
