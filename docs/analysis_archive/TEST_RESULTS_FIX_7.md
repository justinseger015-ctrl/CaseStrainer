# Fix #7 Test Results - Reporter Normalization

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Test Subject**: 1033940.pdf  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **LOCAL TESTS PASS - PRODUCTION VERIFICATION NEEDED**

---

## üìä Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING

1. **Citation Text Preservation** ‚úÖ
   - Found **34 citations with `Wn.2d` preserved**
   - Citations are NO LONGER being converted from `Wn.2d` ‚Üí `Wash.2d`
   - Example: `"183 Wn.2d 649"` stays as `"183 Wn.2d 649"` (not changed to `"183 Wash.2d 649"`)

2. **Extraction** ‚úÖ
   - 92/92 citations extracted with case names
   - Key citations identified correctly:
     - `183 Wn.2d 649` ‚Üí "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" ‚úÖ
     - `192 Wn.2d 453` ‚Üí Correct citation format preserved ‚úÖ
     - `355 P.3d 258` ‚Üí Extracted correctly ‚úÖ

3. **Clustering** ‚úÖ
   - 37 clusters created (average 2.5 citations/cluster)
   - Parallel citations grouped together correctly

## üéØ Expected Production Results

With the fix deployed, **production verification should now show**:

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
Citation: "183 Wash.2d 649" (WRONG - normalized)
Canonical: "Branson v. Wash. Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC"
Extracted: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
Result: MISMATCH ‚ùå
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
Citation: "183 Wn.2d 649" (CORRECT - preserved)
Canonical: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
Extracted: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
Result: MATCH ‚úÖ
```

## üîç What to Check in Production

Please test with `1033940.pdf` in production and check:

### 1. Citation Text Format
- [ ] Citations show `"Wn.2d"` (NOT `"Wash.2d"`)
- [ ] Example: Look for `"183 Wn.2d 649"` in the output

### 2. Name Matching
- [ ] **Canonical names MATCH extracted names** for the same citation
- [ ] Example: `"183 Wn.2d 649"` should show:
  - Canonical: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
  - Extracted: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"

### 3. Key Test Cases

| Citation | Expected Canonical | Expected Extracted | Should Match? |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| `183 Wn.2d 649` | Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms | Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms | ‚úÖ YES |
| `355 P.3d 258` | Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms | Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms | ‚úÖ YES |
| `192 Wn.2d 453` | Archdiocese of Wash. v. Wash. Metro... | Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms | ‚ùå NO (different cases in same paragraph) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

**Local testing cannot verify API matching** - We can only test:
- ‚úÖ Citation text preservation (Wn.2d vs Wash.2d)
- ‚úÖ Extraction accuracy
- ‚úÖ Clustering logic

**Production testing required for**:
- ‚è≥ CourtListener API verification matching
- ‚è≥ Canonical name accuracy
- ‚è≥ Full end-to-end results

---

## üìù What Changed

**File**: `src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py`  
**Lines**: 2951-2966

**Removed**:
```python
if purpose in ["verification", "general"]:
    normalized = re.sub(r'\bWn\.2d\b', 'Wash.2d', normalized)  # ‚ùå REMOVED
    # ... more normalizations that were breaking verification
```

**Result**: Citations now preserve the **exact reporter abbreviation** from the document, allowing CourtListener API to match the correct cases.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test in production** with `1033940.pdf`
2. **Check the frontend output** for:
   - Citation text format (`Wn.2d` vs `Wash.2d`)
   - Canonical vs Extracted name matching
3. **Report results** - any remaining mismatches

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**Local tests confirm the fix is working!** Citations now preserve `Wn.2d` format, which should allow correct verification matching in production.

**Production verification is needed** to confirm the full end-to-end fix works with the CourtListener API.

üéâ **This fix should resolve the systematic canonical/extracted name mismatches!**
