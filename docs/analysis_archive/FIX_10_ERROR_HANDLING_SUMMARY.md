# Critical Fix #10: Proper Error Handling in Cluster Canonical Data

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

---

## üö® **Problem Identified After Fix #9**

After deploying Fix #9 (API Response Structure), the system **still showed canonical data for 404 citations**!

### **Diagnostic Results**

Direct API testing revealed:
- **"9 P.3d 655"**: API returns `404 - Citation not found` ‚ùå
- **"192 Wn.2d 453"**: API returns `404 - Citation not found` ‚ùå

But the JSON output showed:
- **"9 P.3d 655"**: Canonical data for "Fraternal Order of Eagles" with Mississippi URL ‚ùå
- **"192 Wn.2d 453"**: Canonical data for "Lopez Demetrio" with Pullar URL ‚ùå

---

## üéØ **Root Cause Discovered**

The verification code **correctly handles 404 responses** (lines 319-323 in `unified_verification_master.py`):
```python
if status_code == 404 or not clusters_for_citation:
    logger.debug(f"Citation '{citation}' returned 404 or no clusters: {error_message}")
    results.append(VerificationResult(citation=citation, error=error_message or "Citation not found"))
    continue
```

**But** the cluster formatting code in `unified_citation_processor_v2.py` was **ignoring the error field**!

### **The Contamination Chain**

1. Citation `"9 P.3d 655"` ‚Üí Verification returns 404 with `error="Citation not found"` ‚úì
2. Citation clustered with `"59 P.3d 655"` ‚Üí Verified successfully with canonical data ‚úì
3. Cluster formatting code (Fix #8):
   ```python
   if cit.get('verified'):  # ‚ùå BUG: Doesn't check for errors!
       if not canonical_name:
           canonical_name = cit.get('canonical_name')
   ```
4. **Result**: `"9 P.3d 655"` incorrectly receives canonical data from `"59 P.3d 655"`! ‚ùå

### **Why This Happened**

Fix #8 was designed to prevent canonical data contamination across different citations in the same cluster, but it didn't account for **citations that returned errors (404s)**. It only checked `verified=True`, not whether the citation had an `error` field.

## üîß **The Fix**

### **File Modified**: `src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py`

**Lines 3720-3751** (First Citation):
```python
# Get data from first citation
if cluster.get('citations'):
    first_citation = cluster['citations'][0]
    if isinstance(first_citation, dict):
        # CRITICAL FIX #10: Check if first citation has error before using its canonical data
        citation_has_error = first_citation.get('error') is not None and first_citation.get('error') != ''
        citation_is_verified = first_citation.get('verified', False) and not citation_has_error
        
        # Always get extracted data
        extracted_name = first_citation.get('extracted_case_name')
        extracted_date = first_citation.get('extracted_date')
        
        # ONLY get canonical data if verified and no error
        if citation_is_verified:
            canonical_name = first_citation.get('canonical_name')
            canonical_date = first_citation.get('canonical_date')
            canonical_url = first_citation.get('canonical_url') or first_citation.get('url')
```

**Lines 3753-3787** (All Citations Fallback):
```python
# Fallback: If we still don't have data, check all citations (maintain data separation!)
if cluster.get('citations'):
    for cit in cluster['citations']:
        if isinstance(cit, dict):
            # CRITICAL FIX #10: Only use canonical data if the citation was ACTUALLY verified
            # and did NOT return an error (e.g., 404). Citations with errors should have
            # NO canonical data, even if they're clustered with verified citations.
            citation_has_error = cit.get('error') is not None and cit.get('error') != ''
            citation_is_verified = cit.get('verified', False) and not citation_has_error
            
            # Always try to get extracted data from any citation
            if not extracted_name:
                extracted_name = cit.get('extracted_case_name')
            if not extracted_date:
                extracted_date = cit.get('extracted_date')
            
            # ONLY get canonical data from citations that were successfully verified (no errors)
            if citation_is_verified:
                if not canonical_name:
                    canonical_name = cit.get('canonical_name')
                if not canonical_date:
                    canonical_date = cit.get('canonical_date')
                if not canonical_url:
                    canonical_url = cit.get('canonical_url') or cit.get('url')
```

## ‚úÖ **What This Fix Does**

1. **Checks for errors**: Before using canonical data, checks if `error` field exists and is non-empty
2. **Proper verification status**: A citation is only considered "verified" if:
   - `verified=True` **AND**
   - `error` is `None` or empty string
3. **Data separation**: Extracted data (from document) is always collected, but canonical data (from API) is **only** collected from successfully verified citations
4. **Prevents contamination**: Citations with 404 errors will **never** receive canonical data, even if clustered with verified citations

---

## üìä **Expected Results**

After this fix:
- ‚úÖ **"9 P.3d 655"**: Shows extracted data only, **NO canonical data** (404)
- ‚úÖ **"192 Wn.2d 453"**: Shows extracted data only, **NO canonical data** (404)
- ‚úÖ **"183 Wn.2d 649"**: Shows correct canonical data ("Lopez Demetrio")
- ‚úÖ **"430 P.3d 655"**: Shows correct canonical data ("Spokane Cnty.")

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining Issues**

This fix addresses the **canonical data contamination for 404 citations**, but there are still **extraction issues**:

1. **"183 Wn.2d 649"**: Extracted as "Spokane County" (should be "State v. M.Y.G." or similar)
2. **"182 Wn.2d 342"**: Extracted as "State v. Velasquez" (wrong case)
3. **"430 P.3d 655"**: Extracted as "Lopez Demetrio" (should be "Archdiocese" or similar)

These are **extraction contamination issues** (picking up wrong case names from document), not verification issues. They will need to be addressed separately.

- **Fix #8**: Cluster Canonical Data Contamination (first attempt)
- **Fix #9**: API Response Structure Parsing

## üìù **Testing Checklist**

After deploying this fix, verify:
- [ ] 404 citations show NO canonical data
- [ ] Verified citations show correct canonical data
- [ ] Clustered citations don't share canonical data unless individually verified
- [ ] Error messages are preserved for failed verifications
- [ ] Frontend displays "Citation not found" or similar for 404s

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. Test the fix in production with `1033940.pdf`
2. Verify that 404 citations no longer show canonical data
3. Address the remaining extraction contamination issues separately
