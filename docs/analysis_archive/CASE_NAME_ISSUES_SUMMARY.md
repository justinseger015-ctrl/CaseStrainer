# Case Name Extraction Issues - Comprehensive Analysis

## Issues Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Canonical Contamination
**Problem:** Canonical data from APIs contaminating `extracted_case_name` field  
**Status:** FIXED in previous session  
**Files:** `src/unified_citation_clustering.py`, `src/unified_case_extraction_master.py`

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Sentence Fragment Contamination in Master Extractor
**Problem:** "scheme as a whole. Ass'n of..." → extracted as "scheme as a whole. Ass'n..."  
**Status:** FIXED with cleaning logic in `_clean_case_name()`  
**File:** `src/unified_case_extraction_master.py` lines 420-431

### 3. ✅ FIXED: Pattern IGNORECASE Bug
**Problem:** Pattern with `re.IGNORECASE` + `[A-Z]` matched lowercase 'n' in "Ass'n"  
**Result:** Started extracting from 'n' instead of 'A'  
**Status:** FIXED - removed IGNORECASE flag  
**File:** `src/unified_case_extraction_master.py` line 153

### 4. ⚠️ NEW ISSUE: Citation Extractor Pattern Bug
**Problem:** Same IGNORECASE bug in `citation_extractor.py`  
**Status:** FIXED but not taking effect  
**File:** `src/services/citation_extractor.py` line 287

### 5. ⚠️ NEW ISSUE: Clustering Uses Pre-Extracted Names
**Problem:** Clustering gets truncated names from citations that were extracted with old buggy patterns  
**Status:** PARTIAL FIX - added cleaning in `_select_best_case_name()` but still seeing truncated names  
**File:** `src/unified_clustering_master.py` line 134-149

### 6. ❌ CRITICAL: Extract Metadata Not Being Called
**Problem:** `extract_metadata()` function with our fixes is not being executed  
**Evidence:** No debug logs appear when citations are processed  
**Possible Causes:**
- Adaptive learning might be replacing citations
- Citations might already have `extracted_case_name` set before `extract_metadata()`
- Some caching or other code path

## Current State

**Test Results (1033940.pdf):**
- Expected: "Ass'n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd."
- Actual: "Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd." (missing "Ass'n of Wash.")

## Root Cause Analysis

The truncation happens because:
1. Old pattern with `re.IGNORECASE` + `\b[A-Z]` matched at 'n' in "Ass'n"
2. This pattern was in `citation_extractor.py` and citations got extracted with truncated names
3. These truncated names are stored in CitationResult objects
4. Even though we fixed the patterns, the function that uses them isn't running
5. Clustering uses the pre-extracted truncated names

## Fixes Applied

### In unified_case_extraction_master.py
1. Added sentence fragment cleaning (lines 420-431)
2. Fixed PRIORITY 1 pattern to not use IGNORECASE
3. Added PRIORITY 0 pattern for better parallel citation handling

### In unified_clustering_master.py
1. Added `_clean_case_name_from_extraction()` method (lines 134-149)
2. This cleans names when selecting best case name from group

### In services/citation_extractor.py
1. Changed patterns to not use IGNORECASE with [A-Z] (line 287)
2. Increased search window from 50 to 200 chars (line 504)
3. Added inline cleaning (lines 520-529)

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Find why `extract_metadata()` isn't being called**
   - Check if adaptive learning is bypassing it
   - Check if citations already have names before this function
   - Add logging to understand the flow

2. **Ensure cleaning happens at citation extraction time**
   - Not just during clustering
   - Names should be clean when CitationResult objects are created

3. **Test with fresh extraction**
   - Clear any cached data
   - Ensure new patterns are being used

## Testing

Run these tests to verify:
```bash
python test_fresh_extraction.py
python test_cluster_structure.py
python test_comprehensive_verification.py
```
