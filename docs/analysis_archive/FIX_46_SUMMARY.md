# Fix #46: Stop Backward Search at Previous Citation

## Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED & ACTIVE

### What Was Fixed

Added logic to `_extract_case_name_from_context()` in `unified_citation_processor_v2.py` to stop backward searches at the previous citation boundary when extracting case names.

### The Problem

When citations are close together (e.g., parallel citations or citations in close proximity), the backward search (300 chars) was capturing case names from PREVIOUS citations instead of the current citation.

**Example:**
```
"Tingey v. Haisch, 159 Wn.2d 652 ... FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES, 148 Wn.2d 224, 59 P.3d 655"
                    ^previous citation         ^current citations
```

The backward search from "148 Wn.2d 224" would capture "Tingey v. Haisch" instead of "FRATERNAL ORDER".

### The Solution

```python
# FIX #46: Find previous citation and stop there
if all_citations:
    # Find all citations that end before current citation starts
    previous_citations = [c for c in all_citations 
                         if c.end_index and c.end_index < start 
                         and c.citation != citation.citation]
    
    if previous_citations:
        # Find the closest previous citation
        closest_previous = max(previous_citations, key=lambda c: c.end_index)
        # Stop context at the previous citation's end (plus small buffer for punctuation)
        context_start = max(context_start, closest_previous.end_index + 1)
        logger.debug(f"[FIX #46] Stopping backward search at previous citation '{closest_previous.citation}' (end={closest_previous.end_index})")
```

### Verification

From logs after deployment:
```
2025-10-10 00:44:04 - [FIX #46] Stopping backward search at previous citation '171 Wn.2d 486' (end=26986)
2025-10-10 00:44:04 - [FIX #46] Stopping backward search at previous citation '821 P.2d 18' (end=51316)
2025-10-10 00:44:04 - [FIX #46] Stopping backward search at previous citation '198 Wn.2d 418' (end=51613)
...
```

**Fix #46 is actively working** - it's stopping backward searches at previous citations.

### Test Results

- **Total citations:** 88 (unchanged from Fix #45)
- **Total clusters:** 57 (unchanged from Fix #45)
- **Status:** 200 OK
- **Extraction:** "183 Wn.2d 649" correctly extracts "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms" ✅

### Expected Impact

1. **Improved extraction accuracy:** Case names should now be extracted from the correct context window
2. **Reduced contamination:** Previous citations won't contaminate current citation extraction
3. **Better clustering:** Correct case names will improve clustering decisions

### Known Limitations

1. **Still relies on pattern matching:** The fix improves the context, but extraction still depends on regex patterns finding "X v. Y" structures
2. **Doesn't fix all issues:** Some citations may still extract wrong names if:
   - The actual case name is not in "X v. Y" format
   - The case name is abbreviated or truncated
   - Multiple case names appear between citations

3. **API verification issues remain:** Even with correct extraction, API verification may still return wrong cases (Priority #3)

### Remaining Issues

Even with Fix #46, we still need to address:

1. **Parallel citation splitting (Priority #2):** Many parallel pairs are split into separate clusters with `_split_` suffix
2. **API verification failures (Priority #3):** Some citations verify to completely wrong cases
3. **Year mismatches:** Extracted dates sometimes don't match canonical dates

### Next Steps

1. **Analyze Fix #46 impact:** Compare test_fix45.json vs test_fix46.json to measure improvement in extracted case names
2. **Address Priority #2:** Fix cluster splitting logic  to be less aggressive
3. **Address Priority #3:** Add jurisdiction/year filtering to API verification

## Integration

- **File Modified:** `src/unified_citation_processor_v2.py` (lines 1663-1688)
- **Function:** `_extract_case_name_from_context()`
- **Dependencies:** Requires `all_citations` parameter to be passed
- **Backward Compatible:** Yes - gracefully handles cases where `all_citations` is None

## Testing

- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ Verified logging is active
- ✅ Quick test shows 88 citations, 57 clusters (system stable)
- ⏳ Detailed comparison of before/after extraction quality pending
