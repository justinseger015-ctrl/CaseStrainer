# Async Task Processing Fix - CaseStrainer

## Problem Description

The async task processing system was failing with the following symptoms:
- Tasks were being queued and processed by the RQ worker
- Worker logs showed "Task completed, result written to Redis"
- However, `/task_status` endpoint always returned "processing" status
- Task results were not being stored in Redis properly

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Docker Volume Mounts Missing
- The Docker containers (`backend` and `rqworker`) were using built-in code from the Docker image
- Live code changes from the host filesystem were not being reflected in the containers
- This prevented debugging and code updates from taking effect

### Issue 2: Redis Configuration Timing
- `REDIS_TASK_TRACKING` was being set before `REDIS_AVAILABLE` was defined
- This caused `REDIS_TASK_TRACKING` to default to `False`
- As a result, task results were stored in-memory instead of Redis
- The `/task_status` endpoint couldn't find results because they weren't in Redis

## Solution

### Fix 1: Add Source Code Volume Mounts
Updated `docker-compose.dev.yml` to mount the source code directory:

```yaml
# For both backend and rqworker services
volumes:
  - ./src:/app/src  # Add this line
  - ./uploads:/app/uploads
  - ./data:/app/data
  - ./logs:/app/logs
```

### Fix 2: Fix Redis Configuration Order
Moved the `REDIS_TASK_TRACKING` assignment to after the Redis configuration:

```python
# In src/vue_api_endpoints.py, around line 200
# After Redis connection setup:
redis_conn = Redis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, db=redis_db)
redis_conn.ping()  # Test connection
REDIS_AVAILABLE = True

# Add this line after Redis configuration:
REDIS_TASK_TRACKING = REDIS_AVAILABLE
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Volume Mounts**: Verify containers have access to live code
   ```bash
   docker exec casestrainer-rqworker cat /app/src/vue_api_endpoints.py | grep "CRITICAL DEBUG"
   ```

2. **Test Redis Connection**: Ensure Redis is accessible from worker
   ```bash
   docker exec casestrainer-rqworker python -c "import redis; r = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379, db=0); print(r.ping())"
   ```

3. **Submit Test Task**: Use the test script to verify end-to-end functionality
   ```bash
   python test_task.py
   ```

4. **Check Redis Keys**: Verify all expected keys are created
   ```bash
   docker exec casestrainer-redis-prod redis-cli KEYS "*<task_id>*"
   # Should show: task_to_job, task_status, task_result
   ```

5. **Check Worker Logs**: Verify Redis storage is being used
   ```bash
   docker logs casestrainer-rqworker --tail 20
   # Should show: "Verified result stored in Redis"
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Tasks are queued and processed by RQ worker
- ✅ Task results are stored in Redis with proper JSON serialization
- ✅ `/task_status` endpoint returns completed results
- ✅ Frontend receives expected response format
- ✅ All three Redis keys are created: `task_to_job`, `task_status`, `task_result`

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always ensure Docker volume mounts include source code directories for development
2. Verify Redis configuration variables are set in the correct order
3. Test async processing after any changes to the task processing system
4. Monitor worker logs for "Using in-memory storage" vs "Verified result stored in Redis"
