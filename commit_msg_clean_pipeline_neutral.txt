ACTUAL FIX: Add neutral citations to clean_extraction_pipeline

ROOT CAUSE (FINALLY IDENTIFIED!):
The system uses clean_extraction_pipeline.py (method: "clean_pipeline_v1") 
for production extraction, NOT unified_citation_processor_v2.py!

All my previous fixes were to the wrong file. The neutral citation patterns
needed to be added to clean_extraction_pipeline.py's pattern dictionary.

Previous (Wrong) Fixes:
1. ✅ Added patterns to unified_citation_processor_v2.py - WRONG FILE
2. ✅ Added to priority_patterns list - WRONG FILE  
3. ✅ Added to strict_context_isolator.py - CORRECT but not enough

Actual Fix (THIS COMMIT):
Added neutral citation patterns to clean_extraction_pipeline.py:
- neutral_nm: 2017-NM-007 (New Mexico)
- neutral_nd: 2017 ND 123 (North Dakota)
- neutral_ok, neutral_sd, neutral_ut, neutral_wi, neutral_wy, neutral_mt

This is the pipeline that actually runs in production based on the 
"method": "clean_pipeline_v1" field in the API responses.

Expected Result:
Text: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe, 2017-NM-007, 388 P.3d 977"

Extraction:
1. Citation: 2017-NM-007 (extracted by neutral_nm pattern) ✅
2. Citation: 388 P.3d 977 (extracted by p_3d pattern) ✅

Case Name Extraction:
1. For 2017-NM-007: "Hamaatsa, Inc. v. Pueblo of San Felipe" ✅
2. For 388 P.3d 977: Gets from clustering (stops at 2017-NM-007 boundary) ✅

Clustering:
- Both citations clustered as parallels (same case name) ✅

This should FINALLY fix the issue after 4 attempts.
