Fix critical async processing and deployment issues

CRITICAL FIXES:

1. Rate Limit Infinite Loop (unified_verification_master.py)
   - Added detection for CourtListener rate limit errors (429)
   - Prevent fallback verification when rate limited
   - Stop infinite retry loops that hung the system
   - Result: Sync processing now completes in 2-3s (was timing out)

2. Redis Connection (.env)
   - Fixed Redis port: 6380 -> 6379
   - Backend can now properly connect to Redis
   - Async jobs can be enqueued correctly

3. Python Bytecode Cache (cslaunch.ps1)
   - Clear cache on HOST filesystem
   - Clear cache INSIDE Docker containers
   - REBUILD backend instead of just restarting
   - Guarantees code changes are deployed
   - Result: ./cslaunch now properly deploys code

4. Enhanced Logging (unified_input_processor.py)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Helps trace async job execution

TESTING:
- All 3 upload methods working (text, file, URL)
- Sync processing: 2-3s for small documents
- Async processing: 6-8s for large documents  
- URL/PDF processing: 52 citations found in test
- Rate limits: Handled gracefully, no hangs

TEST SCRIPTS:
- test_api_direct.py - Sync processing validation
- test_async_final.py - Async processing validation
- test_user_url.py - URL/PDF processing test
- test_rate_limit.py - Rate limit stress test
- test_wolf_production.py - Production server test
- check_prod_task.ps1 - Task status checker

IMPACT:
- System fully functional after 3 hours debugging
- All upload methods working for sync and async
- Production deployments now reliable with ./cslaunch
- Rate limits handled gracefully without system hangs
