2 49.58.110(4).1  This case  concerns the interpretation of the key term “job applicant” in 
RCW 49.58.110(4).  The federal district court has asked this court to determine what a 
plaintiff must prove to be deemed a “job applicant.”  We  hold that a plaintiff must apply 
to a specific job posting but is not required to prove they are a “bona fide” or “good faith” 
applicant to obtain remedies  under the statute. 
BACKGROUND  
The defendant, Washington Fine Wine and  Spirits LLC, which does business as  
Total Wine and More (Total Wine), is a Washington limited liability company that owns 
and operates 13 retail liquor stores throughout Washington.  All job openings at  Total 
Wine are posted on their official website, and some of their retail stores also use third-
party sites such as  Indeed.com.2   
After the effective date in RCW 49.58.110, plaintiffs Lisa Branson and Cherie 
Burke submitted applications for job openings at the defendant’s retail stores.  Branson 
submitted an application through Indeed.com for a retail sales  associate position at  Total 
Wine’s Tukwila store; however, the job posting for that position did not include the 
salary or wage range a s required by the EPOA.  Similarly, Burke applied for a 
cashier/customer service position at  Total Wine’s Tukwila store through Indeed.com and 
through Total Wine’s official website; however, the job posting on Indeed.com did not include the required pay range information.  Unlike Branson, Burke had  an in-person 
1 Effective  July 27, 2025, RCW  49.58.110(4) and  (5) provide  the exclusive  remedies available for  
violations of the statute.   See LAWS  OF 2025, ch.  383, §§ 4-6.  The  amendments  do not impact our 
analysis of a “job  applicant” who  is eligible  for these  remedies.  
2 All job postings on Total  Wine’s  official  website,  under the “Career  Search ” button include salary  and 
wage  ranges.

3 interview for the position and discussed pay  with the Tukwila store manager.  Burke did 
not accept  the offer made to her by  Total Wine for the position.  
Subsequently, Branson  and Burke filed an amended  class action complaint against 
Total Wine in King  County, invoking their right to statutory damages  under RCW 
49.58.070 and RCW 49.58.110 for Total Wine’s failure to  post the required wage scale or  
salary range in its job postings on  Indeed.com.   Total Wine filed a motion to bifurcate 
discovery, arguing that the plaintiffs are not  the type of “job applicants” the EPOA  
intended to  protect since the statute  is meant  to protect “bona fide” applicants.  The 
plaintiffs opposed the motion, and  the parties disputed the meaning of  “job applicant” in 
the EPOA.    
The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington then 
certified the following question:  “ What  must a Plaintiff prove to be deemed  a ‘job 
applicant’ within the meaning of RCW 49.58.110(4)?  For example, must they prove that 
they are a ‘bona fide’ applicant”?  Ord. Certifying Question to Wash.  State Sup.  Ct. at  2 
(W.D. Wash.  Aug. 20, 2024).  We  accepted  certification.  
ANALYSIS  
Certified questions  are questions of law that this court reviews de novo and in light 
of the record  certified  by the federal court.  Lopez  Demetrio v.  Sakuma Bros. Farms, 183 
Wn.2d 649, 655, 355 P.3d 258 (2015).  Statutory interpretation is  also an  issue of law we  
review de novo.  Spokane County v.  Dep’t of Fish & Wildlife, 192 Wn.2d 453, 457, 430 
P.3d 655 (2018).

4 We are asked  to interpret the statutory term  “job applicant” within RCW 
49.58.110(4).  Our  “fundamental objective is to ascertain and carry  out the Legislature’s 
intent, and if the statute’s meaning is plain  on its face,  then the court must give effect to 
that plain meaning as  an expression of legislative intent.”  Dep’t of  Ecology v.  Campbell  
& Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9-10 , 43 P.3d 4 (2002).  In addition to looking at  the plain 
language to determine legislative intent, we  consider “the text of the provision in  
question, the context of  the statute in which the provision  is found, related provisions, 
amendments to the provision, and  the statutory  scheme as  a whole.”  Ass’n of Wash. 
Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd., 182 Wn.2d 342, 350, 340 
P.3d 849 (2015) (citing  Campbell & Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at  9-10).  If the plain language of  
the statute is  clear  and subject to only one  reasonable interpretation, then we look no 
further.  State v.  Velasquez, 176 Wn.2d 333, 336, 292 P.3d  92 (2013) .  A term does not 
become ambiguous  “merely  because  multiple interpretations are conceivable” but  rather 
when it is subject to  more than one  reasonable interpretation.  Id.   
The Plain Language  of “Job Applicant” in RCW 49.58.110(4)  
The EPOA, formerly known as  the Equal Pay Act, was enacted  in Washington in  
1943 to prohibit gender -based pay discrimination.  See L AWS  OF 1943, ch. 254, §  1.  In 
2018, the EPOA  was expanded to enhance enforcement by  allowing the Department of 
Labor and Industries (L&I) to investigate complaints made by employees for violations 
of the act .  See  RCW 49.58.060.  In 2019, the EPOA was  further expanded to require that  
employers provide the wage or salary range or minimum  wage to  a job applicant upon

5 their request after an initial job offer had been made by the employer.  Former RCW 
49.58.110(1) (2019).   
In 2022, the legislature amended RCW 49.58.110(1) to require employers to 
disclose salary, wage,  and benefits information in all job postings.  Now, wage or salary 
ranges must be provided in all job postings regardless of whether an  applicant requests 
the information or whether they receive a job offer.  As it currently stands, RCW 
49.58.110 states in  relevant part: 
(1) The emp loyer must disclose in e ach posting for each  job opening the
wage scale or  salary range, and a general  description of all of the ben efits
and other compensation to be offered to the hired applicant. For  the
purposes of  this section, “posting” means any solicitation intende d to
recruit job applicants for a specific available position, including recr uitment
done directly by an employer or indirectly through a third party, and
includes any  postings done electronically, or with a printed hard copy,  that
includes qualifications for desired applicants.
. . . . 
(4) A job applicant or a n employee is entitled to the reme dies in
RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070 for violations of this section. 
(Emphasis added.)  
RCW 49.58.110(4) provides two potential remedies for job applicants and 
employees.  First, they may either submit a complaint to L&I, who may  then initiate an 
investigation for EPOA  violations.  See RCW 49.58.060.  Second, they may bring a civil 
action against an  employer for actual  damages or “statutory damages  equal to the actual 
damages or five thousand dollars, whichever is  greater,” among other relief.  RCW 
49.58.070(1).3 
3 Aaron’s LLC  amicus  brief  argues that  although job  applicants are  entitled  to the remedies prescribed  in 
RCW  49.58.070, the  statute creates  a private  right  of action  only for  employees.  Included in  its argument

6 The legislature did not provide a definition  for the term “job applicant” in chapter 
49.58 RCW.  Both parties agree that  the plain language of the term  resolves the question 
before us; however, they disagree on  the correct definition of the term .  The defendant 
argues that the term in the context of the EPOA  has a readily ascertainable meaning, 
which is “a  person who formally notifies an  employer of the person’s genuine interest in  
filling a specific posted  job.”  Answering Br. of  Resp’t-Def. Wash . Fine  Wine & Spirits 
LLC (Br. of  Resp’t) at  26.  Total Wine concludes that a “job applicant” “must be a person 
who actually applied for the job with a good faith or bona fide interest  in obtaining the 
posted job.”  Id. at  62.  The plaintiffs argue that the legislature intended the term to  
conform to its universally accepted  definition and ask us to hold that the term 
unambiguously means  “any  person  who applies to a job posting.”  Opening Br. of 
Pls./Appellants at  24.  We agree with the plaintiffs.  
Since the statute does not provide a  definition of the term, we look to dictionary 
definitions  “ʻto determine a word’s  plain and  ordinary meaning.ʼ”  State v.  M.Y.G., 199 
Wn.2d 528, 532, 509 P.3d 818 (2022) (plurality opinion) (quoting Am. Legion Post No.  
32 v.  City of  Walla  Walla, 116 Wn.2d 1, 8,  802 P.2d 784 (1991)).  The term “applicant” 
is defined as  “one who applies for something :  one who makes a usu[ally] formal request 
esp[ecially] for something of benefit to himself.”  W EBSTER ’S THIRD  NEW 
INTERNATIONAL  DICTIONARY  105 (2002).  Another dictionary defines it similarly as  
“[o]ne who applies or makes request”  O XFORD ENGLISH  DICTIONARY  405-06 (1993).  
 
is that the  rule of lenity  supports  a finding that job applicants do  not have  a private  right  of action  under  
the EPOA.   However,  this court  need  not consider  issues raised  solely  by amici.   Coburn v.  Seda, 101 
Wn.2d 270, 279, 677 P.2d  173 (1984)  

=== PAGE 7 ===

7 The related term “apply” means “to  make an  appeal  or a request esp[ecially] formally and  
often in writing and  usu[ally] for something of  benefit to oneself.”   WEBSTER ’S, supra, at  
105.  These  definitions do not rely on the subjective intent of an  individual to determine 
whether a person is an applicant.  They simply  require that an individual submits a formal 
application or request for a job.   
Total Wine argues that a “job applicant” must possess an  intent or  genuine interest 
in obtaining a job.  The plaintiffs contend that subjective intent is irrelevant because  the 
legislature could have included qualifying language to the  statute,  such as  “bona fide” job 
applicant, if  it intended  to limit the type of  job applicant who is entitled to remedies.  
Total Wine counters  that if the legislature added qualifying language it would be  “mere 
surplusage when the meaning of the term is  clear  without [it].”  Br. of  Resp’t at  25.  It 
contends that bots or deceased  relatives could  recover under the statute since the 
legislature did not write “‘ human job applicant.’”  Id. at  26.  It further  argues that the 
plaintiffs’ interpretation would mean  that the legislature intended to  protect individuals 
who submit applications in bad faith.  Total Wine’s argument overlooks the language in 
the definition of “applicant,” which  refers to  a person or “one who applies” for 
something,  which indicates a living human.  Thus, we need not be  concerned  that bots, 
pets, or deceased  individuals will pursue claims as  “job applicants.”  
The plain language of the term “job  applicant”  means a person who applies to a 
job posting, regardless of their subjective intent in doing  so.  W e must give effect  to that

(2012).   
The statutory scheme supports the  plaintiffs’ interpretat ion.  In the  “Findings—
Intent” section of the EPOA, the l egislature found that “there continues to be a gap in 
wages and advancement  opportunities among workers in Washington, especially 
women,” which has  led to “higher rates  of poverty among women  and children.”  RCW 
49.58.005(1).  The legislature intended  to “address income disparities, employer  
discrimination, and  retaliation practices, and  to reflect the equal status of all workers in 
Washington state.”  RCW 49.58.005(2).   
Over time, the legislature has expanded  the protections afforded to  employees and 
applicants, demonstrating the legislature’s concern  with ending income disparities and 
gender inequality.  For example, it amended  former RCW 49.58.110(1) to require  that 
employers include wage scale or salary range  information in each  job posting made by 
the employer or indirectly through  a third party rather than  waiting until after an  applicant  
is offered a position.   
Other sections of the EPOA  also support  our interpretation of the term.  “[W]here  
the legislature includes  particular language in  one section of a statute but omits it in 
another, the exclusion is  presumed  intentional. ˮ  Perez-Crisantos  v. State Farm Fire & 
Cas. Co., 187 Wn.2d 669, 680, 389 P.3d  476 (2017).  Here,  the legislature has included 
 
4 If the legislature  intend s to limit  the statute  to bona  fide job seekers, it  can amend  the statute  as was 
recently  attempted,  by defin ing the term “job applicant ” in RCW  49.58.110 as “a  person  who  has made  
and submitted  a bona  fide application for employment.”   H.B.  2349, at  2, 68th Leg. , Reg.  Sess.  (Wash.  
2024);  S.B.  6241, at  2, 68th Leg. , Reg.  Sess.  (Wash.  2024) ; see also LAWS  OF 2025, ch. 383  (not defining  
or adding qualifying  language  to the term “job  applicant”).

9 qualifying language  in other parts of the EPOA,  which indicates that it purposely omitted 
qualifying language  in RCW 49.58.110(4).  For example, in RCW 49.58.110(1) the 
legislature used the term “desired applicants” in its definition of “posting.”  The 
legislature also included the term “bona fide” in other sections of  the EPOA.  See RCW 
49.58.020- .030 (referring to good  faith, bona fide job-related  factors that justify a 
differential in  compensation).  The legislature could have included  the same qualifying 
language here but chose  not to.  “‘ [A] court  must not add  words where the legislature has 
chosen not to include them.’”  Lucid Grp.  USA, Inc. v.  Dep’t of Licensing, 33 Wn. App. 
2d 75, 81, 559 P.3d  545 (2024) (quoting Rest.  Dev., Inc. v.  Cananwill, Inc., 150 Wn.2d 
674, 682, 80 P.3d  598 (2003)), review  denied, 4 Wn.3d 1021 (2025).  
Additionally, RCW 49.44.200(1) prohibits employers from requesting or requiring 
“an employee or applicant” to disclose log in information for their  personal social 
networking  accounts.  The statute states that “ applicant” “means an  applicant for 
employment.”  RCW 49.44.200(5)(b).  The definition of “applicant” is  broadly defined 
and does no t mention the subjective intent of the applicant.  An employee or applicant is 
provided a private right  of action for violations  under RCW 49.44.205.  If the legislature 
intended to  add a qualifier to the term “job applicant,” it could have  done so as  it did in 
RCW 49.94.010(1), which restricts employers from requesting information about  an 
applicant’s criminal record until the employer has initially determined  that the applicant 
is “otherwise qualified.”  “‘ Otherwise qualified’ means that the applicant meets the basic 
criteria for the position as set out in  the advertisement or job description without  
consideration of a criminal record.”  RCW 49.94.005.  Total Wine contends that 

=== PAGE 10 ===

10 individuals may apply for positions they are clearly  unqualified for  and then bring suit.  
However, if  the legislature intended  only “ qualified job applicants”  to be entitled to  
remedies, it  could have  included similar limiting language  in RCW 49.58.110(4).  
Even if the term “job applicant” is  ambiguous, the legislative history of RCW 
49.58.110(4) supports defining the  term more broadly.  See Perez- Crisantos, 187 Wn.2d 
at 680 (when there is  ambiguity in  a statute, courts have turned to  extrinsic evidence of 
legislative intent).  In 2022, the leg islature recognized the importance  of individuals 
being provided with pay-related information “ before they apply for a job” in order to 
combat pay inequity, avoid wasted time, and “make our market more competitive.”5  
Engrossed Substitute S enate Bill 5761 now requires employers to  disclose hourly or 
salary compensation and  a general description of all benefits in each  posting for each  job 
opening.  See  ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE  S.B. 5761, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2022).   
The initial version of Senate Bill 5761 (S.B. 5761) stated that “[a] n individual is  
entitled to the remedies  in RCW 49.58.060 and  49.58.070 for violations of this  section.”  
Id. (emphasis added).  At the public hearing in  the Senate  Committee on Labor, 
Commerce & Tribal  Affairs, L&I raised concerns about the cost of the bill, including for  
investigating complaints, and noted that anyone may file a complaint, not just applicants 
or employees.  The agency suggested changing the term “individual”  to “job applicant or  
an employee.”  S.B.  REP. ON S.B. 5761, at  2-3, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2022).

11 The committee revised the bill to make that change.   This means that the 
legislature specifically considered who could obtain remedies under the statute and  
limited protection to  those individuals who actually applied for the  job.  Significantly, the 
legislature did not include any further limitation.  
L&I’s Internal Policies   
 
Under RCW 49.58.090, L&I is authorized to adopt rules to  implement RCW 
49.58.005 and 49.58.020-.060.  Total Wine  states that although RCW 49.58.110 does not 
fall under the listed provisions subject to L&I’s rule making, L&I’s rule making  extends  
to RCW 49.58.005, which announces the legislative intent  for the EPOA.  This includes  
the legislature’s intent “to require an  employer to provide  wage and  salary information to  
applicants and employees.”  RCW 49.58.005(4).  Total Wine argues that since L&I has 
the authority to administer the EPOA within the full scope of the legislature’s intent and 
also has the  requisite expertise to carry out  that authority, we should give the agency’s 
interpretation of an  ambiguous statute great weight in determining legislative intent.  
“‘[A]gency interpretations of statutes are accorded  deference only if  “(1) the 
particular agency is charged with the administration and enforcement  of the statute, (2) 
the statute is  ambiguous, and (3) the statute falls within the agency’s special  expertise.”’”  
Lucid Grp. USA, Inc., 33 Wn. App. 2d at  80 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Fode v.  Dep’t 
of Ecology, 22 Wn.  App. 2d 22, 33, 509 P.3d 325 (2022)  (quoting Bostain v.  Food 
Express, Inc., 159 Wn.2d 700, 716, 153 P.3d 846 (2007) )).  However, courts are not 
bound by agency interpretation as  courts have the “‘“ultimate authority to interpret a

12 (2021) (quoting Bostain, 159 Wn.2d at 716)).  Under RCW 49.58.060(1), L&I is  tasked 
with investigating complaints made by job applicants and employees to determine if there 
has been  a violation of the EPOA.  If a violation has occurred, L&I may, among other 
things, “order the employer to pay to the complainant actual  damages; statutory damages 
equal to the actual  damages or five thousand dollars, whichever is greater.”  RCW 
49.58.060(2)(a). 
In administering and  enforcing RCW 49.58.060, L&I issued F700 -200-000, which 
is a complaint form that also addresses who can file a complaint.  It  states that “L&I will 
investigate complaints filed by applicants who have applied to a job in  good faith with 
the intent of  gaining employment.  L&I generally only assesses damages  when an  
applicant can establish they have suffered a financial loss as  a result of  a violation of the 
law.”  W ASH. STATE  DEP’T OF LAB. & INDUS ., EQUAL  PAY & OPPORTUNITIES  ACT 
COMPLAINT  FORM  at 1 (July 2025), https://lni.wa.gov/forms-publications/F700-200-
000.pdf [https://perma.cc/FH2P-2CWL].
Total Wine points  to this form to support its interpretation that “job applicants” 
must be people who apply for jobs in good faith or have a bona fide intention of gaining employment.  However, L&I does not have rule making authority over the meaning of 
the term “job applicant,” and the meaning of  “job applicant” is not ambiguous.  
Moreover, L&I does not define the term “job applicant” but instead defines the complaints it will investigate.  Considering the concern raised by L&I regarding cost to 
the agency, it  is likely its limitation is due to its limited resources.  As noted, the agency 
already expressed concerns regarding the costs  of investigating complaints, which is why

13 it urged the legislature to amend S .B. 5761 to limit the remedies afforded to job 
applicants and employees instead of  any individual.  See S.B.  REP. ON S.B. 5761,  at 3. 
Significantly, in 2024, L&I published its preliminary draft  rule language for the 
EPOA, which included  a definition of the term  “applicant.”  It defined the term as  “an 
individual,  including existing employees,  who submits in good faith  an application for a 
job posting with the intent of gaining employment.”  Pls ./Appellants ’ Statement  of 
Additional  Auths. , Attach. A at  1.  In response, seven members of the Washington State 
House of Representatives signed and submitted a public comment  letter.  The letter 
stated:  
We are concerned  the current draft undermines  the Legislature’s intent.  
Specifically, the definition of “applicant” in  the preliminary draft (and the 
specification that job applicants or  employees  must demonstrate lost 
compensation to recover damages each  undermine key components of the 
EPOA).  
. . . .  
We have historically  declined to qualify or  narrow the definition of 
“applicant” because we intend for this unambiguous term  to be understood 
by its plain and ordinary meaning.  For the EPOA’s salary  disclosure 
requirement to work as  intended, anyone who applied to the job must have 
access  to the  remedies we set out in  RCW 49.58.060 and  .070.  Requiring a 
job applicant to prove subjective “intent” adds a new element to the  cause 
of action in order to  access  remedies [and] would frustrate  a key purpose of 
the statute[.]   This is  the opposite of our intent. 
 
Id., Attach. B at 1.  To avoid contradicting the legislature’s intent,  included in the letter 
was a request that L&I remove the definition of  “applicant”  and remove the requirement 
that a job applicant or employee demonstrate actual damages.  It reasoned that statutory 
damages were provided under both RCW 49.58.060 and  .070 because most violations of 
.110 do not result in provable monetary loss, and the legislature wants  “to ensure  

=== PAGE 14 ===
No. 103394- 0 
 
 
14 compliance with the  statute by allowing job applicants and  employees to recover 
reasonable statutory  damages for violations.”  Id. at  2. 
 Subsequently, L&I published an  updated version of its draft rule language, 
removing the definition  of applicant, and removing the requirement that job applicants 
and employees demonstrate actual  damages.  See id., Attach. C at  1, 6.  Total Wine’s 
reliance on L&I’s definition of “job applicantˮ  is misplaced.  
The Plain Meaning  of “Job Applicant” Does Not Produce Absurd  Results  
Lastly, Total Wine argues that construing  “job applicant”  to mean  anyone who  
applies to a job opening regardless  of their subjective intent yields unlikely, absurd, and  
strained consequences.   
“Where  the legislature provides no  statutory definition and  a court  gives a term its 
plain and ordinary meaning by reference to a  dictionary, the court  ‘will avoid literal 
reading of a statute which would result in unlikely, absurd, or strained consequences.’”  
Tingey v.  Haisch, 159 Wn.2d 652, 663-64, 152 P.3d 1020 (2007) (quoting Fraternal Ord. 
of Eagles, Tenino Aerie  No. 564 v.  Grand  Aerie of Fraternal Ord . of Eagles, 148 Wn.2d  
224, 239, 59 P.3d  655 (2002)).  “[I] t will not be  presumed that the legislature intended 
absurd results.”  State v.  Delgado, 148 Wn.2d 723, 733, 63 P.3d  792 (2003) (Madsen, J.,  
dissenting)  (citing State v.  Vela, 100 Wn.2d 636, 641, 673 P.2d  185 (1983)).  
As mentioned previously, the defendant argues that under  this definition people 
who are not  qualified, who are incarcerated, who are living abroad, or who are serial 
plaintiffs looking for lawsuits fall under the statute.  It contends that the absurd 
consequences are magnified in the context of class action litigation since nothing  would

15 prevent thousands of individuals from applying to a position they are unqualified for.  
This could potentially result in tremendous class action liability on large and small 
businesses alike.6  Further, defendant argues that  it would incentivize plaintiffs to  commit 
fraud by seeking employment at  businesses they have no interest in  working at , 
meanwhile punishing employers “well beyond any conceivable calculation of the harm 
the EPOA was designed to address.”  Br. of Resp’t at 30.  It asserts that employers will 
be punished for mere mistakes and  that serial plaintiffs who suffered little to no harm will 
recover statutory damages.7  We disagree. 
In order to best effectuate  the statute’s intended purpose of eradicating pay-based 
discrimination, it follows that the term “job applicant” should be more broadly defined.  
Narrowing the term “job applicant” to those who applied for the job in  good faith or have 
a bona fide interest in  obtaining the posted job would shift the onus from employers to 
comply with the EPOA  and put the burden on applicants to  show that they applied in 
good faith despite  not being provided the required pay expectations in the relevant job 
6 Amicus  argues  that allowing  anyone who  submits  a job application  to be entitled  to statutory  damages 
violates  the Fourteenth  Amendment to the United  States  Constitution since  it can result  in severe penalties 
in the class  action  context  that are disproportionate  to the offense.  Amicus  Curiae  Br. by Rest . L. C tr., 
Wash . Hosp . Ass ’n & Int ’l Franchise Ass ’n at 7.  However, this argument  was not raised  by the defendant 
and is  not within  the scope of the  certified  question; therefore,  we decline to consider the issue.   
7 Both  the defendant  and a mici argue  that the  job applicants who  do not  have a good faith  intent  to obtain 
employment  lack  statutory  standing because they are not within  the zone  of interest  protected  by the 
statute  and because they have not suffered  an injury  in fact, economic or otherwise.   We decline  to 
address the standing argument, as  it is beyond the scope of the certified  question.  See Carlsen  v. Glob. 
Client Sols., LLC , 171 Wn.2d 486, 495  n.2, 256  P.3d 321  (2011) (declining to  address  the possibility  of 
preemption  since it is beyond the scope of the  district  court’s certified  question).   The dissent  argues  that 
we silently  address  whether  a legislatively  created  statute  can grant a plaintiff  the right to  sue even  though 
that plaintiff  has suffered  no harm  and is not within  the protected  zone of interest.   We disagree.   Our 
holding is  limited  to interpreting  the term  “job  applicant” in  RCW  49.58.110(4).  However,  we observe 
that if a plaintiff  meets  the definition  of job applicant, the plaintiff  likely  is within  the protected  zone of  
interest.

16 posting.  Further, it is unclear  what it  mean s to be a “good faith” or “bona fide” job 
applicant.  Does it require that a person have all of the qualifications and preferences 
listed in the job posting?  Must the applicant prove they would have accepted the job if 
given an  offer from the employer?  The reality is that many individuals apply for multiple 
job postings when they are seeking employment and may not have all the qualifications 
listed.  To interpret the term “job applicant” in the manner advocated by the defendant would discourage applicants from bringing suit against employers for fear of costly 
litigation and intrusion into their personal lives to prove that they are “bona fide” applicants.   
The legislature did not intend to make it more difficult for job applicants to 
recover for violations of  the EPOA.  Rather, in providing statutory damages as  a potential 
remedy, it intended to hold employers accountable regardless of an  applicant’s ability to  
show actual  damages since proving damages in  these situations is  difficult.  If the 
consequences of violating the plain language of  the EPOA  are too onerous, the legislature 
is in the best position to  
 amend the statute to mitigate the liability employers face.8   
8 Effective  July 27, 2025, RCW  49.58.110 is  amended  to provide employers  an opportunity to  correct  a 
violation of  RCW  49.58.110(1) within  five days  of being notified of the violation  before  a job applicant 
or employee may seek  remedies.   See  LAWS  OF 2025, ch. 383, § 1(b) .  If the employer corrects the posting 
within  five business days  or contacts any applicable third -party  posting entity  with  a demand to  correct  
the job posting, then “neither  the department  nor the  court may assess or award  penalties,  damages,  or 
other relief  . . . for  the violation.”   Id.  This  revision  to the current  statute  addresses  employers’  concerns 
regarding liability  while  maintaining  the burden  on the employer to  comply  with  the EPOA  instead  of 
placing the burden on the plaintiff  to prove their  motive  for applying.  

=== PAGE 17 ===
No. 103394-0 
17 CONCLUSION 
We answer the example raised in the certified question no.  A job applicant 
need  not prove they are a “bona fide” applicant to be deemed a “job applicant.”  
Rather, in accordance with the plain language of RCW 49.58.110(4), a person 
must apply to any solicitation intended to recruit job applicants for a specific 
available position to  be considered a “job applicant,” regardless of the person’s 
subjective intent in applying for the specific position.

No. 103394- 0 
GORDON McCLOUD, J. (dissenting) —Washington’s  Equal Pay and 
Opportunities Act (EPOA ) requires every employer of 15 or more employees to 
disclose the wage scale or salary range and benefits for each job opening it 
advertises. RCW 49.58.110(1). The EPOA then gives every “job applicant or . . 
. employee” the right to sue  for violations of this provision ; the remedies 
include  “statutory damages equal to the actual damages or five thousand dollars, 
whichever is greater.” RCW 49.58.110(4); RCW 49.58.070(1).  
The federal district court has asked us who qualifies as a “job applicant” 
entitled to seek those “actual damages” or that “five thousand dollar s” in 
statutory penalt ies under  RCW 49.58.110(4).  Specifically, it asked whether a 
job applicant must be “bona fide .” 
The majority answers this question “no. ” It holds that any person who 
submits a job application in response to a noncompliant posting is entitled to 
$5,000 worth of statutory damages—even if that person’s sole intent is to 
collect a damages award, not to redress any personal harm and not to obtain an 
offer of employment.

 But the  legislature enacted the EPOA to protect Washington workers and to 
fight employer discrimination . It did not enact the EPOA to give bounty  seekers a n 
incentive to trawl the Internet for noncompliant job postings to obtain  a statutory 
damages award unrelated to any personal harm.  This legislative intent shows  in the 
statute’s language in context,  in its legislative history, and in the relevant agency’s  
interpretation.  The majority’s definition of “job applicant” misconstrues those 
sources, mis states the legislature’s intent, and ends up stretching the meaning of 
“job applicant” to include even plaintiffs who suffered no harm —a class that no 
legislator sought to protect. This conclusion is not true to the statute and will result 
in absurd and unintended consequences.  
I would answer the certified question by defining “job applicant” in RCW 
49.58.110(4) as a person who responds to a job posting for the reason that 
applicants normally apply, that is, to gain an offer  of employment. I would avoid 
using the vague terms “bona fide” or “good faith” in defini ng “job applicant.”  
And I would not define “ applicant ” as one who intends  to take the job  if 
offered —there are countless legitimate reasons for seeking an offer without 
committing in advance to take it (such as using the  offer  as bargaining tool, as an 
opportunity to learn more about the job  duties , or as a time to ask more candid

(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)  
3 questions about benefits). But an applicant must be seeking an offer, not a 
bounty.  
This standard is not that demanding , and a plaintiff’s credible testimony 
alone might well satisfy it. And it  is the most reasonable reading of the term “job 
applicant,” given what the l egislature intended  to do : protect real applicants from 
real harm  and provide incentiv es for employers to comply, while also protecting 
employers from potentially ruinous damages awards unrelated to any harm . 
FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
Plaintiffs Lisa Branson and Cherie Burke are Washington residents who 
applied1 online for retail positions advertised by Washington Fine Wine & Spirits 
LLC , which does business as Total Wine & More (Total Wine). Plaintiffs alleged 
that the job listings , which were posted on Indeed.com, failed to state the wage 
scale for the positions. They sued Total Wine under RCW 49.58.110 on behalf of 
themselves and other similarly situated applicants, seeking class certification and 
statutory damages of $5,000 per class member , among other relief.  
1 A factual dispute exists about whether Branson actually submitted an application.

 After removing the case to federal court, Total Wine sought to bifurcate 
discovery and limit the first phase of discovery to the named plaintiffs’ individual 
claims. Total Wine argued  that Branson and Burke are not “job applicants” within 
the meaning of RCW 49.58.110(4)  because  they applied for  the jobs not to obtain 
employment but only to obtain statutory damages awards . Plaintiffs , on the other 
hand,  argue that the term “job applicant” unambiguously covers any person who 
applies for a job, regardless of i ntent (though both named plaintiffs in this case 
allege that they applied for the positions in good faith with the intent to gain 
employment  as long as the wage scale met their needs).  
Several Western District of Washington federal judges have previously ruled 
that a job applicant under RCW 49.58.110(4) must allege at least “that they applied 
for the job with good -faith intent.”  Floyd v. Insight Glob. LLC , No. 23 -cv-1680 -
BJR, 2024 WL 2133370 , at *8  (W.D. Wash. May 10, 2024)  (court order) , amended 
on reconsideration, 2024 WL 3199858 (W.D. Wash. June 26, 2024)  (court order) ; 
see also  Wright v. HP Inc. , No. 2:24 -cv-01261 -MJP, 2024 WL 4678268 (W.D. 
Wash. Nov. 5, 2024)  (court order) . In this case, however, the federal  court  
determined that Washington courts have not yet decided the meaning of “job 
applicant”  in this statute . It therefore certified the following question to us:  “What 
must a Plaintiff prove to be deemed a ‘job applicant ’ within the meaning of RCW

 49.58.110(4)? For example, must they prove that they are a ‘ bona fide ’ applicant? ”

(Ord. Certifying Question to Wash. State Sup.  Ct.).  
ANALYSIS  
The legislature enacted  RCW 49.58.110 to  provide  wage and benefit 
information to individuals for whom that information is relevant —that is , to 
workers seeking a job offer . Interpreting the statute to cover individuals for whom 
that information is totally irrelevant —that is , persons with no interest in a job 
offer —flouts that legislative intent . I would therefore answer the certified question 
as follows: a “job applicant” under RCW 49.58.110(4) is a person who responds to 
a job posting by submitting an application with the intent to gain an offer of 
employment.  
I. The most reasonable interpretation of RCW 49.58.110(4)’s p lain 
language in context is that “job applicant” means a person who submits a 
job application with the intent to obtain a job offer  
This case requires us to interpret the statutory term “job applicant.”   The 
“fundamental objective” of statutory interpretation is to “ascertain and carry out 
the Legislature’s intent.” Dep ’t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC , 146 Wn.2d 
1, 9-10, 43 P.3d 4 (2002). To determine the plain meaning of a statute,  we consider  
“the text of the provision in question, the context of the statute in which the

(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)

 provision is found, related provisions, amendments to the provision, and the 
statutory scheme as a whole.” Ass’n of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs. v. Wash. State Liquor Control Bd., 182 Wn.2d 342, 350, 340 P.3d 849 (2015) (citing 
Campbell & Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at 9-10).  If a statute’s meaning is plain on its face, 
we will give effect to that meaning as an expression of legislative intent. Campbell 
& Gwinn, 146 Wn.2d at 9 -10. If the statute is susceptible to more than one 
reasonable interpretation after this inquiry, it is ambiguous, and we may consider extratextual materials to help determine legislative intent, including legislative history and agency interpretation. Five Corners Fam. Farmers v. State , 173 Wn.2d 
296, 306, 268 P.3d 892 (2011)  (quoting Rest. Dev., Inc. v. Cananwill, Inc. , 150 
Wn.2d 674, 682, 80 P.3d 598 (2003)) ; Bostain  v. Food  Express, Inc. , 159 Wn.2d 
700, 716, 153 P.3d 846 (2007)  (collecting cases) . 
A. Plain meaning in context shows the legislature intended to protect 
workers seeking job opportunities  
The current version of RCW 49.58.110 provides, in relevant part:  
(1) The employer must disclose in each posting for each job opening 
the wage scale or salary range, and a general description of all of the benefits and other compensation to be offered to the hired applicant. 
For the purposes of this section, “posting” me ans any solicitation 
intended to recruit job applicants for a specific available position, 
including recruitment done directly by an employer or indirectly through a third party, and includes any postings done electronically, or

 with a printed hard copy, that includes qualifications for desired 
applicants.  
. . . . 
(4) A job applicant or an employee  is entitled to the remedies in 
RCW 49.58.060 and 49.58.070 for violations of this section. . . . 
(Emphasis added.)  
Since t he statute does not define the term  “job applicant,”  and it does not 
seem to be a term of art, we first consider dictionary definitions to determine  its 
plain meaning. State v. Valdiglesias LaValle , 2 Wn.3d 310, 319, 535 P.3d 856 
(2023).  As the majority notes, an “applicant ” is “‘one who applies for something  : 
one who makes a usu [ally] formal request esp[ecially] for something of benefit to 
himself .’” Majority at 6 (quoting W EBSTER ’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL 
DICTIONARY  105 (2002)) . Plaintiffs argue that the legislature’s use of the term “job 
applicant” without any modifiers indicates that the term means “an individual who 
applied to a job posting.” Opening Br. of Pl s./Appellants (Opening Br.)  at 59.  
Plaintiffs note that the legislature used the modifier “bona fide” in other  
employment statutes, suggesting that the legislature’s decision to omit  such 
language from  RCW 49.58.110(1) was intentional. Id. at 26 -27.2  
 
2 See, e.g., RCW 49.58.020(3)(b) (providing a civil penalty for gender -based wage 
discrimination but excluding from the definition of “discrimination” differences in pay 
attributable to “bona fide job-related factor[s]” like education, training, experience, 
seniority or merit systems).

 Plaintiffs’ interpretation is certainly plausible. But when interpreting a 
statute, we  must  consider the words “in the context of the statute in which they 
appear, not in isolation or subject to all possible meanings found in a dictionary.” 
State v. Lilyblad, 163 Wn.2d 1, 9, 177 P.3d 686 (2008); Green v. Pierce County , 
197 Wn.2d 841, 853, 487 P.3d 499 (2021) (citing Campbell & Gwinn , 146 Wn.2d 
at 11 -12)). Thus, when interpreting statutory terms, we “‘take into consideration 
the meaning naturally attaching to them from the context, and  . . . adopt the sense 
of the words which best harmonizes with the context.’” State v. Roggenkamp , 153 
Wn.2d 614, 623, 106 P.3d 196 (2005) (alteration in original) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting State v. Jackson , 137 Wn.2d 712, 729, 976 P.2d 1229 
(1999)). We must therefore examine the term in the context of the statute, related 
statutory provisions, and the entire statutory scheme. Id .  
First, let’s step back to consider the overarching purpose of the  EPOA’s 
statutory scheme . Fortunately, the legislature explained the EPOA’s purpose  in its 
statement of intent. The legislature enacted the EPOA  to “address income 
disparities, employer discrimination, and retaliation practices, and to reflect the 
equal status of all workers in Washington state.” RCW 49.58.005(2). One  stated 
purpose of the law is to address the “gap in wages and advancement opportunities 
among workers in Washington, especially women.” RCW 49.58.005(1). The 

=== PAGE 26 ===

(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)  
 
 
 
9 
 requirement that employers provide wage and salary information to applicants and 
employees is part of this goal of moving “towards gender equality.” RCW 49.58.005(4). These statements of intent show that the legislature wants to protect 
workers seeking jobs and career advancement opportunities and to equalize bargaining power , especially for historically marginalized groups. These 
statements show no  intent to benefit persons who are  not actually seeking a job 
offer or career advancement opportunity.  
Next,  we move to RCW 49.58.110, the specific statute at issue here . 
Originally, the statute provided that “[a]n individual” is entitled to remedies for violations of the disclosure law.  Former RCW 49.58.110( 5) (2019) . But in 20 22, 
the legislature amended the statute  to limit the availability of relief : it removed the 
term “individual” and replaced it with “[a] job applicant or an employee.” RCW 
49.58.110(4) ; L
AWS OF  2022, ch. 242, § 1. This change  reflects legislative intent to 
limit relief to those who have some real stake in getting a job offer.  
The majority agrees that the EPOA is clearly intended to protect workers 
and those seeking work or  advancement opportunities. Majority at 8- 9. But the 
majority fails to  explain how its literal interpretation of “job applicant” furthers 
that intent. Considering the term in the  full context of the EPOA  militates in favor 
of the conclusion that  “job applicant” in RCW 49.58.110 means one of the people 

=== PAGE 27 ===

(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)  
 
 
 
10 
 whom the legislation was designed to protect: a person who has an interest in 
obtaining an offer of employment.  
B. We avoid literal interpretation of undefined statutory terms that lead 
to absurd results  
Total Wine argues that plaintiffs’ interpretation of “job applicant” leads to 
absurd consequences.  “Where the legislature provides no statutory definition and a 
court gives a term its plain and ordinary meaning by reference to a dictionary, the 
court ‘will avoid literal reading of a statute which would result in unlikely, absurd, 
or strained consequenc es.’” Tingey v. Haisch , 159 Wn.2d 652, 663 -64, 152 P.3d 
1020 (2007) (quoting Fraternal Ord.  of Eagles, Tenino Aerie No. 564 v. Grand 
Aerie of Fraternal Ord.  of Eagles, 148 Wn.2d 224, 239, 5 9 P.3d 655 (2002)). We 
do not presume that the legislature intends  absurd results.  State v. J.P. , 149 W n.2d 
444, 450, 69 P.3d 318 (2003) (quoting State v. Delgado,  148 W n.2d 723, 733, 63 
P.3d 792 (2003) (Madsen, J., dissenting)).   
But t he majority’s literal interpretation of “job applicant” risks just such 
absurd consequence s: it incentivizes persons with no interest in getting a  job offer 
to search for noncompliant job postings for the purpose of  obtain ing a statutory 
damages award. Depending on how popular a job posting is, employers could be 
exposed to nearly limitless class action liability for a single noncompliant job 

=== PAGE 28 ===
Branson v. Wash. Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC , No. 103394- 0 
(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)  
 
 
 
11 
 posting.   I agree with Total Wine  that it would be absurd to conclude that the 
legislature intended to incentivize plaintiffs to “‘seek [] employment’ at businesses 
where they have no real interest in working” or to “punish[] employers well 
beyond any conceivable calculation of the harm the EPOA was designed to 
address.” Answering Br. of Resp’t- Def. Wash. Fine Wine & Spirits,  LLC  at 30.  
To be sure,  the prospect of exposure to  a hefty damages award provides a 
strong incentive for employers to comply with the law.  Reply  Br. of 
Pls./Appellants (Reply Br.) at 1 4. But the majority’s decision to interpret “job 
applicant” so expansively that any person in the world can qualify as an applicant —regardless of whether they fall within the class to be protected or 
whether they have suffered any harm —goes too far .
 3  
 
3 It also silently decides a major constitutional question: can a legislatively created 
statute grant a plaintiff the right to sue even though that plaintiff has suffered no harm or 
threat of harm and even thought that plaintiff falls outside the class of people whom the 
statute was designed to protect? The United States Supreme Court says no, under federal 
law: “Injury in fact is a constitutional requirement, and ‘[i]t is settled that Congress 
cannot erase Article III’s standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to 
a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 
330, 339, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 (2016) (alteration in original) (quoting 
Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 n.3, 117 S. Ct. 2312, 138 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1997)). 
Washington courts suggest that the answer is no, under Washington law: “Generally, one 
must be protected by the provision of a statute to gain standing to sue for a violation of 
the provision.” McFarland v. Tompkins, 34 Wn. App. 2d 280, 301, 567 P.3d 1128 (2025). 
We typically interpret statutes to avoid any question about their constitutionality. Utter ex rel. State v. Bldg. Indus. Ass’n of Wash., 182 Wn.2d 398, 434, 341 P.3d 953 (2015) 
(citing State v. Robinson, 153 Wn.2d 689, 693 -94, 107 P.3d 90 (2005)). The majority,

 Plaintiffs contend that interpreting “job applicant” to require intent to accept 
an offer would be absurd because  applicants cannot form intent to accept an offer 
without knowing the compensation. Reply Br. at 10. I agree that defining “job 
applicant” as one who applies with an already -formed intent to accept  a job offer is 
too limiting.  But interpreting “job applicant” to mean a person with intent to obtain  
a job offer avoids that pitfall and furthers the EPOA’s purpose of equalizing 
negotiating power  and protecting applicants who lack such power .  
Thus, statutory language in context , including the legislature’s statement of 
intent, compel s the conclusion that “job applicant” means  a person who submits a 
job application with the intent to obtain a job offer. But even if the statute were 
ambiguous, legislative history and agency interpretation confirm that the 
legislat ure enacted this statute to protect workers seeking job opportunities, not 
individuals seeking a statutory bounty unrelated to any harm suffered. I discuss this 
in the next section.  
 
 
 
however, interprets the statute at issue in this case in a way that poses a serious question 
about its constitutionality.

 II. Even if the statute is ambiguous, legislative history and agency 
interpretation show that the legislature  intended  to protect workers 
seeking job opportunities, not to protect individuals seeking statutory bount ies unrelated to harm suffered  
If a statute is ambiguous, we may look to legislative history to determine 
legislative intent. Five Corners Fam . Farmers, 173 Wn.2d at  306. And, while we 
retain ultimate authority to interpret a statute, we may place weight  on an agency’s 
interpretation of an ambiguous statute if “the particular agency is charged with the 
administration and enforcement of the statute” and “the statute falls within the 
agency’s special expertise.” Bostain , 159 Wn.2d at 716 (collecting cases) . Here, 
those sources —legislative history and agency interpretation—compel the 
conclusion that the legislature intended RCW 49.58.110 to protect job applicants 
with a real i nterest in obtaining an offer of employment.  
A. Legislative history  
The legislative history for S .B. 5761,4 the 2022 bill that amended RCW 
49.58.110 to include the “job applicant” limitation, support s the conclusion that the 
legislature  intended to protect workers by equalizing the playing field during the 
job search and increasing workers’ bargaining power. S .B. 5761’s sponsor, former 
Senator Emily Randall, consistently used the term “job seekers,” meaning real

 applicants, as opposed to someone who has no interest in a job offer.5 For example, 
during floor debates, the former senator explained that “we’ve got a lot of job 
seekers who are trying to make the right decisions for themselves and their 
families” and stated that the bill is about, in part, “job seekers who should be able 
to have all of the relevant information before they apply for a job.”6 Bill cosponsor 
Senator Lisa Wellman emphasized that the bill’s pay disclosure requirement would 
help low- wage hourly workers decide if applying for a job and taking time off to 
travel to an interview would make financial sense.7 
Comments by other legislators—although given less weight than the 
sponsors’ statements, Wilmot  v. Kaiser  Alum . & Chem.  Corp. , 118 Wn.2d 46, 63, 
821 P.2d 18 (1991) —reflect the same concern about applicants who are actually 
pursuing job offer s. See, e.g. , testimony of former Rep resentative  Noel Frame

considerable weight.’” Wash. Bankers Ass’n v. Dep’t of Revenue, 198 Wn.2d 418, 445,

The final bill report s for E NGROSSED SUBSTITUTE  S.B. 5761, the 2022 bill 
that amended RCW 49.58.110,  also support this conclusion.9 The final House and 
Senate bill reports both contain summar ies of testimony (which would have been 
available to the full legislature when later voting on the bill) suggesting that the bill 
was intended to “help prospective employees make decisions” and avoid wasting 
time applying for and interviewing for positions whose salary would be inadequate. S.B.
 REP. ON ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE  S.B. 5761,  at 3. Both bill reports

Bill Report notes that the amendment “allows a discussion at the start of the 
process instead of after an offer has been made, which will increase the ability to negotiate pay.” H.B.

 the same thing.” S.B.  REP. ON ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE  S.B. 5761 , at 3. These 
comments suggest that the bill was intended to protect  real job seekers—
“prospective employees,” particularly those who have been historically 
disadvantaged, who need pay information to “negotiat[e]” with an employer to 
obtain fair compensation. Id.10 These comments also suggest  that the bill was 
designed  to apply to workers seeking to use a job offer for negotiating purposes.   
These bill reports also show the reason that the legislature  decided  to replace 
RCW 49.58.110(4)’s term “individual” with the terms “job applicant or 
employee .” The Department of Labor & Industries ( L&I) itself proposed this 
change specifically to limit the class of would -be plaintiffs, because without that 
modification, “anyone may file a complaint, not just applicants or employees.” 
S.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE  S.B. 5761 , at 3. Once again , this strongly 
suggests that the legislat ure inten ded to narrow the class of persons  entitled to a 
remedy to those with a real stake in the matter.

2024 that would have amended RCW 49.58.110 to add a section defining “job

 applicant” as “a person who has made and submitted a bona fide application for 
employment.” Opening Br. at 4 3 (citing S.B. 6241, 68th Leg. , Reg. Sess. (Wash. 
2024);  H.B. 2349, 68th Leg. , Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2024)). Plaintiffs point out that  
neither bill advanced past nomination, id., suggesting to plaintiffs that the 
legislature endorsed a broad reading of “job applicant.”  But w e “generally decline 
to speculate as to why the Legislature rejects a proposed amendment, ” “even where 
an actual bill is before the Legislature.” In re Pers. Restraint of Andress, 147 
Wn.2d 602, 611, 56 P.3d 981 (2002) (citing Spokane County  Health Dist. v. 
Brockett , 120 Wn.2d 140, 153, 839 P.2d 324 (1992)). Here, the legislature did not 
even “reject” the bills by vote; the bills failed to advance to a vote. Our precedent 
bars us from giving  any weight to these failed bills or the hypothetical reasons that 
they might have failed.  
In sum, the legislative history strongly suggests intent to protect workers 
actually seeking job offers, period.   
B. L&I’s interpretation 
The interpretation of the phrase “job applicant” by the very agency that 
proposed its addition to the statute—L&I—compels the same conclusion. While 
we retain ultimate authority to interpret a statute, we may place weight on an

 agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute if “the particular agency is charged 
with the administration and enforcement of the statute ” and “the statute falls within 
the agency’ s special expertise.” Bostain , 159 Wn.2d at 716; City of Redmond  v. 
Cent.  Puget  Sound  Growth  Mgmt.  Hr’gs Bd., 136 Wn.2d 38, 46, 959 P.2d 1091 
(1998) . L&I meets both requirements, so its interpretation of “job applicant” is 
persuasive.11  
“Although agency policies do not have the force of law, this court can look 
to them to interpret statutes with undefined terms.” Richardson v. Dep’t of Lab. & 
Indus. , 6 Wn. App. 2d 896, 909 & n.38 , 432 P.3d 841 (2018) (citing Stevens v. 
Brink’s Home Sec. , Inc., 162 Wn.2d 42, 54, 169 P.3d 473 (2007) (Madsen, J., 
concurring)). Total Wine points to L&I policy materials that support its contention 
that a “job applicant” under RCW 49.58.110(4) must be one who has a real interest 
in obtaining a job offer.  For example, the cover sheet for the EPOA complaint 
form states, “L&I will investigate complaints filed by applicants who have applied 
to a job in good faith with the intent of gaining employment.” WASH. DEP’T OF 
 
11 The majority argues that we should not place weight on L&I’s interpretation of 
“job applicant” because the legislature did not grant L&I rulemaking authority with 
regard to RCW 49.58.110(4). Majority at 12; Reply Br. at 30. But the legislature did 
grant rule making authority to L&I to enforce RCW 49.58.060. RCW 49.58.090. 
Interpreting “job applicant” is a necessary part of L&I’s enforcement of RCW 49.58.060, 
since that statute applies to job applicants and employees. RCW 49.58.110(4).

https://lni.wa.gov/forms- publications/F700 -200-000.pdf  [https://perma.cc/FH2P -
2CWL].  Other L&I materials confirm that the agency “will investigate complaints 
filed only by applicants who have applied to jobs in good faith with the intent of 
gaining employment” and that “L&I will generally only assess damages when an 
applicant can establish that they have been harmed by the posting.”  Equal Pay &

https://lni.wa.gov/workers -rights/wages/equal -pay-opportunities-act/equal- pay-

materials also state that “[a] formal complaint should be submitted if a person has 
applied to an available position in good faith with the intent of gaining 
employment and believes the job posting does not comply with the job posting 
requirements.” Id. By contrast, if a person “sees a job posting they believe does not 
comply with the [EPOA]  pay transparency requirements, but they do not intend to 
 
12 L&I policy materials also state that “All applicants, including existing 
employees, who apply to a posting recruiting Washington-based employees . . . are 
protected by the law.” W ASH. DEP’T OF LAB. & INDUS ., ADMIN . POLICY  ES.E.1, at 4 
(L&I Employment Standards), https://www.lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/_docs/ese1.pdf [https://perma.cc/ZU66-GZA2]; Reply Br. at 31 (quoting EPOA Q&A). Plaintiffs argue 
that this broad phrasing supports their expansive reading of “job applicant.” But read in 
the context explained above, the most reasonable conclusion is that that L&I interprets 
“job applicant” as a person who needs to be “protected by the law”—that would be a 
person with a real interest in obtaining a job offer.

 apply for the available position or do not wish to file a formal complaint,” the 
person should submit a tip. Id. This language suggests that L&I interprets “job 
applicant” as a person with a real interest in obtaining a job offer.  
It is certainly true that i n September 2024,  L&I published preliminary draft 
rule language that would have defined the term “applicant” as an individual “who 
submits in good faith an application for a job posting with the intent of gaining 
employment.” Pls./Appellants’ Statement  of Additional Auths. , Attach. A at 1. 
And i n October  2024 , seven members of the House of Representatives sent a 
public comment letter requesting that L&I amend its  proposed definition because 
“[r]equiring a job applicant to prove subjective ‘intent’ adds a new element to the cause of action in order to access remedies [and]  would frustrate a key purpose of 
the statute .” Id., Attach. B. After that, L&I removed the definition of “applicant” 
from its next draft. Id. , Attach. C  at 1.  
The majority interprets L&I’s  amend ment to that draft rule language as an 
indication that L&I does not interpret “job applicant” to mean a person with a real 
stake in obtaining a job. But L&I did not change the language on the  EPOA  
complaint form , on the informational Q&A website , or in the administrative policy 
statement discussed above.  In those published materials, L&I continues to express 
the view that a job applicant is a person with a real stake in the application process.

 Further, statements  by individual legislators that postdate  enactment of a bill—like 
this letter from seven members of the House of Representatives written and sent 
well after the enactment of RCW 49.58.110(4) and its “job applicant” limitation— 
“should not be viewed as a reflection of legislative intent. ” Nelson v. McClatchy 
Newspapers, Inc ., 131 Wn.2d 523, 532 n.5 , 936 P.2d 1123 (1997 ) (legislators’ 
statements about a bill several years after its passage “should not be viewed as a reflection of legislative intent”  (citing State v. Leek , 26 Wn . App. 651, 657 -58, 614 
P.2d 209 (1980) )). Thus, I would decline to give these representatives’ statements, 
and L&I’s subsequent  withdrawal of its proposed narrowing definition of 
“applicant ,” such dispositive  weight.  
C
ONCLUSION  
The statutory language, context, statement of purpose, and history show that 
the legislature enacted the EPOA to protect workers seeking job offers.  Those 
sources also show that the legislature accomplished that goal by requiring 
employers to provide such workers with the pay and benefit information that is 
relevant to a job search or a salary negotiation. There is nothing in the statutory 
language, context, statement of purpose, or legislative history suggesting that the 
legislature had any intent to incen tivize individuals to search the web for 
noncompliant postings in order to reap a reward unrelated to actual harm.  

=== PAGE 39 ===

(Gordon McCloud, J., dissenting)  
22 I therefore respectfully dissent. I would answer the certified question as 
follows: A “job applicant” is “a person who responds to a job posting by 
submitting an application with the intent to gain an offer of employment.”  This 
interpretation is supported by the statutory text, context, legislative history, and relevant agency interpretation.  This definition would ensure that the EPOA 
remains accessible to those  whom  it was intended to protect—real job applicants 
and employees who need pay information to make critical decisions. It would al so 
ensure that the EPOA does not cause  the unintended  consequences that result from 
the majority’s conclusion.
