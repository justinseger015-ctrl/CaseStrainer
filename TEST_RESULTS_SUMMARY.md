  - "of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wa" (truncated/garbled)
- **Status**: ❌ FAIL - Significant case name issues

### Test 5: Parallel Citation Detection ❌
- **Result**: 0% detection rate (0/4 known pairs)
- **Issue**: None of the known parallel citation pairs were linked
- **Known pairs tested**:
  - 183 Wash.2d 649 ↔ 355 P.3d 258 (not linked)
  - 174 Wash.2d 619 ↔ 278 P.3d 173 (not linked)
  - 159 Wash.2d 700 ↔ 153 P.3d 846 (not linked)
  - 137 Wash.2d 712 ↔ 976 P.2d 1229 (not linked)
- **Status**: ❌ FAIL - Parallel detection failing

---

## 📊 **Overall Score: 57% (4/7 Tests Passing)**

### What's Working ✅
1. **Citation extraction** - Finding the right number of citations
2. **Canonical data** - 100% population rate for verified citations
3. **Verification** - 89% verification rate
4. **Known citations** - Finding 80% of expected citations

### What's Broken ❌
1. **Clustering** - Completely broken (0 clusters)
2. **Case name quality** - 62% of citations have issues
3. **Parallel detection** - Not linking parallel citations

---

## 🔍 **Detailed Findings**

### Issue 1: Clustering System Broken
**Evidence**:
- 45 citations have `parallel_citations` arrays
- 0 clusters returned
- All citations have `cluster_id: null`

**Impact**: Frontend cannot group related citations

**Root Cause**: Clustering master creates clusters but doesn't update citation objects (as identified in SYNC_VS_ASYNC_SUMMARY.md)

### Issue 2: Case Name Extraction Poor Quality
**Evidence**:
- 26/55 citations (47%) have empty/N/A case names
- 8/55 citations (15%) have truncated names
- Total issue rate: 61.8%

**Examples**:
```
"Inc. v. Robins" - Corporate name truncation
"of Wash. Spirits & Wine Distribs . v. Wa" - Severe truncation
```

**Impact**: Users cannot identify cases without canonical data

**Root Cause**: Master extractor not fixing truncated names (as identified in SYNC_VS_ASYNC_SUMMARY.md)

### Issue 3: Parallel Citation Linking Broken
**Evidence**:
- Citations have `parallel_citations` arrays
- But citations are not linked bidirectionally
- 0% of known pairs properly linked

**Impact**: Cannot identify which citations refer to the same case

**Root Cause**: Parallel detection creates arrays but doesn't establish proper relationships

## 🎯 **Validation Against Previous Analysis**

### Confirms SYNC_VS_ASYNC_SUMMARY.md Findings

| Finding | Test Result | Confirmed |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Canonical data working | 100% rate | ✅ YES |
| Clustering broken | 0 clusters | ✅ YES |
| Case name truncation | 62% issues | ✅ YES |
| Verification working | 89% rate | ✅ YES |

**Conclusion**: The automated test **confirms** all findings from the manual analysis.

## 🔧 **Priority Fixes Needed**

### Priority 1: Fix Clustering (CRITICAL)
- **Test**: Test 3 failing
- **Impact**: 0 clusters despite 45 parallel citations
- **Fix**: Update citation objects after clustering (before serialization)

### Priority 2: Fix Case Name Extraction (HIGH)
- **Test**: Test 4 failing (62% issue rate)
- **Impact**: Most citations have poor quality names
- **Fix**: Debug master extractor, improve truncation detection

### Priority 3: Fix Parallel Citation Linking (HIGH)
- **Test**: Test 5 failing (0% detection)
- **Impact**: Cannot identify related citations
- **Fix**: Ensure bidirectional linking of parallel citations
