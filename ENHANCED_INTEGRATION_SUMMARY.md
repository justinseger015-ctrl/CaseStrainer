# Enhanced Citation Processor Integration Summary

## Overview
The enhanced case name extractor has been successfully integrated into all CaseStrainer pipelines, providing improved citation analysis with canonical case name lookup from both CourtListener API and Google Scholar (via SerpApi), similarity scoring, and proper linking to authoritative sources.

## Key Features Integrated

### 1. Enhanced Case Name Extraction
- **Extracted Case Names**: Extracts case names directly from document text using advanced regex patterns
- **Canonical Case Names**: Retrieves authoritative case names from CourtListener API v4 and Google Scholar
- **Dual-Source Lookup**: Primary lookup in CourtListener, fallback to Google Scholar for academic/scholarly citations
- **Similarity Scoring**: Calculates similarity between extracted and canonical names (0.0-1.0)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for extraction methods
- **Extraction Methods**: Tracks which method was used (extracted_api_confirmed, extracted_api_mismatch, extracted_only, etc.)
- **Source Tracking**: Identifies whether canonical names came from CourtListener or Google Scholar

### 2. API Integration

#### CourtListener API v4
- **Primary Source**: Uses citation-lookup endpoint for canonical name retrieval
- **Legal Database**: Comprehensive legal case database
- **Caching**: Implements Redis and SQLite caching for improved performance
