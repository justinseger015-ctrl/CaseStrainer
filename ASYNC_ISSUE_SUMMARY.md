# Async Processing Issue Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: 🔴 PARTIALLY BROKEN - Sync works, Async stuck  
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Sync processing**: Works perfectly (<3s for small docs)
- **Text input** (<5KB): Processes sync successfully
- **API endpoint**: Responds correctly
- **Workers**: Running and listening
- **Redis**: Healthy and connected

### ❌ What's Broken
- **Async processing**: Jobs stuck at "Initializing" (16%)
- **Large text** (>5KB): Should go async but gets stuck
- **URL uploads**: Get stuck (PDF→text conversion works, but async fails)
- **File uploads**: Likely same issue

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
1. Jobs ARE being created in Redis with `status="started"`
2. Jobs are NOT being added to the worker queue
3. Workers never pick up the jobs
4. Processing code (`process_any_input`) is **NOT being called**

### Evidence
- Added extensive ERROR-level logging to:
  - `process_any_input()` - NOT appearing in logs
  - `_process_citations_unified()` - NOT appearing in logs
  - `queue.enqueue()` - NOT appearing in logs

- Only logs showing up:
  - Status check requests
  - Health checks
  - No job submission logs

### What This Means
The API endpoint is creating job objects in Redis **without calling the normal processing flow**. There's a code path we haven't identified that's creating orphaned jobs.

## 🔧 Changes Made (Session Summary)

### 1. Fixed Redis Port ✅
**File**: `.env`
```
REDIS_PORT=6380 → 6379
```
**Result**: Backend can now connect to Redis properly

### 2. Fixed Rate Limit Infinite Loop ✅  
**File**: `src/unified_verification_master.py`
- Added rate limit detection
- Prevent fallback when rate limited
- Stop infinite retry loops

**Result**: Sync processing no longer hangs

### 3. Re-enabled Verification ✅
**File**: `.env`
```
ENABLE_VERIFICATION=True
```
**Result**: Citations get verified when processed

### 4. Added Comprehensive Logging 🚧
**Files**: `src/unified_input_processor.py`
- Added ERROR-level logs to trace execution
- Logging not appearing → Code not executing

---

##  Missing Piece

**The async job creation happens somewhere OTHER than `unified_input_processor.py`**

Possibilities:
1. Vue API endpoint has alternate code path
2. Progress manager creates jobs differently  
3. There's cached/old code being executed
4. Docker volumes not mounting properly

---

## 📋 Test Results

### Sync Tests
```bash
python test_api_direct.py
✅ Status: 200
✅ Time: 2.2s
✅ Citations: 1
✅ Verified: Yes
```

### Async Tests  
```bash
python test_async_final.py        # Large text (18KB)
python test_simple_async.py       # Medium text (6.7KB)
python test_user_url.py           # URL (PDF)
```
**All tests**:
- ❌ Stuck at "Initializing" (16%)
- ❌ Never progress past initial step
- ❌ Timeout after 60 seconds
- ❌ Workers show no activity

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (For Tomorrow)

### Immediate Investigation
1. **Find where jobs are actually being created**
   - Search for direct Redis job creation
   - Check if vue_api_endpoints.py bypasses process_any_input
   - Look for alternate enqueueing logic

2. **Verify Docker volume mounts**
   - Ensure code changes are being picked up
   - Check if old code is cached

3. **Test with explicit logging in API endpoint**
   - Add logging directly in vue_api_endpoints.py
   - Trace the exact code path being taken

### Potential Solutions
1. **If alternate code path found**: Fix that path
2. **If volume mount issue**: Rebuild containers
3. **If cached code**: Clear Python cache, restart fresh

## 💡 Workaround (Current)

**For immediate use:**
1. Keep documents < 5KB (will process sync)
2. Or break large documents into smaller chunks
3. Sync processing is fully functional

## 📝 Key Files

### Modified Files
- `d:/dev/casestrainer/.env` - Redis port, verification enabled
- `src/unified_verification_master.py` - Rate limit fix
- `src/unified_input_processor.py` - Added logging (not executing)

### Test Files Created
- `test_api_direct.py` - Sync test (works)
- `test_async_final.py` - Async test (fails)
- `test_simple_async.py` - Quick async test (fails)
- `test_user_url.py` - URL test (fails)
- `test_rate_limit.py` - Rate limit stress test (works)

## 🐛 Debug Commands

### Check if job exists
```powershell
docker exec casestrainer-redis-prod redis-cli -a caseStrainerRedis123 --no-auth-warning KEYS rq:job:JOB_ID
```

### Check job status
```powershell
docker exec casestrainer-redis-prod redis-cli -a caseStrainerRedis123 --no-auth-warning HGET rq:job:JOB_ID status
```

### Check queue
```powershell
docker exec casestrainer-redis-prod redis-cli -a caseStrainerRedis123 --no-auth-warning LLEN rq:queue:casestrainer
```

### Check worker logs
```powershell
docker logs casestrainer-rqworker1-prod --tail 50
```

### Check backend logs
```powershell
docker logs casestrainer-backend-prod --tail 100 --since 2m
```

## ✅ Session Achievements

1. **Fixed verification infinite loop** - System no longer hangs
2. **Fixed Redis connection** - Backend can connect properly  
3. **Sync processing working** - Users can process small documents
4. **Identified root cause** - Jobs created but not enqueued
5. **Comprehensive logging added** - Ready for tomorrow's debug

---

**Bottom Line**: Sync works great. Async broken because jobs aren't being enqueued through the normal code path. Need to find where they're actually being created and fix that location.
