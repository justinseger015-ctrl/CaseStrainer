American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310 U. S. 534, 544 (1940); see also Social Security Bd. v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358, 369 (1946); Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB, 321 U. S. 678, 681–682, n. 1 (1944). The Court understood, in the words of Justice Brandeis, that \"[t]he supremacy of law demands that there shall be opportunity to have some court decide whether an erroneous rule of law was applied.\" St. Joseph Stock Yards, 298 U. S., at 84 (concurring opinion). It also continued to note, as it long had, that the informed judgment of the Executive Branch—especially in the form of an interpretation issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute—could be entitled to \"great weight.\" American Trucking Assns., 310 U. S., at 549."}
