# Next Steps After Fix #43 Success

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### Major Win: Extraction Contamination Resolved
- **16 fixes** deployed to resolve "183 Wn.2d 649" bug
- **Root cause:** Text normalization shifting positions
- **Solution:** FIX #43 - Use original text with original indices
- **Result:** Perfect data separation achieved!

### Consolidation Planning
- ‚úÖ Documented all extraction functions (see `CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`)
- ‚úÖ Added deprecation warnings to unused extractors
- ‚úÖ Identified production function: `UnifiedCaseExtractionMaster`

## üéØ PRIORITY ISSUES FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Clustering - Parallel Citations Being Split (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Citations that should be together are in separate clusters:
- "192 Wn.2d 453" + "430 P.3d 655" (Washington reporter + Pacific reporter)
- "146 Wn.2d 1" + "43 P.3d 4"
- "199 Wn.2d 528" + "509 P.3d 818"

**Current Logic** (`src/unified_clustering_master.py` line 554):
```python
# If same reporter, they can't be parallel (must be different reporters)
if reporter1 == reporter2:
    return False
```

**Potential Issues:**
1. Reporter detection may be identifying "Wn.2d" and "P.3d" as different types correctly
2. BUT proximity check or other heuristics might be failing
3. OR extracted case names might be different, preventing clustering

**Investigation Needed:**
- [ ] Check what `_match_parallel_patterns()` is matching
- [ ] Verify proximity threshold is appropriate
- [ ] Check if extracted case names match for these parallel pairs
- [ ] Test: Are these citations extracted with same `extracted_case_name`?

**Recommended Fix Strategy:**
1. Add debug logging to `_are_citations_parallel_pair` for Washington citations
2. Test with "192 Wn.2d 453" specifically
3. Identify which check is failing (proximity? case name? reporter type?)
4. Adjust the failing check

### 2. API Verification - Wrong Cases Being Returned (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** CourtListener API returns wrong cases for some citations:
- '182 Wn.2d 342' ‚Üí Returns "Ass'n of Wash. Spirits" but document has "State v. Velasquez"
- '9 P.3d 655' ‚Üí Returns Mississippi case instead of Washington "Fraternal Order"
- '199 Wn.2d 528' ‚Üí Returns wrong case from 2023

**Current Logic** (`src/unified_verification_master.py`):
- Uses `_find_best_matching_cluster_sync()` with name similarity checks
- FIX #26 already applied to improve matching

**Potential Issues:**
1. CourtListener database has multiple cases with same citation
2. Our matching prioritizes first result too heavily
3. No jurisdiction filtering (WA vs other states)
4. Year mismatches not weighted enough

**Recommended Fix Strategy:**
1. Add jurisdiction filter (prioritize WA cases for WA citations)
2. Add year proximity scoring (closer years = better match)
3. Require minimum name similarity threshold (e.g., > 0.5)
4. Log all API results to see if correct case is in the list

### 3. Extraction Quality - Some "N/A" Results (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Some citations extracting "N/A" for case names
- Mostly affects Westlaw (WL) citations
- Some edge cases

**Impact:** Low - doesn't break functionality, just missing data

**Recommended Approach:**
- Defer until clustering and verification are fixed
- May resolve automatically if those are fixed
- Consider separate extraction strategy for WL citations

## üìã CONSOLIDATION TASKS (TECH DEBT - NOT URGENT)

### Short Term
- [ ] Audit all imports - ensure using `UnifiedCaseExtractionMaster`
- [ ] Add `@deprecated` decorators to old functions
- [ ] Create migration guide for any custom code

### Long Term  
- [ ] Extract all unique regex patterns from all extractors
- [ ] Benchmark patterns on test dataset
- [ ] Keep only best-performing patterns
- [ ] Remove deprecated code after 1 version grace period

## üß™ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Before Next Deploy
1. **Test clustering with known parallel pairs:**
   ```python
   # Test case: "192 Wn.2d 453, 430 P.3d 655"
   # Expected: 1 cluster with 2 citations
   # Current: 2 clusters with 1 citation each
   ```

2. **Test verification with ambiguous citations:**
   ```python
   # Test case: "182 Wn.2d 342"
   # Expected: Match to extracted_case_name from document
   # Current: Matches to wrong case from API
   ```

3. **Regression test for FIX #43:**
   ```python
   # Test case: "183 Wn.2d 649" (with line break)
   # Expected: "Lopez Demetrio v. Sakuma Bros. Farms"
   # Must NOT regress to "Spokane County"
   ```

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test full pipeline with 1033940.pdf
- [ ] Verify data separation (extracted vs canonical)
- [ ] Check cluster counts (should be ~40-50, not 57)
- [ ] Verify all parallel citations are together

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### What Worked
1. **Systematic debugging:** Logging actual values revealed hidden bugs
2. **Test scripts:** Simple position checks found the root cause
3. **Assertions:** Catching bugs at the source prevented symptom-chasing

### What to Avoid
1. **Premature optimization:** Fixed 15 symptoms before finding root cause
2. **Assuming text matches indices:** Always verify or recalculate
3. **Normalizing without tracking:** Whitespace changes break everything

### Pro Tips
1. **Use original text for indices:** Normalization is for regex only
2. **Log everything:** Debug mode saved us multiple times
3. **Test with real PDFs:** Line breaks and formatting matter
4. **Check both code and Docker:** Caching can hide fixes
