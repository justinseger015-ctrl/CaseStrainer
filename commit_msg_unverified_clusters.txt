FEATURE: Convert SECTION 1 to display unverified clusters

USER REQUEST:
Display unverified clusters (rather than individual citations) in the 
first section of CitationResults.vue

CHANGES MADE:

1. **Section Title & Logic**:
   - Changed from "Citation Status" to "Unverified Clusters"
   - Now shows clusters that contain at least one unverified citation
   - Displays count of unverified clusters

2. **New Computed Property**:
   ```javascript
   unverifiedClusters = clusters.filter(cluster => {
     return cluster.citations.some(cit => !cit.verified && !cit.true_by_parallel)
   })
   ```

3. **Display Format**:
   Each unverified cluster shows:
   - Cluster ID and extracted case name
   - All citations in the cluster with their verification status
   - Color-coded status badges (Verified/Verified by Parallel/Unverified)

4. **Styling**:
   - Red left border (4px) for unverified clusters
   - Light red background (#fff8f8)
   - Clear visual separation between clusters
   - Header with case name and date

BENEFITS:
- Shows citations in context (grouped as parallel citations)
- User sees which clusters need attention
- Better understanding of verification status across parallel citations
- More organized than flat list of individual citations

EXAMPLE DISPLAY:
```
üîç SECTION 1: Unverified Clusters
2 cluster(s) with unverified citations

üìö Cluster cluster_29: Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe (2024)
  Citation 1: 31 Wn. App. 2d 343 - Unverified
  Citation 2: 549 P.3d 727 - Unverified

üìö Cluster cluster_30: Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe (2012)
  Citation 1: 3 Wn.2d 1031 - Unverified
```

This gives users a better view of which cases need verification, showing
all parallel citations together.
