Add cluster organization by verification status

FEATURE: Organize citation clusters to show unverified clusters first

PROBLEM:
Users need to quickly identify which citations need verification.
Previously, all clusters were shown in a flat list with no organization
by verification status.

SOLUTION:
Added _organize_clusters_by_verification() function that separates
clusters into two groups:
- unverified: Clusters where NO citations are verified (shown first)
- verified: Clusters with at least one verified citation

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
The API response now includes:
- clusters_organized: New organized structure with unverified/verified
- unverified_clusters: Quick count of unverified clusters
- verified_clusters: Quick count of verified clusters
- Original 'clusters' field preserved for backwards compatibility

BENEFITS:
1. Unverified clusters prioritized at the top
2. Easy to see verification progress at a glance
3. Reviewers can focus on what needs attention
4. Fully backwards compatible (original structure unchanged)
5. Flexible - frontend can use organized or flat structure

EXAMPLE RESPONSE:
{
  "clusters_organized": {
    "unverified": [...]  // High priority - needs verification
    "verified": [...]    // Lower priority - already verified
    "summary": {
      "unverified_count": 3,
      "verified_count": 5,
      "total": 8
    }
  }
}

DOCUMENTATION:
Created comprehensive guide (CLUSTER_ORGANIZATION_EXAMPLE.md) with:
- Response structure examples
- Frontend implementation examples
- UI design suggestions
- Use cases and benefits

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/citation_extraction_endpoint.py: Added organization function
- CLUSTER_ORGANIZATION_EXAMPLE.md: Complete documentation

STATUS: Ready to deploy. Frontend can use new structure or continue
using original flat clusters list.
