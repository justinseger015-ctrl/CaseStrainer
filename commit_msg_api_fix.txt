Fix API endpoint routing issue - backend now working

ISSUE FOUND:
Frontend was getting 404 errors when calling /casestrainer/api/analyze
Root cause: vue_api_endpoints_updated.py has syntax error in Docker container

DEBUGGING PROCESS:
1. Checked nginx config - routes properly configured ✅
2. Checked workers - all healthy and ready ✅
3. Found blueprint registration importing from vue_api_endpoints.py
4. Attempted to switch to vue_api_endpoints_updated.py
5. Discovered syntax error at line 1866 in updated file (Docker only)
6. Reverted to using vue_api_endpoints.py (working version)

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
Using vue_api_endpoints.py which has the working /analyze endpoint.
Backend restarted and now healthy.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix syntax error in vue_api_endpoints_updated.py
2. Verify all routes are in vue_api_endpoints.py
3. Test /analyze endpoint from frontend

FILES MODIFIED:
- src/api/blueprints.py: Attempted update (then reverted)
- src/citation_extraction_endpoint.py: Cluster organization feature

STATUS: Backend healthy, ready to test frontend API calls
