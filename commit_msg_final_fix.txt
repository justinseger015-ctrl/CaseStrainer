CRITICAL FIX: Remove verified status override in to_dict() that broke true_by_parallel

ROOT CAUSE FOUND: models.py to_dict() was overriding verified=False to True!

Lines 75-78 had logic:
```
if not verified_status and (canonical_name or canonical_url):
    verified_status = True  # Override!
```

This BROKE true_by_parallel because:
1. Citation gets verified=False from batch API (404 from CourtListener)
2. true_by_parallel propagates canonical_name from verified sibling  
3. to_dict() sees: verified=False BUT canonical_name exists
4. to_dict() overrides to: verified=True
5. Result: Propagation check sees "all verified" and does nothing!

THE FIX:
Removed the override logic completely. Now verified status is preserved.
- verified=False stays False even with canonical data
- This is CORRECT for true_by_parallel cases
- Canonical data can come from propagation, not direct verification

Expected Result:
- 584 U.S. 554: verified=False + canonical_name (from propagation)
- Propagation check: sees verified=False
- Sets true_by_parallel=True
- Canonical data coverage increases to 90%+

This was THE bug preventing true_by_parallel from working!
After 16 hours, we found it in the to_dict() conversion method.
