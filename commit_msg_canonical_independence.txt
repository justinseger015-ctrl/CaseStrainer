FIX: Stop propagating canonical names - keep independent per source

USER REQUIREMENT CLARIFICATION:
"We want the extracted case name in the parallel citations to be the 
same and from the document, but not the canonical case name, as parallel 
citations can be verified by different sources that have different 
canonical names"

WHAT THIS MEANS:
✅ extracted_case_name: SAME across parallel citations (from document)
❌ canonical_name: INDEPENDENT per citation (from verification source)

PROBLEM:
The code was propagating canonical_name to unverified citations in the
same cluster. This was WRONG because:
- 549 P.3d 727 verified by CourtListener P.3d API
- 31 Wn. App. 2d 343 verified by CourtListener Wn. App. API
- These may return slightly different canonical names!

Example:
- CourtListener P.3d: "Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe"
- CourtListener Wn. App.: "Flying T Ranch Inc v. Stillaguamish Tribe"
  (note: different punctuation, slightly different format)

SOLUTION:
Modified progress_manager.py canonical data section:
- ✅ KEEP: extracted_case_name propagation (lines 1203-1248)
- ❌ REMOVE: canonical_name propagation (lines 1283-1301)
- ✅ KEEP: true_by_parallel flag for unverified citations

BEFORE:
```python
if not cit_is_verified:
    cit['canonical_name'] = cluster_dict['canonical_name']  # ❌ WRONG!
    cit['canonical_date'] = cluster_dict['canonical_date']  # ❌ WRONG!
    cit['true_by_parallel'] = True
```

AFTER:
```python
if not cit_is_verified:
    cit['true_by_parallel'] = True  # ✅ Only mark as parallel
    # Do NOT copy canonical data - each source has its own
```

BEHAVIOR:
For parallel citations like 31 Wn. App. 2d 343 + 549 P.3d 727:

1. **extracted_case_name**: SAME for both
   - Both get: "Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe"
   - (Best one from document text)

2. **canonical_name**: DIFFERENT for each  
   - 31 Wn. App. 2d 343: From CourtListener Wn. App. 2d API
   - 549 P.3d 727: From CourtListener P.3d API
   - May have slight differences in formatting/punctuation

3. **true_by_parallel**: Set for unverified citations
   - Indicates "verified by association with parallel citation"
   - But keeps its own canonical data (or null if unverified)

BENEFITS:
- Respects different verification sources
- Allows for slight variations in canonical names by reporter
- More accurate representation of source data
- User can see which source verified each citation
