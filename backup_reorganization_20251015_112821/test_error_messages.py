When CourtListener experiences issues, users will now see clear,
helpful messages instead of technical errors:

SCENARIO 1: Rate Limit (429 Error)
───────────────────────────────────
Old message: "Rate limit exceeded - skipping this citation"

New message: "CourtListener is experiencing heavy usage. Please try 
again in a few minutes. (This citation will be verified via 
alternative sources.)"

✅ Benefits:
   - Explains the situation clearly
   - Tells user what to do (wait and try again)
   - Reassures them that alternative sources will be tried


SCENARIO 2: Timeout
───────────────────
Old message: "CourtListener lookup error: timeout"

New message: "CourtListener is taking longer than usual to respond. 
Please try again later. (This citation will be verified via 
alternative sources.)"

✅ Benefits:
   - Non-technical language
   - Suggests action (try later)
   - Shows fallback is happening


SCENARIO 3: Connection Error
─────────────────────────────
Old message: "CourtListener lookup error: connection refused"

New message: "Unable to connect to CourtListener. Please check your 
internet connection or try again later. (This citation will be 
verified via alternative sources.)"

✅ Benefits:
   - Clear explanation
   - Suggests troubleshooting steps
   - Mentions fallback sources


SCENARIO 4: General API Error
──────────────────────────────
Old message: "CourtListener lookup error: <technical details>"

New message: "CourtListener API error. Trying alternative sources..."

✅ Benefits:
   - Hides technical details from end users
   - Focuses on what the system is doing


WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
──────────────────
When CourtListener fails, the system automatically tries:
1. CourtListener Search API (fallback)
2. Justia Direct URL
3. OpenJurist Direct URL
4. Cornell LII Direct URL

The user sees a clear message, and verification continues with
other sources. No manual intervention needed!


IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
────────────────────────
✅ Rate limit errors (429)
✅ Timeout errors
✅ Connection errors
✅ General API errors

All return user-friendly messages that:
- Explain what happened in plain English
- Suggest what the user can do
- Reassure that the system is handling it
