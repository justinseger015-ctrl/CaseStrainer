# PDF Case Extraction Test Results

## Test File: 1028814.pdf
**Document**: Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc., No. 102881-4 (Wash. May 29, 2025)

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ EXTRACTION WORKING WELL

**Overall Statistics:**
- **Total citations found**: 124
- **Citations with case names**: 120 (96.8%)
- **Citations with years**: 122 (98.4%)
- **Unique case names**: 71
- **Success rate**: 96.8%

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Washington Reporter Pattern Fix
**Problem**: Patterns only matched Washington 2d/3d series, missing first series citations.

**Solution**: Added patterns for all Washington reporter series:
- **First Series**: `345 Wn. 678`, `123 Wash. 456`
- **Second Series**: `183 Wn.2d 649`, `183 Wash.2d 649`
- **Third Series**: `2 Wn.3d 329`
- **Court of Appeals**: `80 Wn. App. 775`, `12 Wash. App. 2d 345`

### 2. All-Caps Case Name Support
**Problem**: Patterns only matched title case, failing on all-caps court documents.

**Solution**: Added all-caps patterns:
- `[A-Z][A-Z\s&.,\'-]+` for all-caps text
- `[Vv]\.?` to handle "v.", "V.", "V ." variations
- Case-insensitive matching with `re.IGNORECASE`

### 3. Combined Extraction Strategy
**Problem**: Citation block extraction was returning early, missing standalone citations.

**Solution**: Combined both extraction methods:
- Extract citation blocks (case name + citation + year format)
- Also extract standalone citations from all patterns
- Deduplicate results to avoid duplicates

## Sample Extracted Citations

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/citation_extractor.py`**:
   - Added Washington first series patterns
   - Added all-caps case name patterns
   - Fixed regex error in State pattern
   - Combined extraction methods

2. **`src/unified_case_extraction_master.py`**:
   - Added all-caps priority patterns
   - Updated "v." to `[Vv]\.?` throughout
   - Added all-caps State and In re patterns

### Pattern Examples:

```python
# Washington First Series (NEW)
r'\b\d+\s+(?:Wash\.|Wn\.)\s+\d+\b'

# Washington Second Series
r'\b\d+\s+(?:Wash\.|Wn\.)(?:\s*2d|2d)\s+\d+\b'

# Washington Third Series
r'\b\d+\s+(?:Wash\.|Wn\.)(?:\s*3d|3d)\s+\d+\b'

# Washington Court of Appeals
r'\b\d+\s+(?:Wash\.|Wn\.)\s*App\.(?:\s*2d|2d)?\s*\d+\b'

# All-caps case names (NEW)
r'([A-Z][A-Z\'\.\&\s\-,]{2,150})\s+[Vv]\.?\s+([A-Z][A-Z\'\.\&\s\-,]{2,150})'
```

## Remaining Issues

### Minor Issues:
1. **Case caption not extracted as citation**: "Cockrum v. C.H. Murphy/Clark-Ullman, Inc." appears in the caption but isn't extracted as a formal citation (expected behavior - it's not a citation to another case).

2. **Some case names have contamination**: A few extracted names include analysis text like "We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Benjamin v. Wash. State Bar Ass" - this is being cleaned but could be improved.

## Comparison: Before vs After

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Citations Found | 1 | 124 |
| Success Rate | 100% (1/1) | 96.8% (120/124) |
| Washington Citations | 0 | 93+ |
| All-Caps Support | ❌ | ✅ |
| First Series Support | ❌ | ✅ |

## Conclusion

The case extraction system is now **working correctly** for the PDF document. The fixes successfully address:

✅ Washington reporter first series citations (Wn./Wash. without 2d/3d)  
✅ All-caps case name formatting  
✅ Multiple citation format variations  
✅ High extraction success rate (96.8%)  

The system can now handle real-world legal documents including court opinions, appellate decisions, and documents with mixed formatting conventions.
