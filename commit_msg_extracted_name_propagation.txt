FEATURE: Propagate best extracted name within clusters

User requirement: Within each cluster, use the BEST extracted case name 
for all citations, while keeping canonical names independent.

RATIONALE:
- Extracted name = Our best guess from document text (should be consistent)
- Canonical name = API-verified official name (can vary by reporter)

IMPLEMENTATION:
In progress_manager.py cluster processing:
1. Find BEST extracted name in cluster (longest, most complete)
2. Detect truncated/contaminated names:
   - Starts with "Inc. v." (lost company name)
   - Ends with citation text (boundary contamination)
3. Propagate best extracted name to ALL citations in cluster
4. Keep canonical names INDEPENDENT (don't propagate those)

EXAMPLE:
Cluster with 2 citations:
- 31 Wn. App. 2d 343: extracted = "Inc. v. Stillaguamish..." (TRUNCATED)
- 549 P.3d 727: extracted = "Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish..." (GOOD)

After propagation:
- BOTH get: extracted = "Flying T Ranch, Inc. v. Stillaguamish..."
- BUT canonical names remain independent per verification source

BENEFITS:
- Consistent extracted names within clusters
- Fixes truncation/contamination issues automatically
- Respects that different reporters may have different official names
