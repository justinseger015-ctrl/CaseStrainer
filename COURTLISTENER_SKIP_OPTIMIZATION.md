# CourtListener Skip Optimization - October 15, 2025

## 🎯 User Request

**"Can we move the courtlistener SearchAPI out of fallback verification and into the same function as citation lookup, so it skips both if we get 429 from Courtlistener?"**

## ✅ Implemented

Consolidated CourtListener APIs into a single strategy that skips the search API when rate limited.

## The Problem Before

### Old Flow (Wasteful)

```
For each citation:
├─ Strategy 1: CourtListener citation-lookup
│   └─ Gets 429 (rate limited) → returns immediately (0.5s)
├─ Strategy 2: CourtListener search API  
│   └─ Gets 429 (rate limited) → returns immediately (0.5s)
└─ Strategy 3: Fallback verification
    └─ Tries Justia, Leagle, etc. (5-10s)

Total: ~11 seconds per citation
Waste: 0.5s for search API (unnecessary when lookup is rate limited)
```

### Why This Was Wasteful

**CourtListener is ONE service:**
- If citation-lookup returns 429 → service is rate limited
- Search API will ALSO return 429 → same service!
- **No point trying search when we know it will fail**

## The Solution

### New Flow (Optimized)

```
For each citation:
├─ Strategy 1: CourtListener (unified)
│   ├─ Try citation-lookup
│   │   └─ If 429 → Skip search API entirely! ✅
│   │   └─ If not found → Try search API
│   └─ If search gets 429 → Note it
└─ Strategy 2: Fallback verification
    └─ Tries Justia, Leagle, etc. (5-10s)

Total when rate limited: ~10.5 seconds
Saved: 0.5s per citation (search API skip)
```

### Code Changes

**File:** `src/unified_verification_master.py` (lines 168-208)

**OLD (Two Separate Strategies):**
```python
# Strategy 1: CourtListener citation-lookup
result = await self._verify_with_courtlistener_lookup(...)
if is_rate_limited:
    # Continue to Strategy 2

# Strategy 2: CourtListener search API
result = await self._verify_with_courtlistener_search(...)
if is_rate_limited:
    # Continue to Strategy 3

# Strategy 3: Fallback
```

**NEW (Unified CourtListener Strategy):**
```python
# Strategy 1: CourtListener APIs (unified)
result = await self._verify_with_courtlistener_lookup(...)

if is_rate_limited:
    # SKIP search API - it will also be rate limited
    logger.warning("CourtListener rate limited - skipping search API")
    # Go straight to fallback
elif not result.verified:
    # Not rate limited, just not found - try search API
    result = await self._verify_with_courtlistener_search(...)

# Strategy 2: Fallback verification
```

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Time Savings Per Citation

| Scenario | Before | After | Saved |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Rate limited** | 11s | 10.5s | 0.5s |
| **Not found** | 11s | 11s | 0s |
| **Found in lookup** | 0.5s | 0.5s | 0s |
| **Found in search** | 1s | 1s | 0s |

### Aggregate Savings

For 132 citations (all rate limited):
- **Before:** 132 × 11s = 1,452s (24 minutes)
- **After:** 132 × 10.5s = 1,386s (23 minutes)
- **Saved:** 66 seconds (1 minute)

### Why This Matters

**When CourtListener is rate limited:**
- Every citation saves 0.5s
- Large documents with 100+ citations save 50+ seconds
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Gets to working fallback sources faster

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Rate Limit Detection

```python
is_rate_limited = result.error and "rate limit" in result.error.lower()

if is_rate_limited:
    # Skip search API - same service, same rate limit
    logger.warning("⚠️ MASTER_VERIFY: CourtListener rate limited - "
                   "skipping search API, going straight to fallback sources")
```

### Strategy Progression

**Rate Limited Path:**
```
Citation → Lookup (429) → Skip Search → Fallback Sources
          ↓ 0.5s        ↓ SKIP!        ↓ 5-10s
```

**Normal Path:**
```
Citation → Lookup (404) → Search (maybe) → Fallback Sources
          ↓ 0.5s        ↓ 0.5s         ↓ 5-10s
```

### Log Messages

**When rate limited, you'll see:**
```
🔥 [VERIFY-STRATEGY-1A] Calling CourtListener citation-lookup for '584 U.S. 554'
🔥 [VERIFY-STRATEGY-1A] Result: verified=False, error=CourtListener rate limit (429)
⚠️ MASTER_VERIFY: CourtListener rate limited - skipping search API, going straight to fallback sources
🔄 FALLBACK_VERIFY: Starting enhanced fallback for '584 U.S. 554'
```

**Notice: NO "[VERIFY-STRATEGY-1B]" (search API) log!** ✅

## 🚀 Benefits

### 1. Faster Verification When Rate Limited
- **0.5s saved per citation**
- 132 citations = 66 seconds saved
- Adds up quickly for large documents

### 2. Fewer API Calls
- Skip search API when lookup is rate limited
- Reduces load on CourtListener
- Better API citizenship

### 3. Faster Fallback Activation
- Gets to working sources (Justia, Leagle) faster
- Less waiting for inevitable 429 errors
- Better user experience

### 4. Cleaner Logs
- Less noise from redundant 429 errors
- Easier to diagnose actual issues
- Clear indication when skipping search

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario

**Input:** 132 citations, CourtListener rate limited

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Citation-lookup returns 429
2. Search API is SKIPPED (not called)
3. Goes straight to fallback sources

**Log Verification:**
```bash
# Should see ONLY 1A, not 1B:
docker logs casestrainer-rqworker1-prod | grep "VERIFY-STRATEGY-1A"  # Many
docker logs casestrainer-rqworker1-prod | grep "VERIFY-STRATEGY-1B"  # None!
```

## 🎯 Summary

**User's Request:** Skip CourtListener search API when citation-lookup is rate limited

**Implementation:** Consolidated both CourtListener APIs into Strategy 1, with conditional search API call

**Result:** 
- ✅ Saves 0.5s per citation when rate limited
- ✅ Fewer unnecessary API calls
- ✅ Faster fallback activation
- ✅ Cleaner logs

**Impact:** For 132-citation documents, saves ~1 minute of processing time when CourtListener is rate limited.

**This optimization makes the system smarter by recognizing that both CourtListener APIs share the same rate limit!** 🚀
