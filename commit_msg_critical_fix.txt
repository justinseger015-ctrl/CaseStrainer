CRITICAL FIX: Replace cluster citations with verified versions

ROOT CAUSE FINALLY FOUND:
Clusters contained OLD UNVERIFIED citations from before verification.
The verified citations (36 verified) were in citation_dicts, but clusters
still had the original unverified citations!

THE ISSUE:
1. Line 1009: extract_citations_with_clustering() returns citations + clusters
2. Clustering happens FIRST, verification happens INSIDE clustering
3. But the clusters returned have REFERENCES to the old citation objects
4. Line 1086: citation_dicts gets populated with VERIFIED citations (36 verified)
5. Line 1148: cluster_dicts copies clusters WITH OLD CITATIONS (all unverified!)
6. My canonical data extraction finds verified=False everywhere

THE FIX (progress_manager.py:1152-1186):
Before: Just converted cluster citations as-is (all unverified)
After: Look up each citation in citation_dicts and use the VERIFIED version

Implementation:
- Create citation_lookup map: citation_text -> verified citation dict
- For each citation in cluster, look it up in citation_dicts
- Replace with verified version if found
- Now clusters have citations with verified=True and canonical_name!

Expected Result:
- Clusters will now have verified citations with canonical_name
- My canonical data extraction (lines 1207-1247) will find them
- Frontend will show "Verifying Source: [Canonical Name]"

This was a data flow issue, not an API issue!
