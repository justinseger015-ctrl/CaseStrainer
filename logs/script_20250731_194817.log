=== Checking Docker Availability ===
[OK] Docker CLI is available: Docker version 28.3.2, build 578ccf6
[INFO] Docker is running in Linux containers mode
[OK] Docker Compose is available: Docker Compose version v2.38.2-desktop.1
[cslaunch] Starting interactive menu...

========================================
 Enhanced CaseStrainer Docker Launcher
                v1.3 (ENHANCED)
========================================

 1.  Quick Production Start (FASTEST)
    - Minimal checks, maximum speed

 2.  Smart Production Start (RECOMMENDED)
    - Intelligent build detection, balanced speed

 3.  Force Full Rebuild
    - Complete rebuild, use when needed

 4.   Advanced Diagnostics
 5.   Cache Management
 6.   Stop All Services
 7.  Quick Status Check
 8.  Run Production Server Test
 0.  Exit

TIP: Use option 1 for fastest startup!

Deleting all .pyc files and __pycache__ directories to prevent stale bytecode...

The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to
the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio
will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to
function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly
in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid
fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module",
"package", "session"
