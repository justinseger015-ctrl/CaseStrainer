PS>git commit -m "Enhanced URL processing to support various file formats

- Enhanced _process_url_input function to fetch and analyze URL content
- Integrated fetch_url_content from progress_manager.py for robust URL fetching
- Added support for PDF, HTML, and text content from URLs
- Fixed request_id propagation and source identification
- Updated metadata to include URL domain and content length
- Maintained all existing safeguards (URL validation, test data detection)
- URL processing now works with all file formats supported by file uploads

The system now supports URLs that point to various file formats (PDF, HTML, text)
and processes them as if they were file uploads, providing consistent citation
extraction and verification across all input types."

Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. This landmark decision overturned the separate but equal doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). The Court found that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision marked a turning point in American civil rights history and paved the way for the desegregation of public facilities across the United States. The case was argued by Thurgood Marshall, who would later become the first African American Supreme Court Justice. The unanimous decision was written by Chief Justice Earl Warren and was delivered on May 17, 1954. The implementation of the decision faced significant resistance in many parts of the country, particularly in the South, where school districts were slow to comply with the ruling. The Court would later issue a second opinion in Brown v. Board of Education II, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), which ordered that desegregation should proceed with all deliberate speed. This phrase would become controversial as many school districts used it as an excuse to delay implementation. The Brown decision had far-reaching implications beyond education, influencing other areas of civil rights law and social policy. It demonstrated the Supreme Courts role in protecting individual rights and promoting social change through constitutional interpretation. The decision also highlighted the importance of the judiciary in addressing issues of racial inequality and discrimination. Today, Brown v. Board of Education is widely regarded as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in American history, symbolizing the Courts commitment to equality and justice under the law.", "type": "text"}'
