========================================

 1.  Quick Production Start (FASTEST)
    - Minimal checks, maximum speed

 2.  Smart Production Start (RECOMMENDED)
    - Intelligent build detection, balanced speed

 3.  Force Full Rebuild
    - Complete rebuild, use when needed

 4.   Advanced Diagnostics
 5.   Cache Management
 6.   Stop All Services
 7.  Quick Status Check
 8.  Run Production Server Test
 0.  Exit

TIP: Use option 1 for fastest startup!
