# Citation Verification Logic Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The citation verification system was marking citations as "verified" even when there was insufficient evidence to support verification. Specifically:

1. **Overly permissive verification**: Citations were marked as verified if the citation text appeared anywhere in search result pages, even without legal context
2. **Poor case name matching**: Citations were verified with generic case names like "Found in State Courts" instead of actual case names
3. **Weak verification criteria**: Single source verification was accepted without requiring multiple sources or proper case name validation

## Examples of Problematic Verifications

From the user's example:
- Citation "181 Wash.2d 391" was marked as verified by "State Courts" with case name "Found in State Courts"
- Citation "334 P.3d 519" was marked as verified by "CourtListener" with case name "Unknown Case"
- Both citations had the extracted case name "s prior decision in Walston v. Boeing Co" but this wasn't being used for validation

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Stricter Verification Logic

**File**: `src/enhanced_multi_source_verifier.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `_verify_citation_with_context()` helper method that requires legal context around citations
- Updated all verification methods (`_try_state_courts`, `_try_google_scholar`, `_try_justia`, `_try_leagle`, `_try_findlaw`, `_try_casetext`) to use stricter verification
- Added legal context indicators: 'case', 'opinion', 'decision', 'court', 'judge', 'judgment', 'ruling', 'appeal', 'petition', 'motion', 'brief', 'argument', 'plaintiff', 'defendant', 'respondent', 'appellant', 'litigation', 'lawsuit', 'legal', 'jurisdiction', 'precedent', 'holding'

### 2. Improved Case Name Validation

**Changes**:
- Enhanced case name extraction patterns to better identify actual case names
- Added filtering to exclude generic case names like "Found in [Source]"
- Improved case name similarity checking in the main verification logic

### 3. More Strict Verification Criteria

**Changes in `_verify_with_api()`**:
- **CourtListener verification**: Always accepted (highest confidence)
- **Multiple sources**: Require at least 2 sources for verification
- **Single source with case name**: Only accept if source provides a real case name (not "Found in [Source]")
- **Verification reason**: Added detailed explanation of why verification succeeded or failed

### 4. Better Error Handling and Logging

**Changes**:
- Added `verification_reason` field to explain verification decisions
- Added `courtlistener_verified` flag to track CourtListener verification separately
- Improved error messages to distinguish between "not found" and "found but insufficient evidence"

## New Verification Criteria

A citation is now marked as verified only if:

1. **CourtListener verification**: Citation is found in CourtListener API (highest confidence)
2. **Multiple sources**: Citation is verified by at least 2 different sources
3. **Single source with case name**: Citation is verified by one source AND that source provides a real case name (not generic "Found in [Source]")

## Testing

**File**: `test_verification_fix.py`

Created a test script to verify the new logic works correctly with the problematic citations from the user's example.

## Expected Results

With the new logic:
- Citations like "181 Wash.2d 391" and "334 P.3d 519" should no longer be marked as verified unless they meet the stricter criteria
- Citations will only be verified if there's actual evidence of a real case, not just citation text appearing in search results
- Better case name matching will improve the quality of verified citations
- More detailed verification reasons will help users understand why citations are or aren't verified

## Cache Clearing

Added `clear_cache()` method to force fresh verification and ensure the new logic takes effect immediately.
