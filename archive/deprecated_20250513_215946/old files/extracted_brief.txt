Summary of argument  ................................ ................................ . 9 
Argument:  
Petitioner’s attempted murder offense is a crime of 
violence under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)  ................................ ....... 13 
A. Intentionally causing bodily injury or death 
requires the attempted use of physical force against 
the person of another  ................................ ......................  14 
1. Intentionally causing death requires “physical 
force”  ................................ ................................ ..........  14 
2. Intentionally causing death requires the “use” 
of physical force “against the person or 
property of another”  ................................ .................  17 
a. The deliberate employment of deadly force 
to kill a victim is the “use” of force “against 
the person or property of another”  ..................  18 
b.  The law of murder and other crimes has 
traditionally viewed “omissions” as “acts”  ...... 23 
B. Excluding “omissions” would defeat the design of 
Section 924(c)(3)( A) and similar elements clauses by 
cutting out paradigmatically violent crimes  .................  29 
C. Petitioner’s reading of Section 924(c) is textually 
and practically unsound  ................................ ..................  33 
1. Physical force does not require external 
physical contact  ................................ .........................  33 
2. Petitioner’s narrow interpretation of “use * * * 
against the person or property of another” is 
insupportable  ................................ .............................  36 
3. Petitioner’s view of Section 924(c)’s structure, 
purpose, and history is incorrect and self -
contradictory  ................................ .............................  40

STATEMENT  
Following a jury trial in the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York, petitioner 
was convicted on one count of conspiring to commit rack-
eteering  under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations (RICO)  Act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
1962(d);  one count of operating an illegal gambling busi-
ness, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1955  and 2 ; one count of con-
spiring to commit murder for hire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
1958; one count of conspiring to commit murder, in viola-
tion of the Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering (VICAR)  
statute, 18 U.S.C. 1959(a)( 5); one count of VICAR at-
tempted murder , in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1959(a)(5);  and 
one count of using or carrying a firearm during and in 
relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
924(c)(1)(A)(i)  and 2 .  Judgment 1 -2.  The court sen-
tenced him to 300 months of imprisonment , to be fol-
lowed by three  years of supervised release .  Judgment 
3-4.  The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-15a, 
16a-33a.   
1. Petitioner was an associate in the Genovese Crime 
Family, part of “the larger criminal network known as 
‘La Cosa Nostra ’ in New York. ”  Pet. App. 5a.  Petitioner  
worked for Robert DeBello , a “ made ” member of the 
Family , and “participat ed in a variety of criminal activ-
ities, ” including helping to run an illegal sports -gambling 
operation in Queens .  Ibid .; Presentence Investigation 
Repor t (PSR) ¶ 17.   

4 
 In 2014, a local “bully, ” Joseph Bonelli, began  caus-
ing problems for the owner of a  gas station  that peti-
tioner and the Family frequented.  Pet. App.  6a; see id. 
at 5a-6a.  The Family also suspected Bonelli of “cooper-
ating against ‘known bookies in the neighborhood, ’ which 
made him a potential threat ” to the Family ’s gambling 
business.  Id. at 6a (citation omitted) ; see PSR ¶  24.  The 
gas-station  owner paid petitioner to “organize[] a plot to 
murder Bonelli .”  Pet. App. 6a.  P etitioner shared the 
payment with DeBello , received permission to kill 
Bonelli , and then paid an accomplice $5000 “to coordinate 
the murder  with several members of the ‘Crips ’ gang. ”  
Ibid.  
Once  a “murder crew” was assembled, petitioner 
gave the  crew  a brown paper bag containing a .38 re-
volver , provided the  crew  with a car, and sent the  crew  
to murder Bonelli.  Pet. App. 6a; PSR ¶ ¶ 26, 27.  The 
crew drove to Bonelli ’s home and waited in a parking lot 
around the corner  in order  to ambush Bonelli when he 
returned .  Pet. App. 6a ; PSR ¶ 26 .  When Bonelli arrived 
home with another person , however, the potential for 
witnesses led the crew to abort the murder plan .  Pet. 
App. 6a.  Upon learning that the crew had not killed 
Bonelli, petitioner tried to get the  crew  “to return at 
once ” and kill both Bonelli and his companion.  Ibid.   
The crew refused , but agreed to return the next day.  
Id. at 6a -7a.   
The next day, the crew reassembled and again drove 
to Bonelli ’s home.  Pet. App. 7a.  The  crew  brought the 
gun that petitioner had provided  the day before, a 
change of clothes, and a spray bottle “believed to con-
tain a bleach solution. ”  PSR ¶  27.  While en route, the 
driver coordinated with petitioner.  Ibid .  But l aw- 
enforcement officers had learned of the plot , and they 

5 
 intercepted and arrested the crew  near Bonelli’s home .  
Pet. App. 7a ; PSR ¶ 27 .   
Shortly after the crew ’s arrest, petitioner “met with 
several of his co -conspirators and others in the Family to 
discuss the botched murder attempt.”  Pet. App. 7a.  And 
when the accomplice petitioner had paid to coordinate  the 
murder was released on bail, p etitioner met with him and 
told him that they should stay in contact so that “maybe 
[they] could plan to get rid of [Bonelli] for good.”  Ibid.  
(quoting C.A. App. 154)  (brackets in original) .   
2. A grand jury in the Southern District of New York 
charged petitioner  with one count of conspiring to  com-
mit racketeering under the RICO  Act, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. 1962(d); one count of operating an illegal gam-
bling business, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1955  and 2 ; one 
count of conspiring to commit murder for hire, in viola-
tion of 18 U.S.C. 1958; one count of conspiring to commit 
murder, in violation of the VICAR  statute, 18 U.S.C. 
1959(a)( 5); one count of VICAR attempted murder, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. 1959(a)(5); and one count of using 
or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime 
of violence , in violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A)(i).   Sec-
ond Superseding Indictment 2-20.   
a. Section 924(c) , the relevant form of which was en-
acted i n 1986 , specifies a mandatory consecutive sen-
tence for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation 
to a “crime of violence,” or possessing a firearm in further-
ance of  a “crime of violence.”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A) ; see 
Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 99 -308, 
§ 104(a)(2)(F), 100 Stat. 457 .  Section 924(c)(3) defines a 
crime of violence  in two ways.  First, the “elements  
clause ” encompasses  any federal felony that “has as an 
element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of 
physical force against the person or property of an-

6 
 other. ”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A).  Second, the “residual 
clause ” includes any federal  felony that “by its nature, 
involves a substantial risk that physical force against 
the person or property of another may be used in the 
course of committing the offense. ”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(B).   
In United States v. Davis , 588 U.S. 445  (2019 ), this 
Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally 
vague .  Id. at 470.   
This Court employs a “categorical approach” to de-
termine whether an offense is a crime of violence under 
Section 924(c)(3)(A) .  United States v. Taylor , 596 U. S. 
845, 850  (2022) .  Under that approach, a court “focus[es] 
solely” on “the elements of the crime of conviction,” not 
“the particular facts of the case.”   Mathis v. United 
States , 579 U.S. 500, 504 (2016).  The categorical ap-
proach assesses  whether the  “least culpable” conduct 
that could satisfy the  offense elements  in a hypothetical 
case would  “necessarily involve[  ]” the “‘use, attempted 
use, or threatened use of physical force against the per-
son or property of another .’”  Borden  v. United States , 
593 U.S. 420, 424  (2021) (plurality opinion)  (quoting 18 
U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A) ).   
b. Although the underlying crime of violence for a 
Section 924(c) offense need not itself be charged as a sep-
arate count,  see United States  v. Rodriguez -Moreno , 526 
U.S. 275, 280 (1999),  the Section 924(c)  charge in peti-
tioner’s indictment listed several of the other charges 
as potential predicates .  See Second Superseding In-
dictment 19 -20.  One of those predicates was the charge 
of attempted  murder under the VICAR  statute, 
18 U.S.C. 1959(a)(5) .  See Second Superseding Indict-
ment 20. 
Section 1959(a)(5) prohibits , inter alia , “attempting  
* * *  to commit murder ” of any person, “in violation of 

7 
 the laws of any State or the United States,”  “for the pur-
pose of   * * *  maintaining or increasing position in an 
enterprise engaged in racketeering activity. ”  18 U.S.C. 
1959(a) (5).  Because the VICAR statute requires an un-
derlying state or federal crime that constitutes  at-
tempted “murder,” proving a VICAR violation  requires 
showing that a defendant’s conduct both qualifies as a 
violation of a state or federal attempted -murder statute 
and satisfies a generic federal definition of attempted 
“murder.”  See United States  v. Keene , 955 F.3d 391, 
398-399 (4th Cir. 2020) .  As a practical matter, i f the rel-
evant state or federal murder prohibition is substan-
tially similar to or narrower than the generic definition, 
the jury may be instructed only as to the specific state 
or federal offense.  
The charge of attempted murder underlying peti-
tioner’s Section 924(c) count was premised on petitioner’s 
commission of  New York attempted second -degree mur-
der, in violation of New York Penal Law  § 20.00 (McK in-
ney 2009); id. § 110.00 (McKinney 20 09); id. § 125.25(1)  
(McKinney 20 09).  Second Superseding Indictment 16 -
17.  The applicable  New York  definition of second - 
degree murder covers conduct in which a defendant has 
“intent to cause the death of another person [and] 
causes the death of such person or of a third person. ”  
N.Y. Penal L aw § 125.25(1)  (McKinney 20 09).  Attempt 
under New York law, in turn, requires specific intent to 
commit the underlying crime and “conduct which tends 
to effect the commission of such  crime. ”  Id. § 110.00  
(McKinney 20 09); see  id. § 20.00 (McKinney 2009) (aid-
ing and abetting liability).    
c. Before trial, p etitioner moved to dismiss the Sec-
tion 924(c) count , arguing  that Section 924(c) ’s residual 
clause was unconstitutionally vague  and that none of the 

8 
 charged predicates qualified as a crime of violence.   
D. Ct. Doc. 450 , at 14-20 (Nov. 22, 2017).  The district 
court denied the motion.  Pet. App. 40a-41a.   
The jury found petitioner guilty on all counts , with a 
special verdict form specifying that the verdict on the 
Section 924(c) charge was supported by  each of the  four 
charged predicates (the three conspiracies and the 
VICAR attempted murder).  D. Ct. Doc. 568 (Mar. 29, 
2018) .  The court sentenced petitioner  to 300 months  of 
imprisonment , consisting of a term of 240 month s on the 
non-Section 924(c) counts and a consecutive 60 -month 
sentence for the Section 924(c) offense , to be followed 
by three years of supervised release .  Judgment 3-4. 
3. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a -15a.1   
In light of Davis , which was  decided while petitioner’s 
appeal was pending, the government acknowledged that 
the only viable predicate for the Section 924(c) charge 
was VICAR attempted murder.  Oral Argument at 14:36 -
15:10  (2d Cir.  Nov. 18, 2019); see Pet. App. 10a.  
On appeal, p etitioner assert ed that VICAR at-
tempted murder based on New York second -degree 
murder did not satisfy Section 924(c)’s elements clause  
because it can, in theory, be committed by “omission .”  
Pet. C.A. Br. 48 -49.  Under New York law, criminal lia-
bility as a general matter can be premised either on “a 
 
1  On June 8, 2022, th e court of appeals issued both a published opin-
ion rejecting petitioner’s challenge to his Section 924(c) c onviction , 36 
F.4th 423, and a summary order disposing of petitioner’s and his co -
defendant’s other claims, Pet. App. 1 6a-33a.  A few weeks later, when 
this Court decided United States  v. Taylor , which held that at-
tempted Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under Section 
924(c)(3)(A),  see 596 U.S. at 860,  petitioner successfully moved for 
panel rehearing , Pet. App.  4a.  The court of appeals withdrew the 
earlier published opinion and issued an amended opinion that ad-
dress ed petitioner’s arguments “in light of Taylor .”  Id. at 5a.

 voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which 
[the defendant] is physically capable of performing,” 
N.Y. Penal Law § 15.10  (McKinney 2009) , with the term 
“omission” defined as the “failure to perform an act as 
to which a duty of performance is imposed by law ,” id. 
§ 15.00(3)  (McKinney 2009) .   
The court of appeals rejected petitioner’s  argument.  
See Pet. App. 10a -15a.  The court found  “no question 
that intentionally causing the death of another person 
involves the use of force. ”  Id. at 11a-12a (citing United 
States  v. Castleman , 572 U.S. 157, 169 (2014)).  The 
court further explained that , as applicable here,  New 
York ’s attempt law  “ ‘categorically requires that a per-
son take a substantial step toward the use of physical 
force, ’ ” and thus “there can be no doubt that attempt to 
commit second -degree murder under New York law is 
itself categorically a crime of violence ,” id. at 12a-13a 
(citation omitted) .  And, r elying on the recent en banc 
opinion in United States v. Scott , 990 F.3d 94  (2d Cir.) , 
cert. denied , 142 S. Ct. 397 (2021), the court emphasized 
that “whether a defendant acts by commission or omis-
sion, in every instance, it is his intentional use of physical  
force against the person of another that causes death. ”  
Pet. App. 14a (quoting Scott , 990 F.3d at 123).   
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  
Petitioner’s attempted murder offense —which is 
equivalent for present purposes to a completed murder 
offense —is a “crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. 
924(c)(3).  Murder is a paradigmatically violent crime 
that has “as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against the person or 
property of another .”  18 U.S.C. 924(c) (3)(A).  Intention-
ally causing someone’s body to cease functioning, whether 
by the “affirmative act” of  shooting a gun or the “omis-

10 
 sion” of torturously starving a child, inherently involves 
making physical force the instrument of the victim’s 
death.   Text, precedent, context, and history all show 
that homicide and bodily -injury crimes lie at the  core of 
the elements clause.  Excluding such crimes  would hol-
low out not only Section 924(c) (3), but elements clauses 
in other statutes, such as the prohibition against fire-
arm possession by domestic abusers.   
A.  Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s text squarely  encompasses 
offenses involving the intentional causation of bodily in-
jury or death.  As a threshold matter , such offenses nec-
essarily involve “physical force,” which this Court has 
defined as “force exerted by and through concrete bod-
ies” that is “capable of causing physical pain or injury 
to another person.”  Johnson  v. United States , 559 U.S. 
133, 138, 140 (2010).  Indeed, in a related context, this 
Court has expressly rejected the proposition that “one 
can cause b odily injury without the use of physical 
force.”  United States  v. Castleman , 572 U.S. 157, 170 
(2014)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) .  
Poisoning, for example, involves  “physical force ” be-
cause it involves “forceful physical properties”  inside 
someone’s body.  Id. at 171  (citation s omitted) .  A “dis-
ease,” id. at 170  (citation omitted) , or the starvation of 
a child , operate similarly.   
Offenses involving the intentional causation of injury 
or death also necessarily involve the “use” of that force  
as the instrument of injury or death  “against” the vic-
tim.  The ordinary meaning of “use” includes “avail [ing]  
oneself of,” or “carry [ing]  out a purpose or action by 
means of.”  Smith  v. United States , 508 U.S. 223, 229 
(1993 ) (citation s omitted) .  And the “against” clause 
simply requires that the victim be “the conscious object 
(not the mere recipient) of the force .”  Borden  v. United 

11 
 States , 593 U.S. 420, 43 0 (2021) (plurality opinion); id. 
at 446 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).  Inten-
tional murder meets those requirements regardless of 
how it is accomplished.   
A murderer “carr ies out his purpose” to kill his victim 
through a physical process whether he stabs the victim 
with a knife  or withhold s lifesaving medication that he is 
required to administer.  As the Court has recognized, a 
poisoner uses force  “not [by] the act of ‘sprinkl[ing]’  the 
poison ,” but by “ the act of employing poison knowingly 
as a device to cause physical harm .”  Castleman , 572 
U.S. at 171 (second set of brackets in original) .  The 
proper focus is thus on the physical harm that  the de-
fendant intentionally causes, not any “affirmative act ” 
he may take.   A defendant “employs” poison whether he 
places it in the cup or withholds an antidote that the law 
would require him to provide.    
Common parlance , in which one can “use” preexist-
ing forces like river currents, recognizes the equiva-
lence.  So do es legal tradition, which has for centuries 
treated  “affirmative acts” and “omissions”  of required 
conduct  as equivalent.  As commentators recognized, a  
distinction between the two simply invites  a meaning-
less word game:  did the parent “omit” to provide food, 
or affirmatively “withhold” it?  By the time Congress 
enacted Section 924(c) (3), most  States had rejected such  
a distinction, and nothing  in the elements clause indi-
cates  that Congress was adopting one.    
B. Engrafting such a distinction onto  the elements 
clause would not only be atextual, but also ahistorical —
with calamitous consequences that Congress could not 
have intended .  The history of Section 924(c)(3) and  el-
ements clauses in  other statutes confirms that Congress 
included  offenses like murder .  Had Congress  only in-

12 
 cluded “affirmative act”  crim es, it would have risked ex-
cluding murder offenses in nearly every jurisdiction, 
along with numerous state assault and robbery offenses  
and a variety of federal offenses .  In addition, p eti-
tioner’s position here would , among other things, undo 
the Court’s efforts to preserve numerous  offenses as 
“crime [s] of domestic violence” under 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9).   
C. Petitioner  provides no sound support for that po-
sition .  His assertions  that physical force must be exter-
nal, and that “using” force requires taking an affirma-
tive step , have no basis in the statut ory text  and cannot 
be squared with  this Court’s precedent .  Nor does any-
thing about the context, history, or purpose of Section 
924(c) —an offense  directed at using firearms in violent 
crimes —suggest an elements clause that would treat 
murder  and similar crimes  as non -forcible offense s 
based on a handful of “omission” scenarios that would 
not involve a firearm.  And contrary to petitioner’s  claim,  
the elements clause —not the residual clause —is the 
natural home for a quintessentially violent crime  like 
murder, which involves actual harm, not just the “risk” 
of it.    
D. The traditional tools of statutory construction  
leave no “grievous ambiguity ,” Castleman , 572 U.S. at 
173 (citation omitted) , that would allow for application 
of the rule of lenity .  To the contrary, t he Court’s prec-
edents make particularly clear  that a defendant neces-
sarily uses physical force in committing a crime involv-
ing the intentional causation of physical injury —like the 
shooting that petitioner tried to arrange .   

13 
 ARGUMENT  
PETITIONER’S ATTEMPTED MURDER OFFENSE IS A 
CRIME OF VIOLENCE UNDER 18 U.S.C.  924(C)(3)  
At least for purposes of the question presented here, 
petitioner does not dispute  that attempted  murder is a 
crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3) so long as 
murder is .  See  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A) (covering both 
“use” and “attempted use” of force) ; see, e.g., Pet. Br. 
18 (referring to “predicate offense of second -degree 
murder ”).  And m urder  is a quintessential crime of vio-
lence  under Section 924(c)(3)(A).  When a defendant in-
tentionally causes the physical demise of another per-
son, he has “us e[d]  * * *  physical force against the per-
son  * * *  of another.”   18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A).  Accord-
ingly, b ecause New York second -degree murder re-
quires intentionally caus ing the death of another, peti-
tioner committed  a crime of violence  under Section 
924(c) .   
The text, context, and history of Section 924(c) make 
clear that a crime like murder is a crime of violence irre-
spective  of whether it can be committed by withholding 
required cond uct, as when a parent torturously starves  
a child.  As this Court’s precedents show, deadly force  
involved in murder  (i) may be purely internal (as with 
poison or a disease) , see United States v. Castleman , 
572 U.S. 157 , 170 (2014) ; (ii) necessarily  qualifies as 
“force capable of causing physical pain or injury to an-
other person”  when it actually causes death , Johnson v. 
United States , 559 U.S. 133, 1 40 (2010) ; and (iii) is “em-
ploy[ed] ” by the defendant  “as a device to cause physi-
cal harm ” when it functions as the murder weapon,  Cas-
tleman , 572 U.S. at 171.  Contrary to petitioner’s argu-
ment , Section 924(c) does not require an “affirmative ” 
act or impose other conditions that would eliminate  not 

14 
 only murder  crimes , but also many assault and robbery 
offenses, as “crime[s] of violence,” 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3), 
“violent felon [ies],” 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2) (B), and “crime[s] 
of domestic violence ,” 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9),  under stat-
utes specifically designed to cover those offenses .  
A. Intentional ly Cau sing  Bodily Injury Or Death Requires 
The Attempt ed Use Of Physical Force  Against The Per-
son Of Another  
The language of the elements clause readily encom-
passes offenses in which a defendant intentionally 
cause s, or attempt s to cause , bodily injury or death to 
another, regardless of how the injury manifests.  Whether 
the injury arises from intentionally firing a bullet or in-
tentionally starving a child , the crime involves the “use ” 
or “attempted use  * * * of physical force against the 
person *  * * of another .”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3).  The po-
tential for crime s to be committed by withholding re-
quired conduct —a feature of  many canonically violent 
crimes like murder —is no basis for excluding those of-
fenses from the elements clause.   
1. Intentionally causing death requires “physical force ” 
The term “  ‘physical force’  *  * *  refers to force ex-
erted by and through concrete bodies —distinguishing 
physical force from, for example, intellectual force or 
emotional force.”  Johnson , 559 U.S. at 138 (citation 
omitted) .  And when used in the context of a statutory 
definition of a crime of violence, “the phrase ‘physical 
force’ means violent force —that is, force capable of 
causing physical pain or injury to another person.”  Id. 
at 140.  As this Court’s precedent illustrates,  caus ing a 
person’s body to cease functioning satisfies both re-
quirements.  

15 
 a. In United States v. Castleman , the Court ad-
dressed the scope of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence” for purposes of  18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9)’s prohibi-
tion against firearm possession by domestic abusers .  
That term is defined, in part, through an elements 
clause, which requires that the crime “has, as an ele-
ment, the use or attempted use of physical force.”   18 
U.S.C. 921(a)(33)(A) (ii) (2012) .  In holding that the def-
inition  encom passes the crime of “intentionally or know-
ingly caus[ing]  bodily injury” t o a domestic partner , the 
Court recognized that “a ‘bodily injury’  must  result 
from ‘physical force. ’ ”  Castleman , 572 U.S. at 169-170 
(emphasis added; citation omitted) .  The same logic ap-
plies here . 
As Castleman explain ed, the relevant “physical 
force” is not the act of the defendant, but the basis for 
the injury.  “That the harm occurs indirectly, rather 
than directly (as with a kick or punch) , does not matter.”   
Castleman , 572 U.S. at 171.  The Court squarely re-
jected the proposition that “one can cause bodily injury 
without the use of physical force —for example, by de-
ceiving [the victim]  into drinking a poisoned beverage, 
without making contact of any kind.”  Id. at 170 (citation 
and internal quotat ion marks omitted; brackets in orig-
inal) .  Although the perpetrator  may use only intellec-
tual “force ” to trick the victim in to drink ing the bever-
age, the offense nonetheless categorically involves the 
“physical force”  of the poison “caus [ing]  physical harm”  
to the victim’s body.   Id. at 171.   The “physical force”  in 
that scenario is the poison’s “forceful physical proper-
ties as a matter of organic chemistry.”  Ibid.  (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted).  
What is true for poison is likewise true for other 
sources of harm,  like starvation or disease .  Whether by 

16 
 poison, starvation, or lack of medicine, what causes 
harm or death is the physical impediment of a bodily 
process  through the presence of a substance harmful  to 
the body’s physical functioning (e.g., poison  or disease ) 
or the absence of a substance necessary to the body’s 
physical survival (e.g., food or medication ).  Poisoning in-
volves “a toxic level” of a chemical that “accumulate[s] in 
the cells of the target or tissue,” which “injur[es]” the cells 
and “disrupts their normal structure or function .”  Bruce 
W. Halstead & Curti s D. Klaassen , Poison , Encyclopedia 
Britannica  (Sept.  4, 2024) , https://www. britannica.com/
science/ poison -biochemistry .  Similarly, s tarvation involves 
the “body break [ing]  down its own muscles and other tis-
sues .”  Roopam Bassi & Saurabh Sharma, Starvation —By 
“Ill” or by “Will ,” 2 Current Trends in Diagnosis & Treat-
ment 32 (2018), https://www.ctdt.co.in/ doi/pdf/10.5005/
jp-journals -10055 -0034  (Starvation ); see id. at 34 -35.  
And bodily disease is a “condition  of the body, or of 
some part or organ of the body, in which its functions 
are disturbed or deranged.”  3 The Oxford English Dic-
tionary  441 (1978)  (OED).   
b. Because Castleman involved “physical force” in 
the context of a misdemeanor,  its reasoning looked to  
the meaning of  “applying force in the common -law 
sense .”  572 U.S. at 170 .  The Court  did not address the 
further requirement, applicable to felony -level force, 
that it be “violent force —that is, force capable of caus-
ing physical pain or injury to another person ,” Johnson , 
559 U.S. at 140 ; see Castleman , 572 U.S. at 163 -166.  But 
as Justice Scalia’s concurrence in Castleman recog-
nized,  force that causes bodily harm —or death —satisfies  
that requirement as well.   See 572 U.S. at 174.   
As Justice Scalia explained, it “is impossible to cause 
bodily injury without using force ‘capable of  ’ producing 

17 
 that result.”  Castleman , 572 U.S.  at 174 (Scalia, J., con-
curring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Force 
that causes bodily injury is therefore “violent force ,” 
Johnson , 559 U.S. at 140 (emphasis omitted) —which is, 
“after all,  * * *  simply physical force distinguished by 
the degree of harm sought to be caused.”   United States 
v. Báez -Martínez , 950 F.3d 1 19, 132 (1st Cir. 2020) , cert. 
denied, 141 S. Ct. 2805 (2021) .   
The distinction in the potential harmfulness of the 
force  does not suggest a difference in what the relevant 
force is.  The focus  of the inquiry  remains the same as 
in Castleman :  on the “ ‘forceful physical properties ’ ” of 
poison, not the gentle “sprinkling” of it; the “bullet   * * *  
that actually  strikes the victim,” not the “pulling [of] the 
trigge r”; or the car crash, not the  “ ‘intangible ’  * * *  la-
ser beam” that blinds the driver .  572 U.S. at 17 0-171 
(brackets and citations omitted).    
Nothing suggests that such injurious or deadly  
harm s would involve “physical force” for misdemeanor 
purposes, but  not felony purposes.  Were it otherwise, 
murder would be disqualified as a crime of violence 
simply because it can be committed by poisoning (or 
pulling a trigger) —a result that even petitioner disa-
vows.  Br. 7, 13, 31 -32. 
2. Intentionally causing death requires the “use” of 
physical force  “against the person or property of an-
other ” 
Ordinary meaning , precedent, and the relevant  legal 
backdrop likewise show that i ntentionally causing 
someone’s death satisfies Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s require-
ment that the force be “use[d]  *  * *  against the person 
or property of another .”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A).   Whether 
through “act” or “omission,” the harm -causing force is  
the means through which the defendant kills his victim.   

18 
 a. The deliberate employment of deadly force to kill a 
victim is the “use” of force “against the person or 
property of another”  
i. As this Court observed  in Smith  v. United States , 
508 U.S. 223 (1993) , the “ordinary,” “natural,” “every-
day meaning” of the word “use” requires only that a 
person “  ‘make use of  ’ ” something , “ ‘convert [ it] to one’s 
service, ’ ” “ ‘employ [it], ’ ” “ ‘avail oneself of [it], ’ ” “ ‘carry 
out a purpose or action by means of  [it],’ ” or “ ‘derive 
service from [it] .’ ”  Id. at 22 8-229 (citations omitted) .  
Dictionaries at the time that Section 924(c)(3)(A) was 
enacted include similarly expansive definitions.  See, 
e.g., 11 OED  471 (“[t]o make use of (some immaterial 
thing) as a means or instrument; to employ for a certain 
end or purpose ”; “[t]o employ or make use of (an article, 
etc.,) esp. for a profitable end or purpose; to utilize, turn 
to account”) ; Black’s Law Dictionary 1381 -1382 (5th ed. 
1979) (“[t]o make use of, to convert to one’s service, to 
avail one’s self of, to employ”; “to employ for or apply to 
a given purpose”; “to carry out a purpose or action by 
means of  ”).2  Accordingly, in Smith , the Court inter-
preted  “use” in another (then -current) provision  of Sec-
tion 924(c) as “sweep[ing] broadly ” and cautioned 
against limiting the term to “the example of ‘use’ that 
most immediately comes to mind” when doing so would 
 
2  See also, e.g., Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of 
the English Language 2523 -2524 (1986) (“to put into action or ser-
vice: have recourse to or enjoyment of  ”; “to carry out a purpose or 
action by means of : make instrumental to an end or process : apply 
to advantage”);  Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary  1299  
(1985) (“to put into action or service : avail oneself of : employ”; “to 
carry out a purpose or action by means of  ”) (capitalization omitted) ; 
The Random House College Dictionary  1448  (rev. ed. 1980) (“to em-
ploy for some purpose; put into service; make use of  ”; “to avail one-
self of; apply to one’s own purposes”).  

19 
 “exclude[] any other use” that is consistent with “dic-
tionary definitions and experience.”  508 U.S. at 229 -230 
(emphasis omitted).     
This Court’s subsequent decisions  illustrate  that a 
similarly broad definition applies here .  In interpreting  
the term “use” in the  definition  of a misdemeanor crime 
of domestic violence, the Court  in Voisine  v. United 
States , 579 U.S. 68 6 (2016) , looked to verb forms of th e 
word and embraced prior decisions —including Smith —
explaining that it means “ ‘to convert  to one’s service, ’ 
‘to employ ’ or ‘to avail oneself of ,’ ” and “to employ or to 
derive service from.”  Id. at 692 n.3 (2016)  (brackets and 
citations omitted) (quoting Bailey  v. United States , 516 
U.S. 137, 145 (1995); Smith , 508 U.S. at 229 ; Astor  v. 
Merritt , 111 U.S. 202, 213 (1884) ).   
And as the plurality in Borden v. United States , 593 
U.S. 420 (2021), recognized, the meaning  of “use”  in the 
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence provision at is-
sue in Voisine is no different  from the meaning of “use”  
in an elements clause like Section 924(c)(3)(A) ’s.  Con-
struing the nearly identical elements clause in the 
Armed Career Criminal Act  of 1984  (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. 
924(e)(2)(B)(i) , the Borden plurality made clear that 
“the word ‘use’  * * *  is indeed  the same” there as it was 
in Voisine .  593 U.S.  at 442 ; see  Castleman , 572 U.S. at 
170-171 (relying on Leocal  v. Ashcroft , 543 U.S. 1 (2004), 
in interpreting  the word “use” in the definition of a mis-
demeanor crime of domestic violence).  
The “textual difference ,” Borden , 593 U.S. at 442 
(plurality opinion),  between an elements clause like the 
ACCA’s or Section 924(c)(3)(A) ’s and the one in Voisine 
is that Section 924(c)(3)(A) ’s requires the “use” (or at-
tempted or threatened use) of force “against the person 
or property of another ,” 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A).   But th e 

20 
 additional phrase simply requires that the victim be 
“the conscious object (not the mere recipient) of the 
force ,” necessitating a mens rea greater than reckless-
ness .  Borden , 593 U.S. at 430 (plurality opinion) ; see id. 
at 433 (plurality opinion) (suggesting that the additional 
language would otherwise be “surplusage”); id. at 446 
(Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) .  That phrase 
does not alter the broad meaning of “use,” see id. at 442 
(plurality opinion), let alone suggest that intentional 
murder is not a “crime of violence” under Section 
924(c)(3) when physical force is deliberately employed 
to kill a victim.  
ii. The statutory text therefore plainly encompasses 
intentional murder .  And it does so irrespective of whether  
the criminal’s  conduct can be characterized as an “omis-
sion.”  A defendant who intends to cause death by with-
hold ing a duty owed to another can “ employ,” “utilize,” 
“avail himself of,” or “carry out [his] purpos e” by means 
of existing physical force  even if he does not  directly  in-
itiate that force .   
For example, a  lifeguard who sees his enemy drown-
ing in the water can make use of the force of the water 
and the lack of oxygen in the victim’s lungs to end that 
enemy’s life.   A parent who starves his child to death 
avails himself of the  physical processes of the  child’s 
body to fulfill his own purposes.  See Starvation 34-35.  
And a  caretaker intent on ridding himself of a patient 
can carry out that intent  by withholding life -saving 
medicine, thereby using an existing disease to cause the 
patient’s death.  See 3 OED 441.  In each case, the per-
petrator “causes death by breaching a legal duty to 
check or redress violent force because  he intends 
thereby for that force to cause serious physical injury ” 
to his victim.  United States v. Scott , 990 F.3d 94, 101 

21 
 (2d Cir.) (en banc) , cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 397 (2021) .  
In doing so, he “ is making that force his own injurious 
instrument”  against his target.   Ibid.  
The poisoning example from Castleman is directly 
on point.  The Court recognized  that “the word ‘use’ con-
veys the idea that the thing used (here, ‘physical force’) 
has been made the user’s instrument .”  572 U.S. at 170 -
171 (citation omitted) .  And the Court explained that the 
“use of force”  in poisoning  “is not the act of ‘sprinkl [ing]’  
the poison; it is the act of employing poison knowingly 
as a device to cause physical harm.”   Id. at 171 ( brackets  
in original ).  Thus, the “use” of force in murder —
whether it be committed by poison, gun, starvation,  
suffocation, or preexisting disease , see id. at 170 -171—
necessarily involves “employing” lethal force to effect  
the death , id. at 171 .  That can be accomplished by ab-
staining from a legal duty , so as to allow a physical force 
to kill the victim,  just as much as it can by any other 
deliberate employment  of force .   
iii. Notwithstanding the consistent teachings of dic-
tionaries and this Court’s precedents  construing the 
relevant terms, petitioner asserts  (Br. 12 -13) that in 
common parlance, to “use” force requires an affirmative 
action to “convert[] force to [the actor’s] service”  and 
that Section 924(c)(3)(A) should incorporate such a lim-
itation.  That  assertion  is unsound .   
A car owner , for example,  can “use” the force of the 
rain to wash off grime  simply by leaving the car parked 
on the street .  A farmer can “use” the force of wind or a 
rushing stream to power a pump simply by allowing a 
windmill or water wheel to continue functioning.  And a 
rancher can “use” the force of a natural brush fire to 
clear unwanted scrub by not taking affirmative step s to 
put the fire out.   

22 
 This  Court  has itself referred to the “use” of forces 
that the actor did not “unleash [],” Pet. Br. 13.   In Asso-
ciation for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, 
Inc., 569 U.S. 576 (2013),  this Court explained how the 
process of synthetically creating DNA “us es the natural 
bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new, syn-
thetic DNA molecule.”  Id. at 582.  Those natural prop-
erties long predate  the scientists.  The Court’s applica-
tion of “use” reflects unexceptional English terminol-
ogy.

It is similarly unremarkable to say that river rafters 
“use the current to paddle from one side of the river to 
the other.”   Neil Ulman, Surviving White Water , Wall 

23 
 St. J., June 7, 1996 , at A10 .  And a s the government ob-
served  in briefing at the certiorari stage (Br. 1 4), raft-
ers would likewise be “us[ing]  * * *  the river’s natural 
current” if they were not paddling at all, but simply tak-
ing advantage of the current  to carry them onward.  Pe-
titioner asserts  (Br. 32) that the river -rafting example 
does not count because even if the rafter sits idly on the 
raft, allowing the current to carry him forward, he must 
take some action to position himself and the raft in the 
first instance.  But “use” of the current does not depend 
on some preceding action.  A rafter involuntarily thrown 
off a boat onto the raft could likewise “use” the current 
to travel downriver.   
b.  The law of murder and other crimes has tradition-
ally viewed  “omissions” as “acts”  
Petitioner’s effort to introduce an affirmative act re-
quirement into Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s  elements clause is 
not only atextual, but also conflicts with the longstand-
ing legal equivalence between “acts” and “omissions.”   
The criminal law generally does not play word games 
about whether denying medicine should be described as 
“failing to provide ” it or affirmatively “withholding ” it.   
Either  would typically lead to criminal liability, and le-
gal authorities would describe both as the “use ” of force.  
Congress presumably understood that and meant for 
Section 924(c)(3)(A) to work the same way. 
i. Recognition of the  equivalence of affirmative acts 
and acts of omission for purposes of criminal liability 
dates back at least to Roman times.  Roman law  “penal-
ized homicide  brought about by means of wilful starva-
tion, or by failure to complete a surgical operation.”  
Otto Kirchheimer, Criminal Omissions , 55 Harv. L. Rev. 
615, 615 ( 1942).    

24 
 English law likewise rejected a distinction between 
affirmative acts and omission s.  Blackstone, for exam-
ple, described a “crime” as “an act committed , or omit-
ted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or 
commanding it.”   4 William Blackstone, Commentaries 
on the Laws of England  5 (1769) (capitalization omit-
ted).  And in addressing  murder, Hawkins explained 
that “ he who wilfully neglects to prevent a Mischief, 
which he may , and ought to provide against, is, as some 
have said, in Judgment of the Law, the actual Cause of 
the Damage which ensues.”   1 William Hawkins, A 
Treatise of th e Pleas of the Crown 79 (1716) .   
In accord with those authorities,  English defendants 
could be, and were,  charged with and convicted of hom-
icide or manslaughter for abstaining from a required 
duty, such as the duty to feed a child .  See Regina  v. 
Conde , (1867) 10 Cox C.C. 547 (willful murde r charge 
against  parents , mother convicted of manslaughter ); 
see also, e.g., Regina v. Marriott , (1838) 173 Eng. Rep. 
559 (defendant convicted of manslaughter for confining 
an elderly woman  without food ); Rex v. Saunders , 
(1836) 173 Eng. Rep. 122 , 123  (noting that if a woman’s 
“husband supplied her with food for [an illegitimate] 
child, and she wilfully neglected to give it to the ch ild, 
and thereby caused its death, it might be murder in 
her”); Rex v. Friend , (1802) 168 Eng. Rep. 662 (defend-
ant indicted for failure to provide sufficient food and 
bedding to an apprentice) .  While some defendants were 
acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence of a duty, see, 
e.g., Saunders , 173 Eng. Rep. at 123, “omission” of a re-
quired act was an accepted basis for homicide liability.   
ii. American law followed the same course .  In Ter-
ritory v. Manton , 19 P. 387 (Mont. 1888), for example, 
the Supreme Court of the Territory of Montana upheld 

25 
 a husband’s manslaughter conviction for leaving his in-
toxicated wife lying in the snow, causing her to die from 
exposure. See id. at 393 -394.  The court explained that 
“wherever there is a legal duty, and death comes by rea-
son of any omission to discharge it, the party omitting 
it is guilty of a felonious homicide.”   Id. at 392  (quoting 
2 Joel Prentiss Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal 
Law § 68 9, at 375 (4th ed. 18 68) (Bishop) ).  The court  
held that  “[t]he very volition of the defendant which led 
him to refuse aid to his wife, when the law imposed the 
duty upon him to protect her, is transferred to the vio-
lence of the elements, and he is made to use their forces , 
and hence is responsible for the death they immediately 
caused.”  Ibid . (emphasis added).   
The court  in Manton  thus both rejected a distinction 
between affirmative acts and “ ‘omission [s],’ ” and ex-
pressly described  the husband’s conduct as a “use [of] 
force []” to cause death.  19 P. at 392.  Other American 
jurisdictions similarly based criminal conviction s on 
such “omission s.”  See, e.g., People v. Beardsley , 113 
N.W. 1128, 1128 (Mich. 1907) (“The law recognizes that 
under some circumstances the omission of a duty owed 
by one individual to another, where such omission re-
sults in the death of the one to whom the duty is owing, 
will make the other chargeable with manslaughter.”);  
State v. Smith , 65 Me. 257, 267 (1876) (“It is settled be-
yond a question that the naked negligent omission of a 
known duty, when it causes or hastens the death of a 
human being, constitutes manslaughter.”) .   
As an early treatise cited in Manton explained —in a 
section on “[t]he kinds of force by which life is tak en”—
“whenever the volition, of whatever kind, put forth by 
one man, results in the death of another  man , the for-
mer is to be charged with having committed the homi-

26 
 cide.”  Bishop  § 682, at 371 .  The treatise emphasized  
that “it is immaterial whether the action be of the mind 
or the body; whether it operated solely , or concurrently 
with other things;   * * *  whether it was a blow, or a 
drug,  *  * *  or a leaving of a dependent person in a place 
of exposure, or any omission of a duty which the law en-
joins.”  Ibid . (footnotes omitted).    
iii. The longstanding refusal to draw a rigid distinc-
tion between affirmative “acts” and “omissions”  has sound 
conceptual grounding .  As commentators have recog-
nized, “[t]here is no such thing, in fact, as an omission 
that can be treated as an absolute blank.   A man who is 
apparently inactive is actually doing something, even 
though that something is the cancelling of something 
else that he ought to have done.”  Francis Wharton, A 
Treatise on the Law of Homicide in the United States  
§ 72, at 50 ( 2d ed. 1875).  Put another way, “the relevant 
‘act’ consists not of the forbearance, but of overtly doing 
something other than what the defendant was legally 
obliged to do.”   Jerome Hall, Gene ral Principles of 
Criminal Law  198 ( 2d ed. 1960)  (Hall) .  Nero did not 
merely  “omit” to rescue Rome; he fiddled while it 
burned.   
There is no reason to differentiate between  a care-
giver who affirmatively removes life -giving medication 
from a bedridden patient’s reach and a caregiver who 
otherwise withholds the medication in violation of  his 
duty to provide it.  The former case might  be classified 
as an affirmative act in which  “the defendant initiates 
the subjection of his victim to certain physical forces or 
* * *  initiates the aggravation of already operative 
forces .”  Hall 197.  And the latter might be character-
ized as an “omission, ” in which the defendant “does not 
initiate the occurrence of the harm, but he permits cur-

27 
 rent forces to take a toll which he could prevent.”  Ibid .  
But “there is no essential difference in conduct or cau-
sation .”  Ibid.   In both cases, “there is use of , there is 
‘cooperation with,’ those external forces .”  Ibid .  (em-
phasis added).  
iv. Consistent with that view, by the time Congress 
enacted Section 924(c) and the “crime of violence” defi-
nition, the Model Penal Code had long taken the posi-
tion that an omission when there is a duty to act should 
be treated as a criminally culpable act ion.  See Model 
Penal Code § 1.13(7) (19 85) (as adopted at the 1962 An-
nual Meeting of the American Law Institute, May 24, 
1962) .  And by the time the elements clause was first 
incorporated into Section 924(c) , New York and at least 
34 other jurisdictions had likewise enacted statutes 
adopting that view.  See N.Y. Penal Law § 15.00(3) and 
(5) (1975) (“ ‘Omission’ means a failure to perform an act

 In seven  additional  jurisdictions , courts had en-
dorsed “omissions ” liability in cases of murder or man-
slaughter.4  And o ther jurisdictions have since recog-
nized such liability —in cases that presumably describe 
what the law has always been , see George  v. McDonough , 
596 U.S. 740, 751 (2022) ( acknowledging “general prin-
ciple[]” that “a judicial decision states what [a] statute 
‘always meant ’ ”) (citation omitted).5  Indeed, the gov-
ernment is not aware of any jurisdiction that has ex-
pressly rejected omissions  liability.6   
When Congress enacted Section 924(c), it presuma-
bly “ was aware of the [] background principles recogniz-
ing that the elements of a crime —including the causation 
elements of crimes such as murder and manslaughter —
can be satisfied by acts of omission as well as acts of 
commission.”  Scott , 990 F.3d at 115 ; see, e.g., Miles  v.

 Apex Marine Corp. , 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990) (“We assume 
that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes 
legislation.”).  There is every reason to believe that Con-
gress intended the elements clause to encompass those 
principles.  See Samantar v. Yousuf , 560 U.S. 305, 320 
n.13 (2010) (“Congress ‘is understood to legislate 
against a background of common law  .  . .  principles.’  ”)

B. Excluding “Omissions ” Would Defeat The Design Of 
Section 924(c)(3)(A) And Similar Elements Clauses By 
Cutting Out  Paradigmatically Violent Crimes  
The genesis of the elements clause in Section 924(c) , 
and similarly worded elements clauses , underscores 
that Congress designed the clause to encompass quin-
tessentially violent offenses like murder , assault , and 
robbery —many of which would be at risk of exclusion 
under petitioner’s reading.  The Court should not adopt 
an interpretation that would effectively render Section 
924(c) —as well as other elements -clause statutes like 
the domestic -abuser proscription in Section 922(g)(9 )—
“self -defeating .”  Quarles  v. United States , 587 U.S. 645, 
654 (2019).    
1. As petitioner recognizes  (Pet. 27 -28), adopting his in-
terpretation of the elements clause in Section 924(c)(3) (A) 
would  have broad ramifications for materially identical 
language in numerous statutes.  Analogous  clauses ap-
pear in , or are cross -referenced by,  the ACCA,  see 18 
U.S.C. 924(e) ; the pretrial detention statute, see 18 
U.S.C. 3142(g) ; the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
see 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(F) ; the Sentencing Guidelines, 
see Sentencing Guidelines  § 4B1.2(a)(1) ; and the prohi-
bition on firear m possession by misdemeanant domestic 
abusers, see 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9).   

30 
 Contrary to petitioner’s contention s (Br. 25 -27), the 
history of the most similar clause —the ACCA’s  defini-
tion of a potentially sentence -enhancing “violent fel-
ony,”  see 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2)(B)(i) —cuts against him.   
The current version of the ACCA was an effort to retain  
its “original predicate offenses ” of robbery and bur-
glary, while also giving the statute “greater sweep” by 
amending it “to apply to career criminals whose prior 
offenses may be murder” or “rape.”  Armed Career 
Criminal Legislation: Hearing on H.R. 4639 and H.R. 
4768 Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House 
Comm. on the Judiciary , 99th Cong., 2d S ess. 44, 46 -47 
(1986) (statement of Senator Specter)  (ACCA Hearing ).  
And  the House Report for the relevant 198 6 amendment 
specifically identified “murder, rape, assault [and] rob-
bery” as among the crimes “involving physical force 
against a person ”—i.e., elements -clause crimes .  H.R. 
Rep. No. 849, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1986) ; see ACCA 
Hearing  2 (Rep. Hughes urging amendment of the 
ACCA to reach “murder, rape, assault, robbery,  
et cetera ,” which he viewed as “felonies involving phys-
ical force against a person”).    
The specific definition of “crime of violence” in Sec-
tion 924(c) has a similar pedigree.  In adopting that def-
inition in several  places in the code, see United States 
v. Davis , 588 U.S. 445, 460 (2019) , the Senate Judiciary 
Committee explained that the elements clause “would 
include a threatened or attempted simple assault or bat-
tery on another person ,” S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 
1st Sess. 307 (1983)  (footnotes omitted) .  In contrast, 
“offenses such as burglary  *  * *  would be included in 
the latter ” residual  clause , “inasmuch as such an offense 
would involve the substantial risk of physical force 
against another person or against the property.”  Ibid.    

31 
 That explanation indicates that Congress viewed the 
elements clause as encompassing crimes , like certain 
forms of battery , in which physical injury necessarily 
results , or was threatened or attempted, and thus the 
“use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical 
force” is always present.  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(A); s ee  
2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 
16.2(a), at 750 (3d ed. 201 8) (describing one form of bat-
tery as requiring a “bodily injury” ).  The residual 
clause, in contrast, was focused on crimes with  merely a 
“risk” that physical force “ may be used in the course of 
committing the offense,” 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3)(B) (empha-
ses added), and thus bodily injury was not guaranteed.   
2. Construing the elements clause to exclude crimes 
that may be completed by withholding required conduct 
would eviscerate  Section 924(c) (3)(A)  and similarly 
worded elements clauses .  Had Congress intended to 
exclude such crimes at the time it enacted Section 
924(c)(3)(A),  it would have risked excluding federal of-
fenses such as murder in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1111; vol-
untary manslaughter in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1112(a); 
and retaliating against a witness and causing bodily in-
jury in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1513(b).  See App., infra , 
25a-27a; see United States  v. Christie , 717 F.3d 1156, 
1160 -1161 (10th Cir. 2013) (federal conviction for second -
degree murder based on failure to feed a child).  And for 
purposes of offenses incorporated into federal law by 
the VICAR statute  and other statutes —and, even more 
significantly, for purposes of the ACCA’s elements 
clause —such an approach would have risked excluding  
murder offenses in 4 8 jurisdictions, assault or battery 
offenses in 27 jurisdictions , and robbery offens es in  
9 jurisdictions , that involve caus ing or threat ening  bod-
ily injury or death .  See App., infra , 11a-24a.  

32 
 This Court has “repeatedly declined to construe ” el-
ements clauses “ in a way that would render [them]  in-
applicable ” to crimes in numerous States.   Stokeling   v. 
United States , 586 U.S. 73, 81 (2019)  (declining to con-
strue “physical force” in ACCA’s elements clause in a 
way that would exclude at least 31 States’ robbery stat-
utes);  see Voisine , 579 U.S . at 695  (declining to construe 
18 U.S.C. 921(a)(33)(A)  (2012)  in a way that would “jeop-
ardize” 18 U.S.C. 922(g)’s efficacy  in 34 States plus the 
District of Columbia); Castleman , 572 U.S. at 167 -168 
(declining to construe definition of “misdemeanor crime 
of domestic violence”  in a way that would render Section 
922(g) (9) “ineffectual in at least 10 States”) .  The Court 
should take the same approach here.   
Indeed, excluding “omissions ” would largely undo 
this Court’s work  in Castleman and Voisine to preserve 
the domestic -violence  crimes that are predicates under  
Section 922(g) (9).  Because the term “use” is the same 
there as here, see Borden , 593 U.S. at 430 (plurality 
opinion), petitioner’ s reading of “use” wou ld appear to 
exclude many of the very same assault laws  that Cas-
tleman and Voisine preserved .  The vast majority of 
those crimes  involve causation of injury  that might  be 
accomplished  by withholding required conduct.  See 
U.S. Br. App. at 10a-29a, Castleman , supra  (No. 12 -
1371)  (gathering state laws) ; U.S. Br. App. at 7a-24a, 
Voisine , supra  (No. 14 -10154)  (same) .   
That result cannot be squared with  Congress’s en-
actment of Section 922(g)(9) “to bar those domestic 
abusers convicted of garden -variety assault ” misde-
meanors, which are frequently based on the “infliction 
of bodily harm ,” Voisine , 579 U.S. at 695 —or the 
Court’s approach in Castleman and Voisine .     

33 
 C. Petitioner’s Reading Of Section 924(c) Is Textually And 
Practically Unsound  
Petitioner provides no sound reason to excise  mur-
der and numerous other offenses from elements clause s.  
Lacking grounding in the text, structure, purpose , or 
history of Section 924(c) for the extraordinary conclu-
sion that murder is not a  crime of violence , petitioner 
attempts to impose extratextual limitations on the stat-
ute, engages in self-contradictory reasoning, and incor-
rectly assumes that the least -culpable version of the 
crime is the only  one Congress would have considered 
relevant.   
1. Physical force does not require external physical 
contact  
Petitioner ’s assertion that “ ‘physical force ’ ” must 
originate “from contact with the external world ” cannot 
be squared with either this Court’s precedent  or com-
mon understanding .  Br. 17 -18 (citation omitted) .  As 
previously noted, see p. 17, supra , petitioner himself re-
peatedly acknowledges that poisoning —which can be 
accomplished through a nonviolent “sprinkling,” Cas-
tleman , 572 U.S. at 171  (brackets omitted) —would in-
volve “physical force.”  And a s previously explained , see 
p. 21, supra , Castleman identifies the “physical force” 
in cases involving poison, disease, and the like as the in-
ternal force within the body that cause s physical injury 
or death .  572 U.S. at 170 -171 (citations omitted) .     
Despite accepting the poisoning example, petitioner  
nonetheless insists  (Br. 37 -38) that Castleman  is irrele-
vant because it  addressed misdemeanor -level  common -
law force  rather than felony -level violent force .  But as 
already explained, pp. 16-17, supra , the only relevant 
difference between common -law force and violent force  
is the potential harmfulness of the force .  The additional 

34 
 require ment  for force to be violent —“force capable of 
causing physical pain or injury to another person,” 
Johnson , 559 U.S. at 140—plainly exists  when the force 
actually causes physical pain , injur y, or death.   See Cas-
tleman , 572 U.S. at 174 (Scalia, J., concurring in part 
and concurring in the judgment) .7   
Petitioner finds no  support for his position in Stokel-
ing v. United States .  There, the Court held that “force 
sufficient to overcome a [robbery] victim’s resistance” 
qualifies as violent force, but that “ [m]ere ‘snatching of 
property from another ,’ ” without resistance from the 
victim, does not.  586 U.S. at 75, 85-86 (citation omitted) .  
But petitioner errs in asserting that “[i] f the amount of 
force involved in the snatching of property from another 
falls short of satisfying the elements clause,  then a for-
tiori so does the amount of force required for a crime 
that can be  committed by failing to provide nutrition or 
medical assistance. ”  Br. 21 -22 (citation omitted).  If the 
only  force involved is the snatching, then it is not cate-
gorically capable of causing pain or injury.  But the op-
 
7  Petitioner notes ( Br. 38 n.8) that Justice Scalia’s concurrence in 
Castleman criticized an amicus’s broad reading of the “misde-
meanor crime of domestic violence” definition to include, inter alia , 
“acts of omission,” 572 U.S. 181 (citation omitted).  But that refer-
ence to “acts of omission” —which was listed alongside acts that “hu-
miliate, isolate, [and] frighten ” a victim, but may not result in phys-
ical harm , ibid. (citation omitted) —did not preclude Justice Scalia 
from recognizing that “it is impossible to cause bodily injury without 
using force ‘capable of  ’ producing that result ,” id. at 174.  As dis-
cussed above, see p p. 23 -26, supra , “omission” liability for causation 
of bodily injury is a longstanding and commonplace feature of the 
law.  Indeed, it was Justice Scalia who authored the Court’s prece-
dent on the meaning of “violent” force, which endorsed a definition 
including “murder” and “assault and battery with a dangerous 
weapon,” Johnson , 559 U.S. at 1 40-141 (citation omitted) —the very 
crimes that petitioner would cut out.  

35 
 posite is true where the force is a physical process that 
injures or kills the victim.     
Petitioner similarly errs  in relying  (Br. 23)  on the 
dissent in Borden .  In the passage that petitioner cites, 
the dissent expressed the view that the word “against” 
in the ACCA’s elements clause should not be construed 
to require  that the victim be the defendant’s target  (as 
the plurality concluded) , but should instead be con-
strued to mean “making contact with .”  Borden , 593 
U.S. at  465 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) ( brackets  and 
citation  omitted ).  But that view does not suggest that 
the elements clause nec essitates  external  contact .    
Under the plain language of the clause, it is the 
“physical force” —not the offender —that makes contact 
with the victim.  18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2)(B)(i).  And in every 
case involving bodily injury or death, contact between 
the force and the victim is what causes the injury or 
death.  See p p. 15-16, supra .  In a poisoning, for exam-
ple, the relevant contact is simply the internal  bodily 
process whereby the poison kills the victim.  See Cas-
tleman , 572 U.S. at 171.    
Finally, petitioner ’s invocation  (Br. 34)  of the “egg-
shell skull” victim , who may be seriously injured even 
by minimal physical force , does nothing to undermine 
the commonsense proposition  that force is necessarily 
capable of causing injury when injury actually results .  
The Court rejected a similar argument  in Stokeling .  
There, the Court recognized  that “the force necessary 
to overcome a [robbery] victim’s physical resistance is 
inherently ‘violent ,’ ” “even” when it involves  “a feeble 
or weak -willed victim”  who may not supply much re-
sistance .  586 U.S. at 83.    
The same logic applies here .  Murder is not excluded 
from the elements clause  simply because a defendant 

36 
 might  kill a victim teetering over the edge of a cliff with 
a gentle touch , or a deathly allergic  victim with peanut 
oil.  Both examples involve “physical force” that is cate-
gorically “capable of causing physical pain or injury to 
another person,” Johnson , 559 U.S. at 140 —the victim 
who dies.  
2. Petitioner ’s narrow interpretation of “use  * * * 
against the person or property of another ” is insup-
portable  
Petitioner  errs in insisting that to “ ‘use’ ” force 
“ ‘against the person or property of another ’ ” entails  
“directly administer [ing]  force, or tak [ing] a step that 
causes force to be administered .”  Br. 12 .  As already 
explained, pp. 17-23, supra , neither dictionaries nor this 
Court’s precedents support such a constricted view.  
And petitioner is wrong to contend  otherwise .   
a. To the extent that petitioner view s a phrase like 
“he used  the victim’s disease against her ” as incorrect 
or unnatural, that view cannot be squared with Cas-
tleman .  Castleman  focus ed on the “physical force ” as 
the action of the  disease rather than any conduct of the 
defendant himself  and recognized that when the defend-
ant “employ [s] poison” or “ ‘disease ’ ” “knowingly as a 
device to cause physical harm,” the defendant “us[ es]” 
that internal force.   572 U.S. at 170 -171 (citations omit-
ted).   
Petitioner assert s (Br. 36 -37 & n.7) that Castleman ’s 
holding applies only if the defendant causes bodily in-
jury “in a real ( i.e., non -legal) sense.”  But petitioner 
provides no basis for imposing that restriction, which 
appears nowhere in Castleman ’s reasoning.  Elements 
clauses , and the categorical approach that they have 
been interpreted to require, are  creatures of law.  And 
as such, they are  informed by background legal princi-

37 
 ples treating “omissions” as the equivalent of affirma-
tive acts for purposes of forcible crimes like murder.   
See pp. 23-29, supra .   
Petitioner recognizes (Br. 33) the historical legal 
view  of “omissions ,” but disputes its relevance to the 
meaning of Section 924(c)(3) .  In his view ( ibid. ), that 
long -held legal understanding  has no bearing on 
whether  the phrase “use of physical force against the 
person or property of another”  encompasses omissions.   
But authoriti es expressly drew the connection between  
an “omission ” and the “use of force .”  See pp. 25-26, su-
pra.  And that is how the elements clause is written.  It 
is not written in any s pecial way  that would incorporate 
petitioner’s asserted “affirmative conduct” require-
ment.    
b. Petitioner invokes (Br. 12, 15, 22 -23) various state-
ments  in this Court’s opinions defining the “use of phys-
ical force against the person or property of another” to 
require  “ ‘volitional’ or ‘active’ employment of force.”  
Borden , 593 U.S. at 430 (plurality opinion) (citation 
omitted); see Voisine , 579 U.S. at 692-693 (“  use” re-
quires “active employment”); Leocal , 543 U.S. at 9 
(same).  But petitioner errs in asserting (Br. 12 -14, 22-
24) that by referring to “active employment” that “di-
rect[s] force” against another , the Court excluded acts 
of “omission. ”   
In each of the  relevant  cases, the Court was focused 
on the “  ‘degree of intent’  ” that the statute required to 
connect the defendant’s conduct with the causation of 
the victim’s injury.  Borden , 593 U.S. at 434 (plurality 
opinion) (quoting Leocal , 543 U.S. at 9).  In that context, 
the Court included  the modifier “active” to contrast 
with “accidental,” “involuntary,” or “reckless” employ-
ment of force.  See id. at 430-431; Voisine , 579 U.S. at 

38 
 692-693; Leocal , 543 U.S. at 9.  The Court did not in-
clude the modifier to contrast with the employment  of 
force  through “omission,” which was not at issue in any 
of those cases.  
c. Petitioner also errs in his reliance ( Br. 30 -31) on  
this Court’s analysis in Bailey v. United States of when 
a defendant “uses  *  * *  a firearm” “during and in rela-
tion to a ny crime of violence or drug trafficking crime .”  
18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)  (1994) .  Bailey ’s conclusion that  
“use” in that context “requires evidence sufficient to 
show an active employment of the firearm by the de-
fendant, a use that makes the firearm an operative fac-
tor in relation to the predicate offense ,” 516 U.S. at 143  
(emphasis omitted), does not support his argument 
here .     
The Court in Bailey  explained  that “  ‘[u]se’ draws 
meaning from its context” and found that in the partic-
ular context of t he provision at issue , “ ‘use’ must con-
note more than mere possession of a firearm by a per-
son who commits a drug offense.”  516 U.S. at  143.  
Based on definitions such as “  ‘to carry out a purpose or 
action by means of ,’ ” the Court observed  that “various 
definitions” of “use” imply “action and implementation .”  
Id. at 145 (citation omitted).  And t he Court  reasoned 
that unlike  in other firearm statutes , Congress had not 
used the word “ ‘possess,’  ” id. at 143 ; that construing the 
existing language to include possession could render 
the statute ’s reference to “carr[ying]” a firearm super-
fluous, id. at 145 -146; and that such an interpretation 
would create an “impossible line -drawing problem ,” id. 
at 149.   
None of that  context exists  here.   And Bailey ’s “ac-
tive employment” requirement would be satisfied in this 
context  because force is always an “operative factor,” 

39 
 516 U.S. at 143, in a crime in which the victim is injured 
or killed.  It is not possible for force to “play[] no detect-
able role in the crime’s commission .”  Id. at 147.  The 
defendant in such a crime does not simply “possess” the 
force; instead,  the defendant has “carr [ied]  out a pur-
pose or action  by means of  ” the force , id. at 145  (citation 
omitted) —specifically, injuring or killing the victim .   
d. Finally, petitioner’s effort  (Br. 16 -17) to import an 
affirmative act requirement from Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s 
application to crimes involving “attempted use” and 
“threatened use”  of force is misguided.  As an initial 
matter, petitioner is incorrect that an attempt requires 
affirmative conduct .  This very case arises only because 
New York attempted murder —like attempted murder 
in an overwhelming majority of other jurisdictions —can 
be committed by “omission.”   For example,  a defendant 
may take a “substantial step” toward murder  by with-
holding food from a child, only to be thwarted when the 
child acquires food some other way.  And while it is true 
that threatening to use force requires affirmative com-
munication  of a threat , that requirement is a result of 
the meaning of “threat,” not the meaning of “ use.”  See 
United States  v. Taylor , 596 U.S. 845, 856 (2022).  
In any event, there is no sound reason why the un-
modified meaning of “use” should import a meaning 
from separate instances  of the same word that have  ad-
jectival modifiers.  A reference to “lawyers, former law-
yers, and aspiring lawyers” does not suggest a ny limi-
tation  on “lawyers” —it instead expands the phrase to 
include related, but distinct, categories.  The same is 
true of “use” in Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s elements clause .  

40 
 3. Petitioner’s view of Section 924(c)’s structure, pur-
pose, and history is incorrect and self-contradictory  
Petitioner  claims  (Br. 23 -29) that the structure , pur-
pose , and his tory of Section 924(c) are inconsistent with 
interpreting the statute to reach crimes like murder , 
which  may be comm itted by withholding required con-
duct.  Yet at the same time, petitioner also claims (Br. 
39-42) that Congress did include such crimes, but only 
in the uncons titutional residual clause.  Those claims 
cannot both be correct.  And, i n fact,  neither is.   
a. With respect to the structure of Section 924(c), 
petitioner contends (Br. 23 -25) that other requirements 
of the Section 924(c) offense, and several of its potential 
sentence enhancements , “plainly contemplate espe-
cially dangerous criminals who commit crimes of vio-
lence with deadly weapons.”  And he argues  (Br. 23-24) 
that a definition of “crime of violence” that includes 
“omission” -based conduct would be an “awkward fit  for 
this framework. ”  That argument makes little  sense .   
As petitioner acknowledges (Br. 24 n.6), Section 
924(c)’s requirement  of using, carrying, or possessing a 
firearm is “not subject to the categorical approach and 
instead must be satisfied by the defendant’s own con-
duct.”   When such firearm -based conduct is proved, there  
is little risk that the underlying “crime of violence” is in 
fact something like an “omission” -based withholding of 
medicine .  And w ith statistics from 2021 showing that 
more than 80 % of murders in the United States  that 
year  involv ed a fire arm,8 it is fanciful  to suggest that the

About Gun Deaths in the U.S.  (Apr. 26, 2023) https://www.
pewresearch.org/ short -reads/2023/04/26/what -the-data -says -about - 
gun-deaths -in-the-u-s/ (noting that 20,958 out of 26,031 —81%—of 
U.S. murders in 2021 involved a firearm).   

41 
 requirement of firearm involvement indicates that Sec-
tion 924(c)  does not reach murder .   
b. The same  blinkered view of murder and similar 
crimes  likewise  pervades  petitioner’s argument  (Br. 25-
27) that a crime committ able  by “omission” does not im-
plicate Section 924(c)’s purposes.  When a firearm is 
used, carried, or possessed in connection with a murder, 
that murder is obviously violent .  Envision ing an “omis-
sion” -based murder that involves  a firearm  in one of 
those ways  is difficult, if not impossible.  
It is implausible that Congress would have wanted to 
exclude murder from Section 924(c)(3) in light of such 
an unrealistic hypothetical .  Petitioner ignores that his 
arguments in this case would remove from Section 924(c)  
not just  murder  committed by withholding required 
conduct , but (under the prevailing categorical ap-
proach) all murder —including th e firearm -involved 
murders that would be  Section 924(c)’s  focus .  The con-
sequences of that position are extreme , as recent expe-
rience illustrates .    
The Third Circuit is the only court of appeals to have 
adopted petitioner’s argument .  See United States v. 
Mayo , 901 F.3d 218 (2018) .  Based on that decision , a 
district court rejected one federal predicate for the Sec-
tion 924(c) charge s against Robert Bowers , who opened 
fire in the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh , killing 
11 people and wounding six, see United States v. Bow-
ers, No. 18 -cr-292, 2022 WL 17718686 , at *6  (W.D. P a. 
Dec. 15, 2022 ); see  Campbell Robertson  et al., Rampage 
Kills 11 at a Synago gue in Pittsburgh , N.Y. Times, Oct. 
28, 2018 , at A1 .  The district court reasoned that the 
predicate crime under 18 U.S.C. 249(a)(1), which pro-
hibits “willfully caus[ing] bodily injury to any person  
* * *  because of the actual or perceived race, color, re-

42 
 ligion, or national origin of any person,” may be accom-
plished through “omissions ” and therefore “cannot be a 
crime of violence.”  Bowers , 2022 WL 17718686, at  *6.  
Endorsing petitioner’s view would also affect other Sec-
tion 924(c) prosecutions; for example, the  government 
would be required to drop capital murder charges under 
Section 924(c)  and (j)  against Payton Gendron, who shot 
13 people and killed 10 in a race -motivated shooting in 
a Buffalo grocery store.  See D. Ct. Doc. 180 , at 24 -25, 
United States v. Gendron , No. 22-cr-109 (W.D.N.Y.  
June 10, 20 24) (defendant’s motion to dismiss preserv-
ing the argument that petitioner makes here).   
Petitioner’s argument would likewise extend to nu-
merous cases like his own, in which gang members 
planned to , or did, kill someone with a gun —here, a gun 
that petitioner himself supplied .  See p. 4, supra ;  see, 
e.g., United States v. Ortiz -Orellana , 90 F.4th 689, 696 
(4th Cir. 2024) ( murder of a rival gang member  shot 
three times in the head), petition for cert. pending, No. 
24-5040  (filed July 8, 2024) ; Allen v. United States , No. 
21-5782, 2023 WL 4145321, at *1 (6th Cir. June 23, 2023) 
(gang shooting with five victims), petition for cert. 
pending, No. 23 -918 (filed Feb. 22, 2024) .  Petitioner  
cannot plausibly claim that excluding those offenses 
would be consistent with the statutory purposes  of Sec-
tion 924(c) , or with any sensible meaning of the term 
“crime of violence .”   
c. Petitioner’s reliance ( Br. 26) on the asserted pur-
poses of the ACCA’s  similarly worded  elements clause  
is likewise misplaced.  To the extent that the ACCA’s 
elements clause attempts to describe recidivists who 
are “the kind of person who might deliberately point the 
gun and pull the trigger ,” Begay v. United States , 553 
U.S. 137, 146 (2008) , a person who commits or attempts 

43 
 to commit murder is precisely  that sort of person .  In-
deed, as noted above, about 80% of murders are carried 
out with a gun.   See p. 40 & n.8, supra .   
Furthermore, even considering the small subset of 
cases involving the withholding of required conduct, pe-
titioner is wrong to suggest ( Br. 26) that such offenses 
necessarily do not involve “violent, aggressive, and pur-
poseful ‘armed career criminal’ behavior.”  Begay , 553 
U.S. at 14 8; see id. at 147-148.  Both cases that peti-
tioner cites (Br. 18) as examples of commission of mur-
der by “omission”  involved undeniably violent and ag-
gressive defendants .  In each case, a father brutally 
beat a child and then denied the child medical attention.  
See People v. Steinberg , 7595 N.E.2d 845, 846 (N.Y.  
1992) ; People v. Best , 609 N.Y.S.2d 478 , 479 -480 (N.Y. 
App. Div. 1994) .  Even assuming that the juries in those 
cases premised their guilty verdicts on the denial of 
medical care, there is no reason to suppose that those 
defendants have not exhibited the type of conduct cov-
ered by the ACCA .  Indeed, many murders committed 
by “omission” —such as deliberately starving a child —
are among the most heinous homicides imaginable, re-
quiring an extended course of premeditated conduct in 
which the victim is literally tortured to death.   
The issue in this case  is far afield from  the issue in  
Chambers v. United States , 555 U.S. 122 (2009), where  
this Court opined that the crime of failing to report to 
prison was a “crime [that] amounts to a form of inac-
tion” in the ordinary case and did not fall within the pur-
poses of the ACCA or the text of its residual clause.  Id. 
at 128.  Instead, a dopting petitioner’s position here 
would completely untether the meaning of a “violent fel-
ony” or “crime of violence”  from reality, leading to be-

44 
 wildering and arbitrary sentencing disparities based on 
hypertechnical distinctions and hypothetical crimes.   
d. The legislative history on which petitioner relies  
provides no meaningful support for the bizarre  and un-
just result he seeks .  Rather than focusing on the his-
tory of Section 924(c)(3)(A) or other elements clauses, 
he principally discusses (Br. 27 -29) the history of a  dif-
ferent crime i n an unenacted provision of an unenacted 
bill. 
In that bill, which predate d Section 924(c), a differ-
ent Congress considered adopting an offense of “Ter-
rorizing,” which would have prohibited the communica-
tion of “a threat to commit, or to continue to commit, a 
federal, State , or local crime of violence or unlawful con-
duct dangerous to human life.”  Criminal Code Reform 
Act of 1981, S. 1630, § 1615(a)(1), 97th Cong. , 1st Sess. 
(1981) .  The definition of a “crime of violence”  would 
have been  the same as the one later included in Section 
924(c), and the Senate Report indicated that the draft-
ers believed that  the additional phrase “unlawful con-
duct dangerous to human life  * * * may have a broader 
application.”  S. Rep. No. 307, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 591 
(1981)  (emphasis added) .  As an example of that possi-
bility, the report hypothesized  that if a dam operator 
“threaten[ed] to refuse to open the floodgates during a 
flood” and placed residents “in jeopardy of their lives,” 
that would qualify as  a threat to engage in unlawful con-
duct, but would not be a crime of violence because the 
dam operator  “did not use or threaten to use physical 
force.”   Ibid .   
Petitioner’s speculation that Congress had the same 
understanding years later , in enacting a wholly differ-
ent provision , is unfounded.  This Court has repeatedly 
warned of the “perils  of relying on the fate of prior bills 

45 
 to divine the meaning of enacted legislation.”  Caraco 
Pharm. Labs. , Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S , 566 U.S. 399, 
422 (2012).  The dangers of misconstruction are multi-
plied where, as here, the cited legislative history accom-
panied a prior bill that  never became law.   The Congress 
that passed the relevant  law is unlikely to have had in 
mind the Senate Report accompanying a proposed of-
fense that was never enacted.  And even if it did, the 
enacting Congress may have disagreed with the re-
port’s suggestion that the r eference to “unlawful con-
duct” was necessary given the breadth of the definition 
of a crime of violence.   
In any event, petitioner’s own reasoning is incon-
sistent with his reliance on t he Senate Report.  Peti-
tioner acknowledges (Br. 40) that committing a murder 
through the withholding of required conduct  would at 
least fall within Section 924(c)’s residual clause.  As a 
result , even on his view, the hypothetical dam operator 
would have been covered by the  proposed terrorism of-
fense’s  crime -of-violence definition, even absent a pro-
vision reaching unlawful conduct dangerous to human 
life.  Because the S enate Report’s reasoning is flawed 
under both  part ies’ interpretation s, it should  have no  
weight in the proper interpretation of Section 924(c) .   
e. Petitioner’s claim (Br. 40) that Congress intended 
to include  crimes committable by “omission”  only  under 
Section 924(c)’s residual clause is irreconcilable with his 
arguments that the structure, purpose, and history of 
Section 924(c)  indicate that Congress did not intend to 
include such offenses at all .  The claim is also incorrect.  
The residual clause  was not the  natural home for a 
crime , like murder, that inherently involve s causation of 
bodily injury or death .  The residual clause asks 
whether an offense “by its nature, involves a substantial 

46 
 risk that physical force against the person or property 
of another may  be used in the course of committing the 
offense.”  18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3) (B) (emphas es added) .  
That is not a natural way to describe murder and bodily -
injury crimes that always include physical harm or 
death.  
The residual clause is referred to as “residual” for a 
reason.   Congress designed t he elements  clause to in-
clude the most common violent offenses, like murd er 
and robbery.  S ee pp. 29-31, supra .  The residual clause 
was added to ensure coverage  of crimes in which the use 
of force was not inherent, but nonetheless substantially 
risked, like attempted burglary, see James v. United 
States , 550 U.S. 192 (2007), or vehicular flight from a 
law enforcement officer, see Sykes  v. United States , 564 
U.S. 1 (2011).   
Petitioner therefore cannot blame the unconstitu-
tionality of the residual clause for the unjustifiable re-
sults of his interpretation of Section 924(c).  Murder —
like most , if not all , crimes that satisfy the elements 
clause —would likely also have satisfied the residual 
clause.9  But the Court has never viewed that as a reason 
to deny the elements clause its proper scope.   See, e.g., 
Stokeling , 586 U.S. at 81 (“declin[ing] to construe” the 
ACCA’s elements clause “in a way that would render it 
inapplicable  [to robbery]  in many State s,” without con-
sidering the residual clause).    
 
9 The decision below could therefore alternatively be affirmed on 
the ground that murder would be encompassed by a constitutionally 
valid application of the residual clause .  See Borden , 593 U.S. at 445 -
449 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).   

47 
 D. The Rule Of Lenity Does Not Apply  
Petitioner’s argument of last resort is that the rule 
of lenity requires interpreting Section 924(c)’s elements 
clause to exclude his New York attempted -murder con-
viction .  See Br. 42 -43.  “But ‘the rule of lenity only ap-
plies if, after considering text, structure, history, and 
purpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncer-
tainty in the statute, such that the Court must simply 
guess as to what Congress intended.’  ”  Castleman , 572 
U.S. at 172 (quoting Barber  v. Thomas , 560 U.S. 474, 
488 (2010)); see Shular  v. United States , 589 U.S. 154, 
168 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring).   Petitioner’s ar-
gument is accordingly misplaced.   
For the reasons explained above, n o “grievous ambi-
guity ” exists here.  Even beyond the text and context , 
Castleman  supplies a “clear pronouncement that a de-
fendant ‘necessarily ’ uses physical force in committing 
a crime involving the intentional causation of physical 
injury. ”  Scott , 990 F.3d at 121 .  The Court has rejected 
similar requests for lenity in other “use of physical 
force” cases, including in Castleman .  See 572 U.S. at 
172-173.  It should do so again here, where Castleman  
and the statutory text eliminate any possible need to 
“simply guess ” as to  whether Congress intended mur-
der to qua lify as a “crime of violence.”   Id. at 173 (cita-
tion omitted).
