 The Motion will be heard by the Honorable Scott P. Klosterman at the United States  
District Court for the District of Wyoming, 2120 Capitol Avenue Cheyenne, WY 82001, and on a  
date and time to be set by the Court.  
In accordance with this Court’s Local Rule 7.1(b)(1)(a), the undersigned certifies that legal  
counsel for Defendants has in good faith conferred with legal counsel for Plaintiffs on these  
motions . 
INTRODUCTION  
This case arises from a catastrophic incident involving the explosion and subsequent fire 
of a defective hoverboard, specifically a Jetson Plasma Iridescent Hoverboard, purchased by the 
Plaintiff s from Walmart. On February 1, 2022, the hoverboard ’s lithium -ion battery 
malfunctioned, causing it to ignite and subsequently leading to significant property damage and 
serious burn injuries to Stephanie Wadsworth and Weston Wadsworth . All Plaintiffs suffered 
significant  emoti onal and psychological  trauma . Plaintiffs have sued  Defendants Walmart, Inc. 
and Jetson Electric Bikes, LLC for their roles in designing, manufacturing, marketing, and 
distributing the defective product. The Defendants deny Plaintiffs' allegations and contend that the 
fire originated outside of the home, a rguing that their product  was not defective.  
LEGAL STANDARD  
Motions in limine are utilized to exclude prejudicial or irrelevant evidence before it is 
presented to the jury. The Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 401, 402, and 403, 
govern the admissibility of evidence.  
1. Relevance (FRE 401 & 402) : Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. Relevant 
evidence is defined as evidence that makes a fact more or less probable than it 
would be without the evidence. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.  
 
2. Prejudicial Impact (FRE 403) : Even relevant evidence may be excluded if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 2 of 9
3 
 confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Courts have consistently held that 
evidence with a high potential for prejudice should be excluded to ensure a fair trial.  
 
Additionally, Wyoming case law reinforces these principles. In  Wyoming v. U.S. 
Department of Energy , 2006 WL 3801910 (D. Wyo. 2006), the court emphasized the importance 
of preventing jury confusion and undue prejudice. In  Holland v. Keller , 2018 WL 2446162 (D. 
Wyo. 2018), the court ruled that inflammatory evidence should be excluded , reinforcing the need 
to maintain a fair and impartial trial environment.  Further,  United States v. Hargrove , 2019 WL 
2516279 (D. Wyo. 2019), reiterated that evidence likely to cause unfair prejudice should be 
excluded  if it outweighs its probative value . Similarly, Meyer v. City of Cheyenne , 2017 WL 
3461055 (D. Wyo. 2017), highlighted that the use of terms that could unduly influence a jury ’s 
perception of a party should be excluded to preserve the integrity of the trial process.  Evidence is 
unfairly  prejudicial if it has “an undue tendency to suggest [a] decision on an improper basis, 
commonly,  though not necessarily, an emotional one.” U.S. v. Caraway , 534 F.3d 1290, 1301 
(10th Cir. 2008) (quoting Rule 402 adv. comm. notes).  
ARGUMENT  
I. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE #1 : Evidence or commentary regarding 
“smok ing shed ”. 
 
Throughout this litigation, Defendants have made it a point to refer to the yellow shed 
outside of the boy ’s bedroom window as the  "smoking shed" . So much so, that every one of 
Defendants ’ experts used the term smoking shed through out their reports and deposition testimony. 
The shed was not manufactured as a smoking shed , it was not named a smoking shed, and it is not 
sold as a smoking shed.  It is obvious that Defendants ’ use of the term smoking shed , at every 
oppo rtunity , is only intended to exacerbate the s ensibilities of a jury to evoke unnecessary 
emotional responses and biases  from them , with the r esult being their inevitable inability to make Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 3 of 9
4 
 a fair and impartial decision based on the facts of the case.  Stating that the  Plaintiffs used the shed 
from time  to smoke and shield them selves from the har sh weather is not the same as labeling it a 
smoking shed. The term does not pertain to the core issues of this case concerning the liability of 
Defendants for the alleged defects in the hoverboard that caused the catastrophic injuries to the 
Plaintiffs. Furthermore, the identification of the shed as a "smoking shed" is no t necessary for the 
Defendants to establish their defense that the fire originated from that location. Therefore, it should 
be deemed irrelevant.  The prejudicial effect of this term far exceeds any potential relevance it 
might have, warranting its exclusion.  The use of terms that could unduly influence a jury’s 
perception of a party should be excluded to preserve the integrity of the trial process . Meyer v. City 
of Cheyenne , 2017 WL 3461055 (D. Wyo. 2017) . Allowing such evidence would run afoul of the 
safeguards set for th in Federal Rules of Evidence 401 , 402, and 403 . As such, any reference to 
“smoking shed ” by Defendants, their coun sel, their experts , and all other wit nesses  must be strictly 
prohi bited .  
II. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 2: Exclusion of e vidence or commentary 
regarding an “improperly discarded cigar ette” causing or contributing to cause the 
underlying fire.  
 
Any evidence or commentary regarding an improperly discarded cigarette allegedly 
starting the fire must be precluded, as there is no actual  physical  or testamentary  evidence to 
support this claim. Defend ants’ own expert s agree. Deposition of Filas at pg. 79:4-19, Ex. A ; 
Deposition of Gorbett at 61:8-62:1 and 126:16 -22, Exhibit B. Allowing such commentary , 
argument , or attempt to introduc e testimony regarding this hypot hetical theory is the t ype of 
impermissible stacking of inferences and  uncorroborated  speculation  that the  Federal Rules of 
Evidence intend to protect against.  In Benson v. State of Wyoming , 2010 WL 4683851 (D. Wyo. 
2010), the court emphasized that speculative testimony without concrete evidence is inadmissible, Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 4 of 9
5 
 as it can mislead the jury and detract from the substantive issues of the case. The absence of factual 
support for the claim regarding a n improperly  discarded cigarette necessitates its exclusion under 
the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Plaintiffs further rely upon their arguments in the  briefs filed with 
their Daubert Motions against Defendants ’ experts Filas (Doc. 98 ) and Gor bett (Doc. 110) . For 
these reasons,  any reference to an “improperly discarded cigarette ” by Defendants, their counsel, 
their experts, or any other  witness , including attempts to present such as a  potential defense theory 
for causation,  must be strictly prohibited.  
III. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 3: Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Alcohol 
Use, Abuse or Intoxication . 
 
Any evidence or commentary regarding Stephanie's alcohol use the morning  of the fire, or 
any history of alcohol use or abuse, must be  excluded. Defendants have presented no evidence  
establishing that alcohol played any role in caus ing, or contributing to , this incident.  Without 
question, allow ing such evidence would be  extremely prejudicial and  would distract the jury and 
promote bias against the Plaintiff . Federal courts have consistently held that testimony regarding 
alcohol use is irrelevant where there is no evidence to establish a causal link to the incident. 
In Smith v. United States , 2011 WL 2160468 (D. Wyo. 2011), the court ruled that evidence of a 
party's alcohol consumption was inadmissible because it lacked a direct connection to the events 
at issue.  Allowing testimony of any alcohol consumption by Stephanie Wadswor th would only be 
intended to influen ce the jury into deciding the case  based upon biases  and prejudice, as opposed 
to the relevant facts and evidence in this case. Because intro duction of any alcohol evidence  or 
commentary  is irrelevant and inadmissible  under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402 and 403 , it 
must be excluded from trial.  
IV. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 4: Exclusion of Evidence Regarding House 
Being "De -Energized ". Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 5 of 9
6 
 Evidence or testimony suggesting that the house was "de -energized" at the time of the 
incident should also be excluded. The Defendants' experts failed to fully test and examine the 
electrical circuits throughout the entire house, choosing only to rely upon  the Bedroom #4 circuit 
to conclude that the entire house was de -energized. Th e conclusion  that therefore the entire house 
must have been de -energized  is speculative and based on an assumption with no foundation. The 
court in  Wyoming v. U.S. Department of Energy  emphasized that evidence without a factual basis 
can mislead the jury and is therefore inadmissible.  Plaintiffs have  fully set forth this argument in 
briefs supporting their Daubert Motions against Defendant s’ experts Strandjord (Doc. 95) and Filas 
(Doc. 98) , and would rely upon those argument s for purposes of precluding such evidence from 
trial. Even if relevant, the unreliable nature of such evidence deems it unfairly  prejudicial  and 
highly likely to  mislead a jury, in violation of Rule 403. For these reasons, such evidence must be 
excluded.  
V. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 5: Exclusion of Testimony from Defendant's 
Economist Exper t Regarding Loss of Services Utilizing Table 18 2 of “The Dollar 
Value of a Day ”. 
Testimony from the Defendant's forensic economist expert , Cha rity Row sey, relating to 
loss of services for Stephanie Wadsworth should be limited to the calculations  set forth in Table 
223 of the re source referenced  and relied upon by said expert, “The Dollar Value of a Day ”. Ms. 
Rowsey admitted in deposition  that she relied upon the wrong category, and should have relied 
upon Table 223 which specifically relates t o the category of " married women,  homemaker, not in 
labor force, spouse employed, all  ages, youngest  child ages six through twelve .” Deposition of 
Charity Rowsey at 37:2 – 38:9, Exhibit C. The significan ce in the change from her original table 
of reliance (Table  182) is in the value of a day , which when calculated  and applied to Mrs. 
Wad sworth is significant. Ms. Rowsey must be precluded from introduc ing evidence that the Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 6 of 9
7 
 applicable value of a day , as it rel ates to l oss of services, is any thing other than $80, as stated in 
Table 223 and affirmed by Ms. Rowsey to be correct. Any other testimony is incorrect, irrelevant , 
and would mislead  the jury. As established in  Holland v. Keller , introducing evidence that does 
not pertain directly to the claims at hand can lead to jury confusion and unfair prejudice.  For these 
reason s, Defendants must be precluded from intr oduction of evidence related to loss of services 
that are inconsisten t with the daily rate set forth in Table 223 of “The Dollar Value of a Day ”. 
VI. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 6: Exclusion of  Cumulative/ Duplicative  
Expert Testimony.  
 
The cumulative/ duplicative expert testimony of Filas , Strandjord and Gorbett should be 
excluded to prevent confusion and undue prejudice. The experts overlapping opinions on the issues 
of origin and causation must be limited to just one expert opini ng on tho se matters. Gor bett in 
particular  waded into b oth areas, clearl y duplicating opinions held by Filas. These ar guments have 
been fully set forth in briefs supporting Plaintiffs ’ Daubert Motions against Defendants’ experts 
Strandjord (Doc. 95) , Filas (Doc. 98),  and Gorbett (Doc. 110).  
Allowing multiple experts to testify on the same matter can lead to the risk of juror 
confusion and the potential for undue emphasis on certain aspects of the testimony. In  United 
States v. Hargrove , 2019 WL 2516279 (D. Wyo. 2019), the court noted that duplicative expert 
testimony can be excluded under FRE 403 as it may confuse the issues and mislead the jury. The 
court found that presenting multiple opinions on the same issue without clear different iation would 
not aid the jury in its understanding and could instead create unnecessary complexity.  For these 
reasons, all duplicative expert testimony must be excluded.  
VII. PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 7: Exclu sion of Expert Testimony  as set forth 
in Plaintiffs ’ Daubert Motions  
 
Plaintiffs would reallege  the bases of their Daubert Motions a gainst Defendants ’ experts , Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 7 of 9
8 
 Strandjord (Doc. 95) , Filas (Doc. 98),  and Gorbett (Doc. 110) , and would  rely upon the arguments 
set forth therein for the conclu sion that  said expert testimon ies are irrelevant, and even i f relevant 
are unfairly  prejudicial and misleading  to a jury, and thus inadmissible  under Rules 401, 402 and 
403.  
VIII.  PLAINTIFFS ’ MOTION IN LIMINE # 8: Exclusion of Evidence tha t Defendants 
product  is safe, and that a UL 2272 listing certifies that the product is  safe and cannot 
cause injury.  
Throughout multiple depositions, Defenda nts’ counsel has attempted to establish that the 
subject hoverbo ard is listed under UL 2272, and that such list ing is essentially a  certification  that 
their product is safe and cannot cause injury o r malfunction. In Woods v. BNSF Railway Co ., 2016 
WL 165971 (D. Wyo. 2016), the court held that allowing a defendant to present evidence of their 
product's safety or lack of prior incidents could skew the jury's perception and distract from the 
relevant issues at hand. Similarly, in Fitzgerald v. City of New York , 2018 WL 3037217 (S.D.N.Y. 
2018), the court ruled that evidence regarding a defendant's claims of safety and lack of prior 
injuries could mislead the jury, resulting in unfair prejudice against the plaintiff.  As such, 
Defendants must be precluded from pres enting argument or commentary that the subject 
hoverboard being listed under UL  2272 , or any other list ing, is synonymous with the hoverboard 
being certified as safe and inca pable of malfunctioning or causing injury. None of Defendants 
expe rts have testif ied that t o be true. And i n fact, evidence ex ists involving this very Defendant 
(Jetson) that a product being “certified ” under UL 2272 does not mean that it cannot be potentially 
dang erous or subject to malfunction (as seen with Jetson ’s rec all of the Rogue h overboard).  
CONCLUSION  
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court grant 
their motion s in limine and issue an Order excluding any evidence, argument, or reference to these Case 2:23-cv-00118-KHR     Document 141     Filed 01/22/25     Page 8 of 9
