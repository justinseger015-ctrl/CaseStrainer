Update progress_manager to use correct pipeline with clustering

Changed import message to clarify we're using extract_citations_with_clustering
which includes batch verification, not just the basic extraction pipeline.

This is a documentation/clarity fix - the code was already calling the correct
function at line 1009, but the import message was misleading.

The function extract_citations_with_clustering:
- Extracts citations with clean pipeline
- Clusters parallel citations  
- Runs batch verification with CourtListener API
- Returns citations with verified=True/False properly set

This ensures verified status is preserved through the entire pipeline.
