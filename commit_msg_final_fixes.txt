Fix cluster canonical data and case name extraction issues

Two critical fixes based on real production data analysis:

**FIX #1: Cluster Canonical Data Missing**
Problem: Clusters showed "Verifying Source: N/A" even when individual 
citations were verified. Frontend couldn't display cluster verification status.

Root Cause: Cluster-level canonical data wasn't being extracted from verified 
citations within the cluster.

Solution (unified_clustering_master.py lines 2102-2126):
- Extract canonical_name, canonical_date, verification_source from best_verified citation
- Set cluster verification_status='verified' if any citation in cluster is verified
- Add these fields to formatted_cluster output

Result: Clusters now show proper canonical data and verification source

**FIX #2: Case Name Extraction Contamination and Truncation**
Problem: Extracted case names contained:
- Citation text: "Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe , 31 Wn. App. 2d 343, 359-62"
- Signal words: "Id. For example, in Knocklong Corp. v. Kingdom of Afghanistan"
- Severe truncation: "agit Indian Tribe" (missing "Upper Sk")
- Company name truncation: "Mgmt., LLC" (missing company prefix)
- Plaintiff truncation: "Comm' v." "Co. v."

Solutions (unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py):

1. Enhanced Contamination Removal (lines 840-859):
   - Remove trailing citation text: r',\s*\d+\s+Wn\.\s*(?:App\.)?\s*\d+d?\s+\d+.*$'
   - Remove signal word prefixes: r'^Id\.\s*', r'^For\s+example,?\s+(in\s+)?'
   - Applied BEFORE other cleaning to catch embedded citations

2. Truncation Detection (lines 975-985):
   - Reject names starting with lowercase (e.g., "agit" clearly truncated)
   - Reject party names shorter than 3 characters
   - Prevents truncated fragments from being accepted

Expected Improvements:
- ✅ "Inc. v. Stillaguamish ... , 31 Wn. App. 2d 343" → "Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe"
- ✅ "Id. For example, in Knocklong" → "Knocklong Corp. v. Kingdom of Afghanistan"
- ✅ "agit Indian Tribe" → REJECTED (will use fallback strategy)
- ✅ "Mgmt., LLC" with no prefix → REJECTED (will use broader context)
