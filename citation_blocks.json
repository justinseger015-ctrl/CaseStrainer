Amicus Curiae Br. by Rest. L. Ctr., \nWash. Hosp. Ass’n & Int’l Franchise Ass’n at 7.  However, this argument was not raised by the defendant \nand is not within the scope of the certified question; therefore, we decline to consider the issue.  \n7 Both the defendant and amici argue that the job applicants who do not have a good faith intent to obtain \nemployment lack statutory standing because they are not within the zone of interest protected by the \nstatute and because they have not suffered an injury in fact, economic or otherwise.  We decline to \naddress the standing argument, as it is beyond the scope of the certified question.  See Carlsen v. Glob. \nClient Sols., LLC, 171 Wn.2d 486, 495 n.2, 256 P.3d 321 (2011) (declining to address the possibility of \npreemption since it is beyond the scope of the district court’s certified question).  The dissent argues that \nwe silently address whether a legislatively created statute can grant a plaintiff the right to sue even though \nthat plaintiff has suffered no harm and is not within the protected zone of interest.  We disagree.  Our \nholding is limited to interpreting the term “job applicant” in RCW 49.58.110(4).  However, we observe \nthat if a plaintiff meets the definition of job applicant, the plaintiff likely is within the protected zone of \ninterest.",
