FIX Issue 1: Remove citation text contamination from case names

Problem: Case names include trailing citation information
- "Inc. v. Stillaguamish Tribe, 31 Wn. App. 2d 343, 359-62"
- "Yakima v. Tribes, 502 U.S. 251, 255"

Solution (unified_case_name_extractor_v2.py):
Added comprehensive citation removal patterns:
- Washington reporters: Wn., Wash., Wn. App., etc.
- Federal reporters: U.S., S. Ct., L. Ed., F.3d, F. Supp.
- State reporters: P.3d, P.2d, etc.
- Old reporters: Wheat., Pet., How., Wall., Cranch
- Generic pattern for any reporter format

Applied to BOTH extraction methods for consistency.

Expected Results:
✅ "X v. Y, 502 U.S. 251, 255" -> "X v. Y"
✅ "X v. Y, 31 Wn. App. 2d 343" -> "X v. Y"
✅ "X v. Y, 123 F.3d 456" -> "X v. Y"

Patterns catch trailing commas + reporter citations.
