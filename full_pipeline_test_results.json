Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.

Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 identified by pseudonym in court records. The underlying case is a PRA1 injunction action, in which the petitioners (John Does P, Q, R, and S) sought to enjoin Thurston County (County) from releasing unredacted sex offender records in response to cross petitioner Donna Zink\u2019s PRA request. Over the course of these proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits, and Zink received most of the records she requested. The Does ultimately moved for voluntary dismissal but sought to do so without revealing their identities. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion and entered a permanent order to (1) maintain the use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case and (2) seal a court record (Disclosure Document) listing the Does\u2019 actual names. As a result, the Does have never been publicly identified, by name, as the plaintiffs in this case. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part and hold that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion because the trial court\u2019s findings are not sufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d 30, 640 P.2d 716 (1982). For similar reasons, the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym, and we hold the pseudonym issue is not moot. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary challenges raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for 1 Public Records Act, ch. 42.56 RCW. 2 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 review. We remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the pseudonyms in the Superior Court Management Information System (SCOMIS) indices be replaced with the Does\u2019 actual names. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND This case has a lengthy procedural history, including multiple appeals. It is not necessary to review this history in detail, but a brief overview provides important context for the issues presented. A.The Does bring a PRA injunction action in pseudonym and obtain a permanent injunction on summary judgment In October 2014, Zink made a PRA request for Thurston County\u2019s sex offender records, including any lists or databases, registration records, victim impact statements, and evaluations for special sex offender sentencing alternatives (SSOSAs) and special sex offender disposition alternatives (SSODAs). See RCW 9.94A.670; RCW 13.40.162. The County notified the sex offenders named in the records, including the Does, and began preparing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does are level I sex offenders.2 Does P and Q were convicted of sex offenses as adults; Does R 2 Level I sex offenders are \u201cthose classified as the least likely to reoffend.\u201d John Doe A v. Wash. State Patrol, 185 Wn.2d 363, 368, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). 3 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 and S were adjudicated as juveniles. Does P and S both attest they are compliant with their registration requirements, and Does R and Q have been relieved of the duty to register. In January 2015, the Does filed this action seeking to permanently enjoin the release of unredacted sex offender records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. The Does asserted several claims of exemption based on statutes outside the PRA governing the dissemination of sex offender records, health care information, and juvenile records. The Does subsequently moved for a preliminary injunction and for permission to proceed in pseudonym. In support, they filed declarations detailing the anticipated harms of being publicly identified as sex offenders, as well as several trial court orders granting similar relief in other cases. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to remain in pseudonym \u201cthroughout the pendency of this action.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 25. The court reasoned that pseudonyms were necessary to preserve the Does\u2019 ability to obtain relief, should they ultimately succeed in their PRA injunction action. However, the trial court did not conduct an Ishikawa analysis in accordance with article I, section 10 of the Washington Constitution.3 Instead, the court adopted the Does\u2019 argument that article I, section 10 is \u201cnot triggered\u201d by pseudonymous litigation. Id. at 748. 3 \u201cJustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d 4 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled in favor of the Does on all of their PRA exemption claims and found that the Does had \u201ccredibly attest[ed] to the substantial and irreparable harm to class members if the requested documents were disclosed without redactions.\u201d Id. at 32. Based on these rulings, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the County from releasing unredacted records in response to Zink\u2019s PRA request. B.Nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims are rejected, but the Does aregranted permission to remain in pseudonymThis action has been the subject of multiple appeals. Over the course ofappellate proceedings, nearly all of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims have been rejected on the merits. Zink filed her first appeal after the trial court granted summary judgment to the Does. While the appeal was pending, this court decided John Doe A v. Washington State Patrol, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for sex offender registration records that was materially identical to one of the Does\u2019 claims in this case. 185 Wn.2d 363, 374 P.3d 63 (2016). Thus, following John Doe A, the Court of Appeals here reversed in part and held \u201cthat the registration records must be released.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, 199 Wn. App. 280, 283, 399 P.3d 1195 (2017) (Doe I), modified on other grounds on remand, No. 48000-0-II (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2018) (Doe II) (unpublished), 5 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2048000-0-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. However, the Does\u2019 remaining PRA exemption claims and the use of pseudonyms were affirmed, and Zink petitioned for this court\u2019s review. While the petition for review was pending, this court decided John Doe G v. Department of Corrections, which rejected a PRA exemption claim for SSOSA evaluations that the Does had also raised in this case. 190 Wn.2d 185, 410 P.3d 1156 (2018). John Doe G further held, contrary to the trial court in this case, \u201cthat names in pleadings are subject to article I, section 10\u201d and that an order to proceed in pseudonym \u201cmust meet the Ishikawa factors,\u201d as well as GR 15. Id. at 201. Following John Doe G, the Court of Appeals reversed the order allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym and rejected all but one of the Does\u2019 PRA exemption claims. Doe II, No. 48000-0-II, slip op. at 11. However, the court held that \u201cunredacted SSODA evaluations are exempt\u201d because \u201cch. 13.50 RCW is an \u2018other statute\u2019 exemption that bars the release of juvenile justice and care records.\u201d Id. at 7. This holding is not challenged and does not affect our resolution of the issues presented. Although SSODA evaluations are exempt from the PRA, the Does acknowledge that all of their actual names (including those adjudicated as juveniles) appear in publicly available lists of sex offenders, which Zink compiled using public records obtained through PRA requests. See Letter from Am. C.L. 6 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Union of Wash. to Wash. Sup. Ct., John Doe P v. Zink, No. 102976-4 (Wash. Feb. 21, 2025) (Letter from Couns.); CP at 34. On remand in the trial court, the Does moved to remain in pseudonym based on the declarations they had previously submitted. Alternatively, the Does argued that John Doe G should not apply \u201cretroactively\u201d to them and sought to voluntarily dismiss their PRA injunction action without revealing their identities. CP at 678. The trial court ruled that GR 15 and Ishikawa had been met and entered an order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym for one year. However, the order expressly cautioned that it would be reviewed \u201cperiodically,\u201d and the court required the Does to file a sealed Disclosure Document listing their actual names \u201cin case it decides in the future that sealing the court record is not appropriate.\u201d Id. at 149. The trial court also lifted its permanent injunction, ordered the County to continue processing its response to Zink\u2019s PRA request, and issued a judgment for costs in favor of Zink with the Does listed as judgment debtors. Zink appealed the order sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and Zink did not seek further review. John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 56345-2-II (Wash. Ct. App. July 19, 2022) (Doe III) (unpublished), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/D2%2056345-2-II%20Unpublished%200pinion.pdf. 7 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 The Does subsequently moved for voluntary dismissal and to permanently seal their names in court records pertaining to their case by maintaining the use of pseudonyms and sealing the Disclosure Document indefinitely. In support, the Does refiled the same declarations supporting their original motion to proceed in pseudonym, as well as new declarations from each of the Does and Doe R\u2019s mother, Jane Roe R.Zink opposed the request to remain in pseudonym, arguing that the Does had not met their burden or, in the alternative, that any new sealing order should be limited to one year. The trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d CP at 431. Based on these findings, the court ordered the Does\u2019 actual names to remain sealed through the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. The trial court\u2019s order was permanent in duration, \u201cunless and until there is a subsequent motion\u201d supported by \u201cproof of compelling circumstances that sealing is no longer necessary.\u201d Id. at 433. Zink moved for reconsideration, but the court declined her request to set an expiration date for its order, reasoning that this \u201cwould unnecessarily clog the court with hearings that don\u2019t need to happen.\u201d Rep. of Proc. (Jan. 20, 2023) at 46. 8 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 C.The Court of Appeals reverses the order sealing the Disclosure Document but holds the continued use of pseudonyms is moot Zink appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and its order permanently sealing the Disclosure Document and allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym. The Court of Appeals reversed in part and held that the order sealing the Disclosure Document was an abuse of discretion in violation of GR 15. The court reasoned that \u201cthe information the Does sought to protect by filing their lawsuit\u2014their identities as sex offenders\u2014became publicly available\u201d long ago, and the Does had failed to \u201cidentify privacy or safety concerns specific to their identities as the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.\u201d John Doe P v. Thurston County, No. 85909-9-I, slip. op. at 6 (Wash. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2024) (Doe IV) (unpublished) (emphasis added), https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/859099.pdf. However, the Court of Appeals declined to reach Zink\u2019s evidentiary challenges and held the pseudonym issue was \u201cmoot\u201d because \u201cZink has received or will receive the records she is entitled to, no claims remain to be litigated, and the trial court dismissed the Does\u2019 lawsuit with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 8 n.12. The Does and Zink subsequently filed cross petitions for review, which we granted. The Does, Zink, and the County have all filed supplemental briefs. ISSUES A.Is the trial court\u2019s order allowing the permanent use of pseudonyms in court records pertaining to this case moot? 9 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 B.Did the trial court abuse its discretion in ordering the permanent useof pseudonyms and permanently sealing the Disclosure Document? ANALYSIS Our state constitution requires that \u201c[j]ustice in all cases shall be administered openly, and without unnecessary delay.\u201d CONST. art. I, \u00a7 10. The open administration of justice presumptively includes public access to the actual names of litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. However, the \u201cright of access . . . may be outweighed by some competing interest as determined by the trial court on a case-by-case basis according to the Ishikawa guidelines.\u201d Allied Daily Newspapers of Wash. v. Eikenberry, 121 Wn.2d 205, 211, 848 P.2d 1258 (1993). Thus, an order allowing a litigant to proceed or remain in pseudonym, including at the postdismissal stage, must be justified in accordance with both GR 15 and the Ishikawa factors. See John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 198-202. A trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion to seal court records is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d 351, 357, 302 P.3d 156 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion when it relies \u201con factsunsupported in the record,\u201d applies \u201cthe wrong legal standard,\u201d or \u201cadopts a view \u2018that no reasonable person would take.\u2019\u201d State v. Rohrich, 149 Wn.2d 647, 654, 71 P.3d 638 (2003) (quoting State v. Lewis, 115 Wn.2d 294, 298-99, 797 P.2d 1141(1990)). In determining the applicable legal standard, our review is de novo. In re 10 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Dependency of M.H.P, 184 Wn.2d 741, 753, 364 P.3d 94 (2015). In this case, the trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 and Ishikawa as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Does\u2019 request to remain in pseudonym and permanently seal the Disclosure Document. A.The order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot As a threshold issue, we must determine whether the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is a moot issue in this case. An issue is moot if \u201ca court can no longer provide effective relief.\u201d AURC III, LLC v. Point Ruston Phase II, LLC, 3 Wn.3d 80, 86, 546 P.3d 385 (2024). The Does and Zink correctly agree that the use of pseudonyms is not moot, and we reverse the Court of Appeals on this issue. The Court of Appeals held the use of pseudonyms was moot in light of John Doe A.However, in that case, the use of pseudonyms was moot because the public records at issue already identified \u201cthe names of the parties.\u201d John Doe A, 185 Wn.2d at 385. Because those records would be released, this court was \u201cunable to offer any further relief.\u201d Id. By contrast, in this case, the court can provide further effective relief if we reach the merits of the pseudonym issue. The trial court\u2019s order in this case seals the Does\u2019 actual names through both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. These dual aspects of the order operate independently to shield the Does\u2019 actual names from public view. Thus, regardless of whether Zink obtains the Does\u2019 real names by 11 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 unsealing the Disclosure Document, the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest in the open administration of justice\u201d continues to be impeded by the use of pseudonyms in court records, such as SCOMIS indices. Hundtofte v. Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d 1, 4, 330 P.3d 168 (2014) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added). Therefore, we hold the Does\u2019 continued use of pseudonyms is not moot. B.The trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 actual names contrary to GR 15 and Ishikawa On the merits, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permanently sealing the Does\u2019 identities at this postdismissal stage of the proceedings. As noted above, the Court of Appeals held the trial court abused its discretion, contrary to GR 15, but it declined to conduct \u201cthe more rigorous Ishikawa analysis.\u201d Doe IV, No. 85909-9-I, slip op. at 7 n.10. Because GR 15 embodies the principles set forth in Ishikawa, we address both on review. On the merits, we hold the trial court abused its discretion because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15 or Ishikawa as a matter of law. 1. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden pursuant to GR 15 \u201c[W]e must start with the presumption of openness when determining whether a court record may be sealed from the public.\u201d Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 7. Therefore, an order sealing a court record must sufficiently identify \u201ccompelling privacy or safety concerns that outweigh the public interest in access 12 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 to the court record.\u201d GR 15(c)(2). In this case, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain permanently in pseudonym does not contain findings sufficient to satisfy GR 15 and was therefore an abuse of discretion. As discussed above, while the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action was pending, the trial court entered several preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym. These orders preserved the Does\u2019 \u201cability to seek relief\u201d in their PRA injunction action; in other words, because the Does\u2019 PRA injunction action sought to shield their identities as sex offenders, revealing the Does\u2019 identities in litigation would \u201ceviscerate\u201d their claims. CP at 25; see also id. at 148. The trial court\u2019s preliminary orders also found the Does faced \u201ca potential for a serious imminent threat of harm\u201d based on their declarations, which describe fears of \u201cbeing identified as a sex offender\u201d due to \u201cpersonal experiences of being \u2018ostracized\u2019\u201d and knowledge of others who \u201cwere regularly harassed and beat up because people found out they were sex offenders.\u201d Id. at 148, 164, 814. However, over the course of this litigation, these preliminary findings allowing the Does to bring their action in pseudonym have lost their force. When each of the Does\u2019 identities as sex offenders became publicly available, the harms of publicly revealing that information became moot. Similarly, when the Does voluntarily dismissed their PRA injunction action, their ability to seek relief ended. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings allowing the use of pseudonyms while the action 13 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 was pending are not sufficient, as a matter of law, to justify the continued use of pseudonyms following dismissal. Yet, the trial court\u2019s order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym postdismissal does not sufficiently articulate new compelling privacy or safety concerns. Instead, the trial court noted that the \u201cDoes have been allowed to proceed in pseudonym since the start of the case in 2015\u201d and found that the Does had \u201cagain established compelling privacy and safety concerns and a serious imminent threat of numerous forms of harm if their names are revealed . . . that sufficiently outweigh the public interest and the requesters\u2019 interests.\u201d Id. at 430-31. This conclusory finding is insufficient as a matter of law. See John Doe G,190 Wn.2d at 202. On review, the Does argue that they articulated sufficient privacy and safety concerns to remain in pseudonym postdismissal, pointing to their declarations expressing concerns of being identified \u201cin association with this lawsuit.\u201d CP at 809. Yet, the substance of these concerns derives from \u201cthe label \u2018sex offender\u2019\u201dand \u201chow sex offenders get targeted by vigilantes,\u201d not participation in a PRA action. Id. at 809, 820. As noted above, the Does have confirmed that their actual names now appear on publicly available lists of sex offenders compiled by Zink.4 4 Jane Roe R\u2019s name does not appear on the lists; she is Doe R\u2019s mother, and she filed a declaration in support of sealing the Does\u2019 actual names. However, she is not a party to this 14 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Letter from Couns., supra. Further, it is undisputed Zink compiled these lists using public records she obtained through PRA requests. See id.; CP at 34. Thus, \u201cby participating in this case, the John Does are not subject to any disclosures that should otherwise be exempt.\u201d John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. The trial court\u2019s findings are insufficient to justify the continued use of pseudonyms and sealing of the Disclosure Document following dismissal of the Does\u2019 action. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion contrary to GR 15. 2. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Does met their burden in accordance with Ishikawa GR 15 is a court rule, but it derives from the principles of Ishikawa and article I, section 10\u2019s \u201c\u2018separate, clear and specific provision [that] entitles the public . . . to openly administered justice.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 36 (quoting Cohen v. Everett City Council, 85 Wn.2d 385, 388, 535 P.2d 801 (1975)). Therefore, in addition to complying with GR 15, an order permitting a party to proceed in pseudonym must satisfy the Ishikawa factors: (1) identify the need to seal court records, (2) allow anyone present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, (3) determine whether the requested method is the least restrictive means of protecting the interests threatened, (4) weigh the competing interests and consider alternative methods, and (5) issue an order no broader than necessary. action and she does not articulate any reason to shield her identity independently of her son\u2019s. Therefore, we do not conduct an independent analysis as to Jane Roe R. 15 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 199 (citing Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37-39). Each Ishikawa factor \u201c\u2018should be articulated in [the court\u2019s] findings and conclusions, which should be as specific as possible rather than conclusory.\u2019\u201d Id. at 202 (alteration in original) (quoting Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38). Here, the trial court\u2019s order summarily addresses each of the Ishikawa factors, but its findings are conclusory and not sufficiently supported by the record. The first Ishikawa factor requires a showing that public access to the Does\u2019 identities in connection with this action \u201cmust be restricted to prevent a serious and imminent threat to an important interest.\u201d 97 Wn.2d at 37. This \u201c\u2018is more specific, concrete, certain, and definite than\u2019 the \u2018compelling privacy or safety concerns\u2019 required by GR 15(c)(2).\u201d M.H.P., 184 Wn.2d at 765 (quoting State v. Waldon, 148 Wn. App. 952, 962-63, 202 P.3d 325 (2009)). However, as discussed above, the harms specifically articulated by the Does\u2019 declarations are based on their identities as sex offenders, not PRA plaintiffs. Therefore, it was an abuse of discretion to rely on these concerns in support of the first Ishikawa factor. The Does also articulate broader concerns that if \u201cpseudonym reversal\u201d is permitted on appeal, it will \u201cchill[ ] sensitive parties from engaging in meritorious litigation.\u201d Pet. for Rev. at 18, 1. However, as noted above, the trial court\u2019s preliminary orders allowing the Does to proceed in pseudonym were expressly time limited. Indeed, as discussed below, orders sealing presumptively open court 16 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 records are generally subject to \u201cdurational limits.\u201d Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362. Moreover, although we recognize the vital role that pseudonymous litigation plays in the development of our laws and the recognition of our rights, \u201cthe public\u2019s involvement plays a significant role\u201d in the legal system, as well. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 201. It has long been established that Washington courts are constitutionally prohibited from restricting the public\u2019s access to court records, absent \u201ca serious and imminent threat to an important interest,\u201d which must be articulated \u201cas specifically as possible.\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 37; see also Encarnaci\u00f3n, 181 Wn.2d at 9. Here, the Does \u201cdo not have a legitimate privacy interest to protect\u201d in their identities as sex offenders or as litigants. John Doe G, 190 Wn.2d at 200. Furthermore, this action was not brought to vindicate a constitutional right; the Does\u2019 underlying PRA exemption claims are statutory.5 Thus, the Does\u2019 concerns about protecting pseudonymous litigation in general, though wholeheartedly shared by this court, are insufficient to establish a specific need to shield their identities in this case. We hold the trial court abused its discretion in ruling the first Ishikawa factor was met. 5 Contra John Does 1 v. Seattle Police Dep\u2019t, 4 Wn.3d 343, 354, 563 P.3d 1037 (2025) (plaintiffs \u201casserted disclosure would violate their constitutional rights\u201d). 17 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 Before entering its order, the trial court offered those present in the courtroom an opportunity to object, satisfying the second Ishikawa factor. 97 Wn.2d at 38. The trial court also addressed the third and fourth Ishikawa factors, and ruled that allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym and sealing the Disclosure Document would be \u201cthe least restrictive means\u201d and the only \u201cviable alternative\u201d that would be \u201ceffective in protecting the interests threatened.\u201d CP at 432; Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 38. However, this was premised on the ruling that the first Ishikawa factor was met, which was an abuse of discretion. Where sealing is not justified, determining the least restrictive means is unnecessary. Finally, the fifth Ishikawa factor requires that any order \u201c\u2018must be no broader in its application or duration than necessary to serve its purpose.\u2019\u201d Ishikawa, 97 Wn.2d at 39 (quoting Federated Publ\u2019ns v. Kurtz, 94 Wn.2d 51, 64, 615 P.2d 440 (1980)). \u201cIf the order involves sealing of records, it shall apply for a specific time period with a burden on the proponent to come before the court at a time specified to justify continued sealing.\u201d Id. As we have previously recognized, \u201c[t]his factor requires the trial court to consider durational limits\u201d on orders to continue sealing \u201cpresumptively open\u201d court records, such as the order permitting pseudonymous litigation in this case. Richardson, 177 Wn.2d at 362, 360. However, the trial court declined to set an expiration date for its order, 18 John Doe P et al. v. Thurston County et al., No. 102976-4 effectively granting the Does a permanent right to remain in pseudonym. This was legal error and an abuse of discretion. CONCLUSION We affirm the Court of Appeals in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by sealing the Disclosure Document because its findings are insufficient to satisfy GR 15. We further hold that the order allowing the Does to remain in pseudonym is not moot and was also an abuse of discretion contrary to GR 15. In addition, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Ishikawa factors had been satisfied as to both the use of pseudonyms and the sealing of the Disclosure Document. Given our resolution of these issues, we decline to reach the evidentiary issues raised in Zink\u2019s cross petition for review. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions to (1) unseal the Disclosure Document, (2) use the Does\u2019 actual names in future proceedings and court records (if any) pertaining to this case, and (3) order that the Does\u2019 pseudonyms in the SCOMIS indices be replaced with their actual names. 19 John Doe P et al. v.
