Srebnick, P.A., Miami, FL, Howard Srebnick, Joshua Shore, Black, Srebnick, Kornspan & Stumpf, P.A., Miami, FL, for Petitioner., A federal statute provides that a court may freeze before trial certain assets belonging to a criminal defendant accused of violations of federal health care or banking laws. See 18 U.S.C. § 1345. Those assets include: (1) property \\"obtained as a result of\\" the crime, (2) property \\"traceable\\" to the crime, and (3) other \\"property of equivalent value.\\" § 1345(a)(2). In this case, the Government has obtained a court order that freezes assets belonging to the third category of property, namely, property that is untainted by the crime, and that belongs fully to the defendant. That order, the defendant says, prevents her from paying her lawyer. She claims that insofar as it does so, it violates her Sixth Amendment \\"right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for [her] defence.\\" We agree., The question presented is \\"[w]hether the pretrial restraint of a criminal defendant\'s legitimate, untainted assets (those not traceable to a criminal offense) needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\\" Pet. for Cert. ii. We see no reasonable way to interpret the relevant statutes to avoid answering this constitutional question. Cf. Monsanto, supra, at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657. Hence, we answer it, and our answer is that the pretrial restraint of legitimate, untainted assets needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Sixth Amendment. The nature and importance of the constitutional right taken together with the nature of the assets lead us to this conclusion., It is consequently not surprising: first, that this Court\'s opinions often refer to the right to counsel as \\"fundamental,\\" id ., at 68, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; see Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 243-244, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936) (similar); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (similar); second, that commentators describe the right as a \\"great engin[e] by which an innocent man can make the truth of his innocence visible,\\" Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L.J. 641, 643 (1996) ; see Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975) ; third, that we have understood the right to require that the Government provide counsel for an indigent defendant accused of all but the least serious crimes, see Gideon, supra, at 344, 83 S.Ct. 792 ; and fourth, that we have considered the wrongful deprivation of the right to counsel a \\"structural\\" error that so \\"affec[ts] the framework within which the trial proceeds\\" that courts may not even ask whether the error harmed the defendant. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 150, 126 S.Ct. 2557., Given the necessarily close working relationship between lawyer and client, the need for confidence, and the critical importance of trust, neither is it surprising that the Court has held that the Sixth Amendment grants a defendant \\"a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\\" Powell, supra, at 53, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; see Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 150, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (describing \\"these myriad aspects of representation\\"). This \\"fair opportunity\\" for the defendant to secure counsel of choice has limits. A defendant has no right, for example, to an attorney who is not a member of the bar, or who has a conflict of interest due to a relationship with an opposing party. See Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). And an indigent defendant, while entitled to adequate representation, has no right to have the Government pay for his preferred representational choice. See Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S., at 624, 109 S.Ct. 2646., The Government cannot, and does not, deny Luis\' right to be represented by a qualified attorney whom she chooses and can afford. But the Government would undermine the value of that right by taking from Luis the ability to use the funds she needs to pay for her chosen attorney. The Government points out that, while freezing the funds may have this consequence, there are important interests on the other side of the legal equation: It wishes to guarantee that those funds will be available later to help pay for statutory penalties (including forfeiture of untainted assets) and restitution, should it secure convictions. And it points to two cases from this Court, Caplin & Drysdale, supra, at 619, 109 S.Ct. 2646 and Monsanto, 491 U.S., at 615, 109 S.Ct. 2657 which, in the Government\'s view, hold that the Sixth Amendment does not pose an obstacle to its doing so here. In our view, however, the nature of the assets at issue *1090here differs from the assets at issue in those earlier cases. And that distinction makes a difference., The property at issue here, however, is not loot, contraband, or otherwise \\"tainted.\\" It belongs to the defendant. That fact undermines the Government\'s reliance upon precedent, for both Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto relied critically upon the fact that the property at issue was \\"tainted,\\" and that title to the property therefore had passed from the defendant to the Government before the court issued its order freezing (or otherwise disposing of) the assets., *1091In Monsanto, the Court considered a pretrial restraining order that prevented a not-yet-convicted defendant from using certain assets to pay for his lawyer. The defendant argued that, given this difference, Caplin & Drysdale \'s conclusion should not apply. The Court noted, however, that the property at issue was forfeitable under the same statute that was at issue in Caplin & Drysdale . See Monsanto, supra, at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657. And, as in Caplin & Drysdale, the application of that statute to Monsanto\'s case concerned only the pretrial restraint of assets that were traceable to the crime, see 491 U.S., at 602-603, 109 S.Ct. 2657 ; thus, the statute passed title to those funds at the time the crime was committed (i.e., before the trial), see § 853(c). The Court said that Caplin & Drysdale had already \\"weigh[ed] ... th[e] very interests\\" at issue. Monsanto, supra, at 616, 109 S.Ct. 2657. And it \\"rel[ied] on\\" its \\"conclusion\\" in Caplin & Drysdale to dispose of, and to reject, the defendant\'s \\"similar constitutional claims.\\" 491 U.S., at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657., Justice KENNEDY prefers to read Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto broadly, as holding that \\"the Government, having established probable cause to believe that Luis\' substitute [i.e., innocent] assets will be forfeitable upon conviction, should be permitted to obtain a restraining order barring her from spending those funds prior to trial.\\" Post, at 1106 (dissenting opinion). In other words, he believes that those cases stand for the proposition that property-whether tainted or untainted-is subject to pretrial restraint, so long as the property might someday be subject to forfeiture. But this reading asks too much of our precedents. For one thing, as discussed, Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto involved the restraint only of tainted assets, and thus we had no occasion to opine in those cases about the constitutionality of pretrial restraints of other, untainted assets., For another thing, Justice KENNEDY\'s broad rule ignores the statutory background against which Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto were decided. The Court in those cases referenced § 853(c) more than a dozen times. And it acknowledged that whether property is \\"forfeitable\\" or subject to pretrial restraint under Congress\' scheme is a nuanced inquiry that very much depends on who has the superior interest in the property at issue. See Caplin & Drysdale, supra, at 626-628, 109 S.Ct. 2646 ; Monsanto, 491 U.S., at 616, 109 S.Ct. 2657. We see this in, for example, § 853(e)(1), which explicitly authorizes restraining orders or injunctions against \\"property described in subsection (a) of this section\\" (i.e., tainted assets). We see this too in § 853(e)(1)(B), which requires the Government-in certain circumstances-to give \\"notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for hearing\\" before obtaining a restraining order against such property. We see this in § 853(c), which allows \\"bona fide purchaser[s] for value\\" to keep property that would otherwise be subject to forfeiture. And we see this in § 853(n)(6)(A), which exempts certain property from forfeiture when a third party can show a vested interest in the property that is \\"superior\\" to that of the Government., If we analogize to bankruptcy law, the Government, by application of § 853(c)\'s relation-back provision, became something like a secured creditor with a lien on the defendant\'s tainted assets superior to that of most any other party. See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[1] (16th ed. 2015). For this reason, § 853(c) has operated in our cases as a significant limitation on criminal defendants\' property rights in such assets-even before conviction. See Monsanto, supra, at 613, 109 S.Ct. 2657 (\\"Permitting a defendant to use [tainted] assets for his private purposes that, under this [relation-back] provision, will become the property of the United States if a conviction occurs cannot be sanctioned\\"); cf. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 326, 119 S.Ct. 1961, 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999) (noting that the Court had previously authorized injunctions against the further dissipation of property where, among other things, \\"the creditor (the Government) asserted an equitable lien on the property\\")., This distinction between (1) what is primarily \\"mine\\" (the defendant\'s) and (2) what is primarily \\"yours\\" (the Government\'s) does not by itself answer the constitutional question posed, for the law of *1093property sometimes allows a person without a present interest in a piece of property to impose restrictions upon a current owner, say, to prevent waste. A holder of a reversionary interest, for example, can prevent the owner of a life estate from wasting the property. See, e.g., Peterson v. Ferrell, 127 N.C. 169, 170, 37 S.E. 189, 190 (1900). Those who later may become beneficiaries of a trust are sometimes able to prevent the trustee from dissipating the trust\'s assets. See, e.g., Kollock v. Webb, 113 Ga. 762, 769, 39 S.E. 339, 343 (1901). And holders of a contingent, future executory interest in property (an interest that might become possessory at some point down the road) can, in limited circumstances, enjoin the activities of the current owner. See, e.g., Dees v. Cheuvronts, 240 Ill. 486, 491, 88 N.E. 1011, 1012 (1909) (\\"[E]quity w[ill] interfere ... only when it is made to appear that the contingency ... is reasonably certain to happen, and the waste is ... wanton and conscienceless\\"). The Government here seeks a somewhat analogous order, i.e., an order that will preserve Luis\' untainted assets so that they will be available to cover the costs of forfeiture and restitution if she is convicted, and if the court later determines that her tainted assets are insufficient or otherwise unavailable., The Government finds statutory authority for its request in language authorizing a court to enjoin a criminal defendant from, for example, disposing of innocent \\"property of equivalent value\\" to that of tainted property. 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2)(B)(i). But Luis needs some portion of those same funds to pay for the lawyer of her choice. Thus, the legal conflict arises. And, in our view, insofar as innocent (i.e., untainted) funds are needed to obtain counsel of choice, we believe that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the court order that the Government seeks., On the other side we find interests that include the Government\'s contingent interest in securing its punishment of choice (namely, criminal forfeiture) as well as the victims\' interest in securing restitution (notably, from funds belonging to the defendant, not the victims). While these interests are important, to deny the Government the order it requests will not inevitably undermine them, for, at least sometimes, the defendant may possess other assets-say, \\"tainted\\" property-that might be used for forfeitures and restitution. Cf. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S., at 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (\\"Deprivation of the right\\" to counsel of the defendant\'s choice \\"is \'complete\' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants\\"). Nor do the interests in obtaining payment of a criminal forfeiture or restitution order enjoy constitutional protection. Rather, despite their importance, compared to the right to counsel of choice, these interests would seem to lie somewhat further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system., Second, relevant legal tradition offers virtually no significant support for the Government\'s position. Rather, tradition *1094argues to the contrary. Describing the 18th-century English legal world (which recognized only a limited right to counsel), Blackstone wrote that \\"only\\" those \\"goods and chattels\\" that \\"a man has at the time of conviction shall be forfeited.\\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 388 (1765) (emphasis added); see 1 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 737 (1816) (\\"[T]he party indicted may sell any of [his property] ... to assist him in preparing for his defense on the trial\\")., As we have explained, supra, at 1090 - 1092, cases such as Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto permit the Government to freeze a defendant\'s assets pretrial, but the opinions in those cases highlight the fact that the property at issue was \\"tainted,\\" i.e., it did not belong entirely to the defendant. We have found no decision of this Court authorizing unfettered, pretrial forfeiture of the defendant\'s own \\"innocent\\" property-property with no connection to the charged crime. Nor do we see any grounds for distinguishing the historic preference against preconviction forfeitures from the preconviction restraint at issue here. As far as Luis\' Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is concerned, a restraining order might as well be a forfeiture; that is, the restraint itself suffices to completely deny this constitutional right. See Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557., Third, as a practical matter, to accept the Government\'s position could well erode the right to counsel to a considerably greater extent than we have so far indicated. To permit the Government to freeze Luis\' untainted assets would unleash a principle of constitutional law that would have no obvious stopping place. The statutory provision before us authorizing the present restraining order refers only to \\"banking law violation[s]\\" and \\"Federal health care offense[s].\\" 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2). But, in the Government\'s view, Congress could write more statutes authorizing pretrial restraints in cases involving other illegal behavior-after all, a broad range of such behavior can lead to postconviction forfeiture of untainted assets. See, e.g., § 1963(m) (providing for forfeiture of innocent, substitute assets for any violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act)., Moreover, the financial consequences of a criminal conviction are steep. Even beyond the forfeiture itself, criminal fines can be high, and restitution orders expensive. See, e.g., § 1344 ($1 million fine for bank fraud); § 3571 (mail and wire fraud fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations); United States v. Gushlak, 728 F.3d 184, 187, 203 (C.A.2 2013) ($17.5 million restitution award against an individual defendant in a fraud-*1095on-the-market case); FTC v. Trudeau, 662 F.3d 947, 949 (C.A.7 2011) ($37.6 million remedial sanction for fraud). How are defendants whose innocent assets are frozen in cases like these supposed to pay for a lawyer-particularly if they lack \\"tainted assets\\" because they are innocent, a class of defendants whom the right to counsel certainly seeks to protect? See Powell, 287 U.S., at 69, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; Amar, 84 Geo. L. J., at 643 (\\"[T]he Sixth Amendment is generally designed to elicit truth and protect innocence\\")., These defendants, rendered indigent, would fall back upon publicly paid counsel, including overworked and underpaid public defenders. As the Department of Justice explains, only 27 percent of county-based public defender offices have sufficient attorneys to meet nationally recommended caseload standards. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, D. Farole & L. Langton, Census of Public Defender Offices, 2007: County-based and Local Public Defender Offices, 2007, p. 10 (Sept. 2010). And as one amicus points out, \\"[m]any federal public defender organizations and lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act serve numerous clients and have only limited resources.\\" Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers 11. The upshot is a substantial risk that accepting the Government\'s views would-by increasing the government-paid-defender workload-render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect., We add that the constitutional line we have drawn should prove workable. That line distinguishes between a criminal defendant\'s (1) tainted funds and (2) innocent funds needed to pay for counsel. We concede, as Justice KENNEDY points out, post, at 1108 - 1110, that money is fungible; and sometimes it will be difficult to say whether a particular bank account contains tainted or untainted funds. But the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction we require in this case. With the help of those rules, the victim of a robbery, for example, will likely obtain the car that the robber used stolen money to buy. See, e.g., 1 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution § 2.14, p. 175 (1978) (\\"tracing\\" permits a claim against \\"an asset which is traceable to or the product of\\" tainted funds); 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts § 518, pp. 3309-3314 (1956) (describing the tracing rules governing commingled accounts). And those rules will likely also prevent Luis from benefiting from many of the money transfers and purchases Justice KENNEDY describes. See post, at 1108 - 1109., Courts use tracing rules in cases involving fraud, pension rights, bankruptcy, trusts, etc. See, e.g., Montanile v. Board of Trustees of Nat. Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan, 577 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct. 651, 659-660, 193 L.Ed.2d 556 (2016). They consequently have experience separating tainted assets from untainted assets, just as they have experience determining how much money is needed to cover the costs of a lawyer. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1345(b) (\\"The court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination of [actions to freeze a defendant\'s tainted or untainted assets]\\"); 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) (courts must determine reasonable attorneys\' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act); see also Kaley, 571 U.S., at ----, and n. 3, 134 S.Ct., at 1095, and n. 3 (\\"Since Monsanto, the lower courts have generally provided a hearing.... [to determine] whether probable cause exists to believe that the assets in dispute are traceable ... to the crime charged in the indictment\\"). We therefore see little reason to worry, as Justice KENNEDY seems to, that defendants *1096will \\"be allowed to circumvent [the usual forfeiture rules] by using ... funds to pay for a high, or even the highest, priced defense team [they] can find.\\" Post, at 1106.","nature_of_suit":"","posture":"","syllabus":"","headnotes":"","summary":"","disposition":"","history":"<p>In October 2012, a federal grand jury charged the petitioner, Sila Luis, with paying kickbacks, conspiring to commit fraud, and engaging in other crimes all related to health care. See § 1349; § 371; 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). The Government claimed that Luis had fraudulently obtained close to $45 million, almost all of which she had already spent. Believing it would convict Luis of the crimes charged, and hoping to preserve the $2 million remaining *1088in Luis\' possession for payment of restitution and other criminal penalties (often referred to as criminal forfeitures, which can include innocent-not just tainted-assets, a point of critical importance here), the Government sought a pretrial order prohibiting Luis from dissipating her assets. See 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2). And the District Court ultimately issued an order prohibiting her from \\"dissipating, or otherwise disposing of ... assets, real or personal ... up to the equivalent value of the proceeds of the Federal health care fraud ($45 million).\\" App. to Pet. for Cert. A-6.</p> <p>The Government and Luis agree that this court order will prevent Luis from using her own untainted funds, i.e., funds not connected with the crime, to hire counsel to defend her in her criminal case.

(similarly stipulating that Luis used \\"revenue not connected to the indictment\\" to pay for real property that she possessed). Although the District Court recognized that the order might prevent Luis from obtaining counsel of her choice, it held \\"that there is no Sixth Amendment right to use untainted, substitute assets to hire counsel.\\" 966 F.Supp.2d 1321, 1334 (S.D.Fla.2013).</p> <p>The Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Court.

The Government here seeks a somewhat analogous order,\\n    <em>\\n     i.e.,\\n    </em>\\n    an order that will preserve Luis\' untainted assets so that they will be available to cover the costs of forfeiture and restitution if she is convicted, and if the court later determines that her tainted assets are insufficient or otherwise unavailable.\\n   </attorneys><attorneys id=\\"p-39\\">\\n    The Government finds statutory authority for its request in language authorizing a court to enjoin a criminal defendant from, for example, disposing of innocent \\"property of equivalent value\\" to that of tainted property.\\n    <extracted-citation index=\\"100\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\\">\\n     18 U.S.C. § 1345\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    (a)(2)(B)(i). But Luis needs some portion of those same funds to pay for the lawyer of her choice. Thus, the legal conflict arises. And, in our view, insofar as innocent (\\n    <em>\\n     i.e.,\\n    </em>\\n    untainted) funds are needed to obtain counsel of choice, we believe that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the court order that the Government seeks.\\n   </attorneys><p id=\\"p-40\\">\\n    Three basic considerations lead us to this conclusion. First, the nature of the competing interests argues against this kind of court order. On the one side we find, as we have previously explained,\\n    <em>\\n     supra,\\n    </em>\\n    at 1088 - 1090, a Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel that is a fundamental constituent of due process of law, see\\n    <em>\\n     Powell,\\n    </em>\\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"101\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     287 U.S., at 68-69\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"102\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     53 S.Ct. 55\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    . And that right includes \\"the right to be represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire.\\"\\n    <em>\\n     Caplin &amp; Drysdale,\\n    </em>\\n    491 U.S., at 624,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"6217840\\" index=\\"103\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/617/#p631\\">\\n     109 S.Ct. 2646\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    . The order at issue in this case would seriously undermine that constitutional right.\\n   </p><attorneys id=\\"p-41\\">\\n    On the other side we find interests that include the Government\'s contingent interest in securing its punishment of choice (namely, criminal forfeiture) as well as the victims\' interest in securing restitution (notably, from funds belonging to the defendant, not the victims). While these interests are important, to deny the Government the order it requests will not inevitably undermine them, for, at least sometimes, the defendant may possess other assets-say, \\"tainted\\" property-that might be used for forfeitures and restitution. Cf.\\n    <em>\\n     Gonzalez-Lopez,\\n    </em>\\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\\"3500367\\" index=\\"104\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\\">\\n     548 U.S., at 148\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"3500367\\" index=\\"105\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\\">\\n     126 S.Ct. 2557\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    (\\"Deprivation of the right\\" to counsel of the defendant\'s choice \\"is \'complete\' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants\\"). Nor do the interests in obtaining payment of a criminal forfeiture or restitution order enjoy constitutional protection.

To permit the Government to freeze Luis\' untainted assets would unleash a principle of constitutional law that would have no obvious stopping place. The statutory provision before us authorizing the present restraining order refers only to \\"banking law violation[s]\\" and \\"Federal health care offense[s].\\"\\n    <extracted-citation index=\\"112\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\\">\\n     18 U.S.C. § 1345\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    (a)(2). But, in the Government\'s view, Congress could write more statutes authorizing pretrial restraints in cases involving other illegal behavior-after all, a broad range of such behavior can lead to postconviction forfeiture of untainted assets. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n    § 1963(m) (providing for forfeiture of innocent, substitute assets for any violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).\\n   </attorneys><attorneys id=\\"p-48\\">\\n    Moreover, the financial consequences of a criminal conviction are steep.

But the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction we require in this case. With the help of those rules, the victim of a robbery, for example, will likely obtain the car that the robber used stolen money to buy. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n    1 G.

Srebnick, P.A., Miami, FL, Howard Srebnick, Joshua Shore, Black, Srebnick, Kornspan & Stumpf, P.A., Miami, FL, for Petitioner., A federal statute provides that a court may freeze before trial certain assets belonging to a criminal defendant accused of violations of federal health care or banking laws. See 18 U.S.C. § 1345. Those assets include: (1) property \\"obtained as a result of\\" the crime, (2) property \\"traceable\\" to the crime, and (3) other \\"property of equivalent value.\\" § 1345(a)(2). In this case, the Government has obtained a court order that freezes assets belonging to the third category of property, namely, property that is untainted by the crime, and that belongs fully to the defendant. That order, the defendant says, prevents her from paying her lawyer. She claims that insofar as it does so, it violates her Sixth Amendment \\"right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for [her] defence.\\" We agree., The question presented is \\"[w]hether the pretrial restraint of a criminal defendant\'s legitimate, untainted assets (those not traceable to a criminal offense) needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\\" Pet. for Cert. ii. We see no reasonable way to interpret the relevant statutes to avoid answering this constitutional question. Cf. Monsanto, supra, at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657. Hence, we answer it, and our answer is that the pretrial restraint of legitimate, untainted assets needed to retain counsel of choice violates the Sixth Amendment. The nature and importance of the constitutional right taken together with the nature of the assets lead us to this conclusion., It is consequently not surprising: first, that this Court\'s opinions often refer to the right to counsel as \\"fundamental,\\" id ., at 68, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; see Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 243-244, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936) (similar); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462-463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (similar); second, that commentators describe the right as a \\"great engin[e] by which an innocent man can make the truth of his innocence visible,\\" Amar, Sixth Amendment First Principles, 84 Geo. L.J. 641, 643 (1996) ; see Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975) ; third, that we have understood the right to require that the Government provide counsel for an indigent defendant accused of all but the least serious crimes, see Gideon, supra, at 344, 83 S.Ct. 792 ; and fourth, that we have considered the wrongful deprivation of the right to counsel a \\"structural\\" error that so \\"affec[ts] the framework within which the trial proceeds\\" that courts may not even ask whether the error harmed the defendant. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 150, 126 S.Ct. 2557., Given the necessarily close working relationship between lawyer and client, the need for confidence, and the critical importance of trust, neither is it surprising that the Court has held that the Sixth Amendment grants a defendant \\"a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\\" Powell, supra, at 53, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; see Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 150, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (describing \\"these myriad aspects of representation\\"). This \\"fair opportunity\\" for the defendant to secure counsel of choice has limits. A defendant has no right, for example, to an attorney who is not a member of the bar, or who has a conflict of interest due to a relationship with an opposing party. See Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988). And an indigent defendant, while entitled to adequate representation, has no right to have the Government pay for his preferred representational choice. See Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S., at 624, 109 S.Ct. 2646., The Government cannot, and does not, deny Luis\' right to be represented by a qualified attorney whom she chooses and can afford. But the Government would undermine the value of that right by taking from Luis the ability to use the funds she needs to pay for her chosen attorney. The Government points out that, while freezing the funds may have this consequence, there are important interests on the other side of the legal equation: It wishes to guarantee that those funds will be available later to help pay for statutory penalties (including forfeiture of untainted assets) and restitution, should it secure convictions. And it points to two cases from this Court, Caplin & Drysdale, supra, at 619, 109 S.Ct. 2646 and Monsanto, 491 U.S., at 615, 109 S.Ct. 2657 which, in the Government\'s view, hold that the Sixth Amendment does not pose an obstacle to its doing so here. In our view, however, the nature of the assets at issue *1090here differs from the assets at issue in those earlier cases. And that distinction makes a difference., The property at issue here, however, is not loot, contraband, or otherwise \\"tainted.\\" It belongs to the defendant. That fact undermines the Government\'s reliance upon precedent, for both Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto relied critically upon the fact that the property at issue was \\"tainted,\\" and that title to the property therefore had passed from the defendant to the Government before the court issued its order freezing (or otherwise disposing of) the assets., *1091In Monsanto, the Court considered a pretrial restraining order that prevented a not-yet-convicted defendant from using certain assets to pay for his lawyer. The defendant argued that, given this difference, Caplin & Drysdale \'s conclusion should not apply. The Court noted, however, that the property at issue was forfeitable under the same statute that was at issue in Caplin & Drysdale . See Monsanto, supra, at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657. And, as in Caplin & Drysdale, the application of that statute to Monsanto\'s case concerned only the pretrial restraint of assets that were traceable to the crime, see 491 U.S., at 602-603, 109 S.Ct. 2657 ; thus, the statute passed title to those funds at the time the crime was committed (i.e., before the trial), see § 853(c). The Court said that Caplin & Drysdale had already \\"weigh[ed] ... th[e] very interests\\" at issue. Monsanto, supra, at 616, 109 S.Ct. 2657. And it \\"rel[ied] on\\" its \\"conclusion\\" in Caplin & Drysdale to dispose of, and to reject, the defendant\'s \\"similar constitutional claims.\\" 491 U.S., at 614, 109 S.Ct. 2657., Justice KENNEDY prefers to read Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto broadly, as holding that \\"the Government, having established probable cause to believe that Luis\' substitute [i.e., innocent] assets will be forfeitable upon conviction, should be permitted to obtain a restraining order barring her from spending those funds prior to trial.\\" Post, at 1106 (dissenting opinion). In other words, he believes that those cases stand for the proposition that property-whether tainted or untainted-is subject to pretrial restraint, so long as the property might someday be subject to forfeiture. But this reading asks too much of our precedents. For one thing, as discussed, Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto involved the restraint only of tainted assets, and thus we had no occasion to opine in those cases about the constitutionality of pretrial restraints of other, untainted assets., For another thing, Justice KENNEDY\'s broad rule ignores the statutory background against which Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto were decided. The Court in those cases referenced § 853(c) more than a dozen times. And it acknowledged that whether property is \\"forfeitable\\" or subject to pretrial restraint under Congress\' scheme is a nuanced inquiry that very much depends on who has the superior interest in the property at issue. See Caplin & Drysdale, supra, at 626-628, 109 S.Ct. 2646 ; Monsanto, 491 U.S., at 616, 109 S.Ct. 2657. We see this in, for example, § 853(e)(1), which explicitly authorizes restraining orders or injunctions against \\"property described in subsection (a) of this section\\" (i.e., tainted assets). We see this too in § 853(e)(1)(B), which requires the Government-in certain circumstances-to give \\"notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for hearing\\" before obtaining a restraining order against such property. We see this in § 853(c), which allows \\"bona fide purchaser[s] for value\\" to keep property that would otherwise be subject to forfeiture. And we see this in § 853(n)(6)(A), which exempts certain property from forfeiture when a third party can show a vested interest in the property that is \\"superior\\" to that of the Government., If we analogize to bankruptcy law, the Government, by application of § 853(c)\'s relation-back provision, became something like a secured creditor with a lien on the defendant\'s tainted assets superior to that of most any other party. See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[1] (16th ed. 2015). For this reason, § 853(c) has operated in our cases as a significant limitation on criminal defendants\' property rights in such assets-even before conviction. See Monsanto, supra, at 613, 109 S.Ct. 2657 (\\"Permitting a defendant to use [tainted] assets for his private purposes that, under this [relation-back] provision, will become the property of the United States if a conviction occurs cannot be sanctioned\\"); cf. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 326, 119 S.Ct. 1961, 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999) (noting that the Court had previously authorized injunctions against the further dissipation of property where, among other things, \\"the creditor (the Government) asserted an equitable lien on the property\\")., This distinction between (1) what is primarily \\"mine\\" (the defendant\'s) and (2) what is primarily \\"yours\\" (the Government\'s) does not by itself answer the constitutional question posed, for the law of *1093property sometimes allows a person without a present interest in a piece of property to impose restrictions upon a current owner, say, to prevent waste. A holder of a reversionary interest, for example, can prevent the owner of a life estate from wasting the property. See, e.g., Peterson v. Ferrell, 127 N.C. 169, 170, 37 S.E. 189, 190 (1900). Those who later may become beneficiaries of a trust are sometimes able to prevent the trustee from dissipating the trust\'s assets. See, e.g., Kollock v. Webb, 113 Ga. 762, 769, 39 S.E. 339, 343 (1901). And holders of a contingent, future executory interest in property (an interest that might become possessory at some point down the road) can, in limited circumstances, enjoin the activities of the current owner. See, e.g., Dees v. Cheuvronts, 240 Ill. 486, 491, 88 N.E. 1011, 1012 (1909) (\\"[E]quity w[ill] interfere ... only when it is made to appear that the contingency ... is reasonably certain to happen, and the waste is ... wanton and conscienceless\\"). The Government here seeks a somewhat analogous order, i.e., an order that will preserve Luis\' untainted assets so that they will be available to cover the costs of forfeiture and restitution if she is convicted, and if the court later determines that her tainted assets are insufficient or otherwise unavailable., The Government finds statutory authority for its request in language authorizing a court to enjoin a criminal defendant from, for example, disposing of innocent \\"property of equivalent value\\" to that of tainted property. 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2)(B)(i). But Luis needs some portion of those same funds to pay for the lawyer of her choice. Thus, the legal conflict arises. And, in our view, insofar as innocent (i.e., untainted) funds are needed to obtain counsel of choice, we believe that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the court order that the Government seeks., On the other side we find interests that include the Government\'s contingent interest in securing its punishment of choice (namely, criminal forfeiture) as well as the victims\' interest in securing restitution (notably, from funds belonging to the defendant, not the victims). While these interests are important, to deny the Government the order it requests will not inevitably undermine them, for, at least sometimes, the defendant may possess other assets-say, \\"tainted\\" property-that might be used for forfeitures and restitution. Cf. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S., at 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (\\"Deprivation of the right\\" to counsel of the defendant\'s choice \\"is \'complete\' when the defendant is erroneously prevented from being represented by the lawyer he wants\\"). Nor do the interests in obtaining payment of a criminal forfeiture or restitution order enjoy constitutional protection. Rather, despite their importance, compared to the right to counsel of choice, these interests would seem to lie somewhat further from the heart of a fair, effective criminal justice system., Second, relevant legal tradition offers virtually no significant support for the Government\'s position. Rather, tradition *1094argues to the contrary. Describing the 18th-century English legal world (which recognized only a limited right to counsel), Blackstone wrote that \\"only\\" those \\"goods and chattels\\" that \\"a man has at the time of conviction shall be forfeited.\\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 388 (1765) (emphasis added); see 1 J. Chitty, Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law 737 (1816) (\\"[T]he party indicted may sell any of [his property] ... to assist him in preparing for his defense on the trial\\")., As we have explained, supra, at 1090 - 1092, cases such as Caplin & Drysdale and Monsanto permit the Government to freeze a defendant\'s assets pretrial, but the opinions in those cases highlight the fact that the property at issue was \\"tainted,\\" i.e., it did not belong entirely to the defendant. We have found no decision of this Court authorizing unfettered, pretrial forfeiture of the defendant\'s own \\"innocent\\" property-property with no connection to the charged crime. Nor do we see any grounds for distinguishing the historic preference against preconviction forfeitures from the preconviction restraint at issue here. As far as Luis\' Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is concerned, a restraining order might as well be a forfeiture; that is, the restraint itself suffices to completely deny this constitutional right. See Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 148, 126 S.Ct. 2557., Third, as a practical matter, to accept the Government\'s position could well erode the right to counsel to a considerably greater extent than we have so far indicated. To permit the Government to freeze Luis\' untainted assets would unleash a principle of constitutional law that would have no obvious stopping place. The statutory provision before us authorizing the present restraining order refers only to \\"banking law violation[s]\\" and \\"Federal health care offense[s].\\" 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2). But, in the Government\'s view, Congress could write more statutes authorizing pretrial restraints in cases involving other illegal behavior-after all, a broad range of such behavior can lead to postconviction forfeiture of untainted assets. See, e.g., § 1963(m) (providing for forfeiture of innocent, substitute assets for any violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act)., Moreover, the financial consequences of a criminal conviction are steep. Even beyond the forfeiture itself, criminal fines can be high, and restitution orders expensive. See, e.g., § 1344 ($1 million fine for bank fraud); § 3571 (mail and wire fraud fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations); United States v. Gushlak, 728 F.3d 184, 187, 203 (C.A.2 2013) ($17.5 million restitution award against an individual defendant in a fraud-*1095on-the-market case); FTC v. Trudeau, 662 F.3d 947, 949 (C.A.7 2011) ($37.6 million remedial sanction for fraud). How are defendants whose innocent assets are frozen in cases like these supposed to pay for a lawyer-particularly if they lack \\"tainted assets\\" because they are innocent, a class of defendants whom the right to counsel certainly seeks to protect? See Powell, 287 U.S., at 69, 53 S.Ct. 55 ; Amar, 84 Geo. L. J., at 643 (\\"[T]he Sixth Amendment is generally designed to elicit truth and protect innocence\\")., These defendants, rendered indigent, would fall back upon publicly paid counsel, including overworked and underpaid public defenders. As the Department of Justice explains, only 27 percent of county-based public defender offices have sufficient attorneys to meet nationally recommended caseload standards. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, D. Farole & L. Langton, Census of Public Defender Offices, 2007: County-based and Local Public Defender Offices, 2007, p. 10 (Sept. 2010). And as one amicus points out, \\"[m]any federal public defender organizations and lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act serve numerous clients and have only limited resources.\\" Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers 11. The upshot is a substantial risk that accepting the Government\'s views would-by increasing the government-paid-defender workload-render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect., We add that the constitutional line we have drawn should prove workable. That line distinguishes between a criminal defendant\'s (1) tainted funds and (2) innocent funds needed to pay for counsel. We concede, as Justice KENNEDY points out, post, at 1108 - 1110, that money is fungible; and sometimes it will be difficult to say whether a particular bank account contains tainted or untainted funds. But the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction we require in this case. With the help of those rules, the victim of a robbery, for example, will likely obtain the car that the robber used stolen money to buy. See, e.g., 1 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution § 2.14, p. 175 (1978) (\\"tracing\\" permits a claim against \\"an asset which is traceable to or the product of\\" tainted funds); 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts § 518, pp. 3309-3314 (1956) (describing the tracing rules governing commingled accounts). And those rules will likely also prevent Luis from benefiting from many of the money transfers and purchases Justice KENNEDY describes. See post, at 1108 - 1109., Courts use tracing rules in cases involving fraud, pension rights, bankruptcy, trusts, etc. See, e.g., Montanile v. Board of Trustees of Nat. Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan, 577 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 136 S.Ct. 651, 659-660, 193 L.Ed.2d 556 (2016). They consequently have experience separating tainted assets from untainted assets, just as they have experience determining how much money is needed to cover the costs of a lawyer. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1345(b) (\\"The court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination of [actions to freeze a defendant\'s tainted or untainted assets]\\"); 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d) (courts must determine reasonable attorneys\' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act); see also Kaley, 571 U.S., at ----, and n. 3, 134 S.Ct., at 1095, and n. 3 (\\"Since Monsanto, the lower courts have generally provided a hearing.... [to determine] whether probable cause exists to believe that the assets in dispute are traceable ... to the crime charged in the indictment\\"). We therefore see little reason to worry, as Justice KENNEDY seems to, that defendants *1096will \\"be allowed to circumvent [the usual forfeiture rules] by using ... funds to pay for a high, or even the highest, priced defense team [they] can find.\\" Post, at 1106.","nature_of_suit":"","posture":"","syllabus":"","headnotes":"","summary":"","disposition":"","history":"<p>In October 2012, a federal grand jury charged the petitioner, Sila Luis, with paying kickbacks, conspiring to commit fraud, and engaging in other crimes all related to health care.

Believing it would convict Luis of the crimes charged, and hoping to preserve the $2 million remaining *1088in Luis\' possession for payment of restitution and other criminal penalties (often referred to as criminal forfeitures, which can include innocent-not just tainted-assets, a point of critical importance here), the Government sought a pretrial order prohibiting Luis from dissipating her assets. See 18 U.S.C. § 1345(a)(2).

On the one side we find, as we have previously explained,\\n    <em>\\n     supra,\\n    </em>\\n    at 1088 - 1090, a Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel that is a fundamental constituent of due process of law, see\\n    <em>\\n     Powell,\\n    </em>\\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"101\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     287 U.S., at 68-69\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"102\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     53 S.Ct. 55\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    .

The order at issue in this case would seriously undermine that constitutional right.\\n   </p><attorneys id=\\"p-41\\">\\n    On the other side we find interests that include the Government\'s contingent interest in securing its punishment of choice (namely, criminal forfeiture) as well as the victims\' interest in securing restitution (notably, from funds belonging to the defendant, not the victims). While these interests are important, to deny the Government the order it requests will not inevitably undermine them, for, at least sometimes, the defendant may possess other assets-say, \\"tainted\\" property-that might be used for forfeitures and restitution.

Nor do we see any grounds for distinguishing the historic preference against preconviction\\n    <em>\\n     forfeitures\\n    </em>\\n    from the preconviction\\n    <em>\\n     restraint\\n    </em>\\n    at issue here. As far as Luis\' Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice is concerned, a restraining order might as well be a forfeiture; that is, the restraint itself suffices to completely deny this constitutional right. See\\n    <em>\\n     Gonzalez-Lopez,\\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"3500367\\" index=\\"110\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\\">\\n      supra,\\n     </extracted-citation>\\n</em>\\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\\"3500367\\" index=\\"110\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\\">\\n     at 148\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"3500367\\" index=\\"111\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/140/#p148\\">\\n     126 S.Ct. 2557\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    .\\n   </attorneys><attorneys id=\\"p-47\\">\\n    Third, as a practical matter, to accept the Government\'s position could well erode the right to counsel to a considerably greater extent than we have so far indicated. To permit the Government to freeze Luis\' untainted assets would unleash a principle of constitutional law that would have no obvious stopping place. The statutory provision before us authorizing the present restraining order refers only to \\"banking law violation[s]\\" and \\"Federal health care offense[s].\\"\\n    <extracted-citation index=\\"112\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\\">\\n     18 U.S.C. § 1345\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    (a)(2). But, in the Government\'s view, Congress could write more statutes authorizing pretrial restraints in cases involving other illegal behavior-after all, a broad range of such behavior can lead to postconviction forfeiture of untainted assets. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n    § 1963(m) (providing for forfeiture of innocent, substitute assets for any violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).\\n   </attorneys><attorneys id=\\"p-48\\">\\n    Moreover, the financial consequences of a criminal conviction are steep. Even beyond the forfeiture itself, criminal fines can be high, and restitution orders expensive. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n    § 1344 ($1 million fine for bank fraud); § 3571 (mail and wire fraud fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations);\\n    <em>\\n     United States v.

How are defendants whose innocent assets are frozen in cases like these supposed to pay for a lawyer-particularly if they lack \\"tainted assets\\" because they are innocent, a class of defendants whom the right to counsel certainly seeks to protect? See\\n    <em>\\n     Powell,\\n    </em>\\n<extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"115\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     287 U.S., at 69\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"369864\\" index=\\"116\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/us/287/45/#p68\\">\\n     53 S.Ct. 55\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    ; Amar, 84 Geo.

And as one\\n    <em>\\n     amicus\\n    </em>\\n    points out, \\"[m]any federal public defender organizations and lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act serve numerous clients and have only limited resources.\\" Brief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers 11. The upshot is a substantial risk that accepting the Government\'s views would-by increasing the government-paid-defender workload-render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect.\\n   </attorneys><p id=\\"p-50\\">\\n    3\\n   </p><attorneys id=\\"p-51\\">\\n    We add that the constitutional line we have drawn should prove workable. That line distinguishes between a criminal defendant\'s (1) tainted funds and (2) innocent funds needed to pay for counsel. We concede, as Justice KENNEDY points out,\\n    <em>\\n     post,\\n    </em>\\n    at 1108 - 1110, that money is fungible; and sometimes it will be difficult to say whether a particular bank account contains tainted or untainted funds. But the law has tracing rules that help courts implement the kind of distinction we require in this case. With the help of those rules, the victim of a robbery, for example, will likely obtain the car that the robber used stolen money to buy. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n    1 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution § 2.14, p. 175 (1978) (\\"tracing\\" permits a claim against \\"an asset which is traceable to or the product of\\" tainted funds); 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts § 518, pp. 3309-3314 (1956) (describing the tracing rules governing commingled accounts). And those rules will likely also prevent Luis from benefiting from many of the money transfers and purchases Justice KENNEDY describes. See\\n    <em>\\n     post,\\n    </em>\\n    at 1108 - 1109.\\n   </attorneys><attorneys id=\\"p-52\\">\\n    Courts use tracing rules in cases involving fraud, pension rights, bankruptcy, trusts, etc. See,\\n    <em>\\n     e.g.,\\n    </em>\\n<em>\\n     Montanile v. Board of Trustees of Nat. Elevator Industry Health Benefit Plan,\\n    </em>\\n    577 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"12601264,12601263\\" index=\\"117\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/\\">\\n     136 S.Ct. 651\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    , 659-660,\\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\\"12601264\\" index=\\"118\\" url=\\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/651/12601264/\\">\\n     193 L.Ed.2d 556\\n    </extracted-citation>\\n    (2016). They consequently have experience separating tainted assets from untainted assets, just as they have experience determining how much money is needed to cover the costs of a lawyer.
